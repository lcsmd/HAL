  "transcript": "all right everyone I'm here with AI driver again we tested fsd2 when it was brand new and only in the hands of a few people now everybody has it so we wanted to just do a quick little drive and revisit how it's doing see if it's it's improved at all since our last Drive yeah going back to the spots it failed at yeah we were going to go check out that spot where we had a take over last time really smoothly going around the sto car there so you've got it on your car now how's it been for you it's um it's really really good like I I forget how good it is compared to like version 11 like I have little complaints right um you know where it does weird things like like that yeah but compared to version 11 it's just miles better um yeah it's it's interesting in my specific area I have a ton of on Lane roads that go into two-lane roads where you have to like you have to make a decision and uh that's so nice it's and waited for them very very nice good job and it didn't take anything away we're at a red light anyway yeah yeah exactly you might as well just be nice here um but in my car in the model y with Hardware 4 every time it approaches that it it swerves it goes like this and it can't decide and it it sometimes it'll do it for a really long time and just kind of go back and forth but on the hardware 3 Model S that we still have it doesn't do that huh it just chooses a lane that's so weird yeah same software version and that seem to um I think there is a little bit more weirdness on Hardware 4 because it's running the hardware 3 model and emulation mode mhm so they that was kind of surprising that Elon mentioned a little a few weeks ago he said the models of fsd2 we have right now are entirely trained on Hardware 3 and the hardware 4 cars just run them in emulation mode ah that makes sense I think I missed that tweet that makes a lot of sense though so we haven't even really seen what the capability of hardw 4 is yet when they train a hardware 4 specific model on Hardware 4 data but it's like you know you can emulate it and make it seem like it's Hardware 3 but it's always going to be not quite exact so there may be some little you know bugs here and there but um yeah I think for me this 1234 has felt very polished compared to like the 1233 and other builds a lot of the little stupid takeovers you know just kind of silly things seem to have been kind of polished out of there look at this guy just riding his bike in the middle of the street this guy going around a bus I mean it it just uh okay that's a little bit too much slowing down I think it thought I think it it was coming over you know I get it I understand why yeah kind like okay this bus isn't going to be able to fit between all these cars right and it's moving but you know I would call that sort of a mistake in judgment but it executed it in a way that was still comfortable like an older version of FSD might have you know slammed the brakes there or something like that but it's always just very smooth even if there's like a biker just running in front of you or something yeah that's my main takea away from version 12 even like what it was doing there like instead of after it broke or you know break for the bus it just followed at a distance instead of Cape trying to pass it like version 11's very robotic in that way where it would like keep trying to get around in some way but this one's just okay you know like let's just follow it at a distance as he can come into our lane all right so I think we got to get over one lane but it's very tight so this is going to be a tough one for it oh yeah these are those is this the stop light you were talking about last time where it was uh version 11 had trouble or was that a different one there like multiple stop signs in a row no I mean this was just the uh one of the takeovers we had on version 12 that actually worked fine on version 11 where it had those kind of um pillar things or those white things sticking out of the road and it kind of had to go in between them that's one of the annoyance I have about 12 compared to 11 is that it actually follows the law better about Stu shopping when it sees a yellow light whereas version 11 would be very much on the side of just going for it version 12 is like you know let me even just slam on the brakes if I need to to make this yellow light I was just going to say I've Had It Slam on the brakes a couple of times it's definitely disappointing when there's a light you could have easily made and it's and it stops yeah so something interesting I found about that is I've had a car that was kind of tailgating me before put it into a same situation and it didn't break yeah and I'm wondering how I can test that like testing yellows is something so tough because it's really hard to time and everything but it'd be really interesting to put it into an identical situation where a car is tailgating it versus nobody behind it and see if there's a difference I bet there would be you know what it's interesting I H have noticed that there are differences in Behavior at least it appears that there is when there's a car behind you like I've seen situations where it's kind of stuck at a stop sign then somebody comes up behind me and then it starts going or for example like um you know it's uh stopping at a stop sign but then someone else is coming up behind me sometimes I notice it takes off a little quicker yeah to sort of eliminate that potential point of contact it has to turn left the yeah I feel like it's going to miss the turn there's unless it just really does something crazy right now yeah I I can't see it getting into that turn line yeah I don't think it's happening yeah oh got to recover got to recover got to recover it kind of was like can I go there okay now it's trying to reroute yeah that was fine a little too much hesitation like that that stuff's going to happen I just think the important part is you know how it reacts to it oh this is going to be tough looks like it's going to miss it again here let me help it out a little bit here there's a route that it can maybe do that one's going to be a little tough too but yeah it needs to be a little bit better about rerouting in situations like this this is a very high traffic time so it's going to be more likely to miss things yeah and honestly like I think missing stuff like that is fine I think the recovery is by far it's all about the recovery yeah you're always going to have times where you just can't make it over for whatever reason it's all about how you respond to it yeah driving in San Francisco is very much a yeah like team effort with everybody like nobody knows what they're doing everybody's just kind of changing lanes and going wild and everybody just kind of has to yeah look at that good takeoff okay now he needs to change lanes to get over there but it's not I might miss this again let's let it do its thing yeah we haven't got honked at yet that's usually better than I do in my videos so actually I can only recall one time where version 12 had a well-deserved honk other than that it's been able to recover pretty well for most of the stuff I put it in yeah it's so interesting like there's no indication of what it's yeah doing you know what I mean we used to be able to look for like it highlighting blue cars and this and that to kind of he's not letting you in is he come on let's go car you can do it you can do it go there we go well that's one way to do it I thought we were going to be going across the gold bridge if you didn't miss that turn but yeah again you know if it's a robo taxi it misses the first turn as long as it can get back on track the passenger probably won't even notice and you can just get better and better at driving down that rate of M turns over time yeah yeah exactly and I honestly I mean I don't know about the whole mapping situation um it seems like some of the problems I'm having are not knowing certain Lanes go in certain directions so with the amount of data they're getting maybe even some like low definition maps of just yeah turning Lanes just so it doesn't have to see you know the lines ground definely it definitely does seem like they're incorporating that more mhm like the visualization seems to be showing stuff that's clearly not visible to the car sometimes like I've seen it just show stuff in the visualization other streets that like there's no way it can see that yeah yeah exactly and that's what you know that's honestly how good drivers do it too is they remember um certain areas it's not like it's mapping it out down to the millimeter with lar you know and pre-planning its route but it should know like oh hey when I get up here these two are turn lanes and this is the yeah it's interesting because they've got such a big Fleet that they could do really well with crowdsource mapping they could really get all the answers and just make it drop dead reliable it it seems like they're may be starting to do that more but they haven't talked a lot about it we really need like another AI day for them to update on what the latest is with what they're doing yeah I can't wait to see that maybe they'll give us a little bit of that in the robo taxi event probably not that's probably more of a vehicle unveil I wonder if that's it like just I don't know like it did the right thing so he somebody just waved us through and it went but like don't do that I wonder I wonder if it recognize that at all or it just was based on the paws or what maybe yeah and now we're making this poor guy who let us through it's like if you wouldn't have given us the rideway we wouldn't have had to hold up the three cars behind you but I mean it did a it did a right thing I mean he was just trying to be nice just Americans don't know how to drive through roundabout every time I get to one of those I'm like oh God I know seriously here we go I'm curious how you like the Yoke compared to the round steering wheel I noticed in a lot of your recent videos you've had the wheel you know my dad got the uh Model S with the Yol and uh he got it before there was a round wheel option and then they came out with the round wheel option and um you know he like his uh he had like his yolk start peeling or something which was a common issue with those early Yoles and um they said okay well we'll give you free replacement but would you like the Yoke of the round wheel and he said well give me the round wheel I don't you know like I don't really care about the Yol and then I drove the round wheel I'm like wow it's actually really nice to just have a round wheel you know you just have muscle memory around how to drive but the reason I got the yolk was just because of the visualization and like I'm making these videos and people can barely see anyway but at least the visualization is more visible without the top of the wheel and to me I'm like on FSD all the time in this thing so does it really matter what kind of wheel it is really not really that is very true cuz I think the uh this screen is even bigger than the old Legacy model SX and if you got a steering wheel covering it up but the O can be kind of fun too you know you feel like you're flying a fighter jet yeah I just I take the round wheel probably most of the time I thought your opinion would be interesting especially since you have a lot of miles with a cyber truck which also has kind of a Yol that one I really like theing yeah I can imagine really liking that one because you don't actually have to like turn it over yeah steered by wire it's got a top but it still kind of like Yol so I don't know you know t is kind of interesting every new vehicle they need like a new way to open the door and a new steering device yeah you they're Reinventing the wheel every car yeah literally so you know I mean they're trying things but you know it I can drive with any of them doesn't really matter yeah I tried to yoke out for a couple of months but like I I felt like I was chasing the wheel too watch um it it does take time to adapt your muscle memory to learn how to use it and some people just might not care enough to do that why not just go with what you're familiar with yeah I just like I'm the laziest St I like putting on autopilot and like setting my hand on top of my knee and it just doesn't move unless I unless I need it well that was one thing I liked about the Yol too at first is I felt like it was a little easier to hold on autopilot but now I don't really hold it that much so all right this is the spot y yeah this is this is exactly so last video was having issues with these uh trying to get in think this is a new one too is it I don't know kind of looks like it maybe someone on autopilot knocked down one of the old ones all right so we made it in and we're going to have to have some kind of a route oh do you want to go down what's that yeah that one stre yeah that one street by the by the Golden Gate yeah yeah let's try that because that's I think that's what we did last time yeah okay it's just gonna keep going let's see 201 [Music] Marine Drive this looks like an interesting route oh yeah yeah it's very curvy yeah so you got these two people walking here yeah it's waiting for them okay now they see us just the the parking lots especially man the diff like they're kind of like walking in the road right now I don't in the car for being hesitant here no this is kind of the right thing to do it is totally but man what a difference from version 11 man like I mean it's crazy that it can figure out how to navigate a parking lot with people walking mhm they really won't get out of the way it's going to make its move go go go I did a test I was doing a live stream of full self-driving I did a test for my my wife was like purposely trying to block the car and I swear it felt like it was getting more aggressive every time like what all right here's the Moment of Truth yeah so coming left has it gotten any better at the sort of internal occupancy Network here yeah so it has to do a wide turn my gut tells me it's going to do the same thing but let's see maybe I'm not giving it enough credit good uh intuition there no signal from the model y naughty naughty okay yeah an aramoto what does that show up on the visualization as car small car yeah oh my god oh there's so much wow yeah there's a lot there's a lot going on right now go you guys I know it's your right oh man this stuff drives me crazy everybody's gonna everybody's waving each other through yeah go we'd all get okay okay now we got to go though you're you're stuck okay it went through yeah nice no disengagement this time we did it we did it man so it is getting better although that was kind of a bizarre situation I mean I think the humans were just as confused used like true it didn't do any worse than they did really as soon as it gets to the point where everybody's like no you go no you go instead of following the rideway like yeah just send it I might not have sent it in that exact moment but eventually I definitely would have as well it's so far so good no interventions we even went through a parking lot laugh I mean this is what I've been dreaming of for a long time that we I I could just give it a bunch of destinations and it just does it yeah and I don't have to turn it off yeah no for sure see I don't know what is going on I think it's probably slowing down oh it's trying to go over here okay that's why I was waiting for him okay wow this is pretty wild I did not expect it to go this way oh yeah you chose a crazy route yeah okay yeah um I remember thinking about the occupancy Network thing like oh my God how are they going to fix that like it's going to take forever I knew they could do it because the old occupancy Network could do it I knew they were going to obviously but I didn't expect it to be dealt with so quickly yeah and even the first version of version 12 I got it was doing really a rough job with unprotected turns and like I remember thinking like wow it's probably a consequence of going you know to this new endtoend system and it's probably going to take and the very next update it was way better unprotected turns now I've been very surprised at how quickly they can fix things it's like okay this architecture really is pretty good yeah and then the other thing that really excited me is looking at like the grock vision thing and like have you used like chat GPT with vision do you have the chat GPT plus yeah I mean these things have like a level of understanding of the world that's like we did not expect computers to have that level of oh oh oh interesting okay oh my God all right well you know it wasn't right but it wasn't the funny thing is like I I have a video my car going through here perfectly even had to deal with another car and it went through perfectly my God off the road completely I mean a for creativity yeah you know oh man it took The Road Less Traveled and that made all the difference that was funny that was yeah you know feels like it's got some personality sometimes it really does I think it was assessing again want it to go that way yeah it really does feel like it's uh okay so it has yeah it has to go right but we need to go around this thing yeah so doing much better with those uh those things yeah whatever you call them ballards ballards let's ask Chad TPT Vision yeah just take a picture sure ask God yeah I uh I stress out about that stuff quite frequently yeah what the world is going to look like in another 10 years or so and how nobody seems remotely prepared for it yeah I mean everything's going to change and it's pretty good like you know so I was playing with thisso AI song generator thing and you just t a few sentences and it generates a whole song and you're kind of like people could have like a custom soundtrack like you're just having a conversation with your friend and like some music starts playing and it's like going along with your conversation or something like you could have a custom soundtrack for your life that's like based on what you're doing you know like a movie soundtrack look at that electric self-driving Jaguar whmo BMW iix and a Tesla and then one gas car a lot of Whos today yeah these llms you know you can like it kind of just blows my mind you can ask them like okay um where does this person look like they want to go you know like oh well um you know they're holding a shopping bag and they're coming out of the store so they're probably going to go to the parking lot to their car yeah you know yeah no that's uh it it genuinely like scares me how much the large language models have picked up on stuff like that when their only job is to predict the next word and they're learning things because it makes that job easier but like it's and I wonder how much full self-driving is picking up on like the person who waved us through the stop sign yeah I'm sure there's data in there of similar things happening yeah it's just wild crazy how just a few months ago in January we're trying version 12 driving a lot of these same roads and we had several takeovers and now we haven't had any takeovers yet mhm the way this one behaves does seem a little more biased towards safety at all times um it's a little overly cautious yeah yeah especially compared to some of the yeah the first build or even you know the build that I would have really wanted well I guess I probably I say this I probably wouldn't want but the one that Elon live streamed like the very first iteration of version 12 that thing ignored all the the painted ground markings for the stop sign it blew through them and would stop right where humans stopped you know it wouldn't do the come to a full stop and then come to a secondary stop check this out this guy wants to cross but we want to get in there yeah wave to the robo car yeah yeah you're welcome when they wave to the robot and he's going down the same way we're going down yeah this is where vers like version 11 would have struggled with this yeah like harsh inputs at a bare minimum is like and slamming on the brakes catching up and going for it and slamming on the BR right I mean this is just so natural and comfortable like you can have real world stuff going on and just sit back and watch and it's not an issue that they're cyclists here at all yeah just keeping a bit yeah just keeping a bit of a distance not trying to and a very natural distance a very natural speed I doubt someone behind me would even be able to tell that this is a software driven car see and man the way it protects stuff like it was ready for that car to go around him you know giving him more room I've had it do stuff like that too where there's a car stuck in the road and there's cars waiting to go around and it preemptively gives them a ton of space yeah it can predict the behavior of other agents and it's kind of picking just the right speed with the auto speed so that it doesn't have to slow down when it gets here it's also being very cautious with the crosswalk H it's just this part always amazes me just the way I mean I guess I I can really only compare it to version 11 I just spent so much time with older versions of autopilot this is the part that really like amazes me or it can just continue on of micro breaking for everything and this is the part that really makes me think of the robot like okay if I can have this thing and can tell like okay go over here go over there and it can just move around the city entirely on its own without any input from me and it can walk alongside these humans and give these cyclist space while also respecting these guys running understand the relative speed of a bike versus a jogger like watch all these things in real time and react and um you know a humanoid robot could probably do that too it could probably walk alongside these people and not get hit as well so it's like okay there really is something here we've been able to make robots for a while but now we can actually make a robot brain yeah it feels different feels very different feels like it's alive in a weird way all right you think Gro grock is going to get added to the cars Apple Chestnut Street I do yeah that would be pretty wild I think it's kind of inevitable like they need an llm voice assistant in the car mhm and obviously Elon owns xai so that's probably going to be the one they use and they've also release it as a free model which is awesome so anyone can just use it and they can you know connect to Twitter find stuff in real time and it's like pretty good you know you like ask it something and ask chat GPT or Claude or whatever and it's like the same response you know really good quality which is like wow I really like the uh the summaries it does of like world news where I can just quickly go through it I like how he can summarize what's happening on X yeah okay here's this pothole look at this you see it it kind of slowed down oh yeah it's definitely slowing down whoa did it just still react to a no yeah people um people have said that it doesn't react but I've for sure had it react to a few potholes um I went into this was on an unreleased video I think I just have it on my I've had old builds that just went through that at normal speed of 12 oh really yeah interesting anyway might I mean I'm just saying I've had it definitely react I've caught it on video where I've like went through a construction site where there was multiple huge Pooles and purposely like went back into the lane and re-engaged and uh it swerved away like so maybe not all Pooles but some of them it's definitely seeing there was another um issue where it wouldn't make that U-turn you know how it kind of went around and turned around and went back this way without me taking over in the past it would kind of just go straight and then stop on 12 which it didn't really do on 11 so they fixed that as well like a lot of little issues are getting fixed what I'm seeing is that the process of fixing an issue has been dramatically streamlined it's not like an engineer looking at something and writing code it's just like okay throw more of these in the training set and then boom you can fix like a thousand different issues people have without having to like think about each issue yeah uh so something I wanted to ask is they said they have a pretty crazy QA process where it takes quite a while for these models to actually get release on cars you know like publicly owned cars like we have so I know they've be or they've suddenly became not training constrained in the last few comp ConEd yeah so do you think those models that have been built since then are on our cars now or do you think they're waiting or do you think like because I almost feel like there's some is this is a crazy intersection yeah there's a hill there's people running there's cars coming there's occlusion so you can't see the cars coming there's like this winding thing so you can't really think we're good yeah I can't see behind oh there we go we're good um but yeah like chat GPT has a I don't know like some Foundation model and they can modify certain aspects of it after the fact do you think full self-driving is similar to that where they can modify certain parameters of the way it behaves without retraining the entire thing from scratch or do you think like that every dot version we're seeing is like a brand new model I don't have a ton of technical details but there is the ability to sort of like you know fine-tune the model MH so fine-tuning is much less computationally intensive you can kind of steer the behavior more in one way or another but you know I think they've been adding compute gradually over time I think they have a ton of h100s up and I think that they are making some progress on dojo and actually being able to use that cuz there have been rumors that they're trying to build a big Dojo data center in Texas and they've got one that they're building in Buffalo so it seems like maybe that's part of the equation here and that's probably helped them alleviate their compute constraint a little bit but it's hard to say for sure yeah we need another AI day we do the robo taxi unveil will be interesting but that'll be more of a product unveil I'm really interested to see what design they have for that thing like what is Fran's take on a driverless vehicle yeah fron seems really excited about it yeah I mean I think this nextg platform is going to be a pretty big deal oh man things getting really good you know a lot of people said oh you know they're doing a robo taxi I don't know is FSD GNA be good enough but I think it's honestly in two years have the robot taxi ready you know if it's ready a little early it's probably better than having it ready late in my opinion no yeah and I definitely think the approach there on is the right one you know we saw how we saw saw like basically I think you got it after one year of development um of when they were kind of just like okay you know we're going to go all in on this approach and we didn't see updates or any real meaningful version 11 updates for a while and if it got that good in a year while they were uh compute constrained right I can only imagine now you know if they have everything all their uh h100 clusters all spun up ready to go yeah this is going to be a really funnier and then apparently the smart summon in Reverse is uh going to be in 12.4 and that one's getting ready to release before the free trial is over o before the free trial is over you say not only it not only is it going to be able to do like three-point turns and parking lots with smart summon it'll be able to reverse just in normal FSD mode too so sometimes I have these scenarios where it kind of gets stuck and it needs to reverse but it can't so now it'll actually be able to notice that reverse and get out which will be pretty cool and then they're also shift uh shipping an auto shift feature which is uh auto shift uh like they've had auto shift out of park but now it has auto shift all the time so you can do a three-point turn without touching the touch screen somehow to shift you just it just kind of goes you know reverse Drive yeah they got a pretty cool spring update coming I really hope that gets included on cars with gear stocks like mine M so I think I mean I would use it yeah it's pretty cool both my Teslas have it now cybertruck and Model S yeah yeah everybody who I've uh heard that uses it says it works surprisingly well it works like 95% of the time ever have a sketchy moment where it you you're uh headed the wrong direction I mean usually I just look at the arrow and then you know the camera pops up if you're in Reverse yeah but sometimes there are moments where you're like oh then you just stop it quickly all right so hopefully that auto shift can help with that I got all right being pretty cautious on this roundabout looks like there's a cyclist that's like right in the way or a couple of cyclists actually three of them so pretty well done kind of an unne there is the honk there's the honk yeah that was a little bit of an unnecessary stuff I think it was probably those people sitting on the bench and thought they might be Crossing or something maybe yeah well now it's a real full self-driving video exactly this guy's pissed oh my God wait until you come to a full stop at the stop sign he's going to lose his  I know what the why are you stopping you getting mad at a computer yeah he's he's like chasing me now he is he's tailgating you I did feel the car accelerate quicker yeah exactly cuz it knows we're in a road rage incident I know Jesus this guy jokes on him he's getting mad at a computer love that cut through the lanes right there so smooth nice Escape I just think that's so funny oh there he comes there he is maybe he wasn't yeah you showed [Laughter] us we have is illegal maneuver on video it's going to be on YouTube I'm sure everybody is going to Care yeah another uh something similar happened where I was uh driving down Fisherman's Warf mhm and you know there's uh there's a you know everybody's walking everywhere throughout the rad everybody's kind of going slow and there was this mustang in front of me just revving up his engine you know getting the people out of the way and everybody's like holding their kid like oh my God it's like these are the people who are so against full self-driving cars and they're the ones who are going to make it happen like look how much time this guy saved by doing all those crazy things look how much time he saved we're still in the same place yeah like and that happens all the time where somebody does some wild stuff well that's the thing is when you're driving everything so personal he because oh my God this guy's not moving now I have to wait here right yeah when somebody does that on epis I'm like okay it's not my problem car is handling it I don't have to lift a finger you know I just bring everyone's blood pressure down I think to have FSD no definitely and then you know I think also like so we're seeing now that it's able to do zero intervention drives although maybe that off-road arguably should have been an intervention but for the most part it's able to do the drives with zero interventions and now it's more just like things like that like annoying people you know you stopped when you didn't need to that's the kind of thing that it needs to improve on and I think it actually will get to a point where the driving is so humanlike that it never even does something like that like slowing down when it's not needed mhm like it'll just be so natural that it'll you know make mistakes like that like less often than a human I I've really started to kind of like get a glimpse at it it's starting to be able to predict things before I can like I'm just kind of you know like the other day I was driving and there was a guy on a scooter by the sidewalk and he gave someone a kiss you know while he's on the scooter and then my car stops and then he just scoots out right in front of me and I'm like I didn't even predict that that was going to happen and I'm like thinking like did it maybe like figure out that like a goodbye kiss is like a sign that you're like about to like probably not I'm probably like overanalyzing it um but it like it kind of seemed like that to me like it kind of seemed like I don't know something gave away that he was going to do that and it picked up on it before I figured it out oh I got one for you man there's a by my house it's 25 but it's four lanes and and it's huge but the car always goes 35 37 there like every human does the other day I was with my wife and we pulled into that area and there was a cop sitting on the side of the road and for the first time ever it went 25 oh my god really yeah like I I swear to you like I wish I had it recorded the my wife is a witness so I mean she can test but for the very first time it did not speed when there happened to be a cop I mean if you think about it you just sort of train it naively it should follow the law better when there's a cop around cuz that's what it sees humans do oh my gosh so look how it anticipated that I know I didn't even I didn't even see that so good it had already reacted before I thought about it this is the stuff like feel like version 12 really shines when you're dealing with all these yeah thousand things going on at once kind of scenarios right really does shine all right well I think that's good for our drive yeah overall pretty good definitely an improvement over the last time we did a drive together yeah can't wait for the next one man yeah we're getting pretty good I mean this thing's going to end our career as testers nobody's going to watch these videos anymore like why is you know why is this a video I just took this to work this morning that's what I'm struggling with the most right now is everybody's like oh more full self-driving videos and I've actually gone out to film in like the areas that I used to film in and it's boring yeah like nothing interesting happens exactly I used to like give commentary like I would have done this and it did this and blah but now it's like well it's just doing it a little slow sometimes but yeah and you know it's so funny just you know the
