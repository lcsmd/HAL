    "transcript":  "hey everyone and welcome back in this video I\u0027m going to go over the brand new uh perplexity Pages feature that uh as far as I understand just dropped today um I just happened to see uh I think a Discord message about it and so I came to check it out uh was playing around with it for the last couple hours and um what it is going to allow uh bloggers to do uh and people that are interested in using AI for writing is they\u0027re going to be able to create a um a pretty high quality cited draft uh within a matter of minutes um you could have done this with perplexity in a different way but it was a lot more manual uh previously and so uh this is just a faster way to um get your first draft so the term that we\u0027re going to go after is how to get rid of uh White scratches on cars um I don\u0027t know a whole lot uh about cars um or how to get white scratches out so this is not um something that I have subject matter expertise in and I\u0027ve also created a surfer editor so that we can quickly score the article just for the purposes of this demonstration and um yeah so again drop today we\u0027re just going to go right into it so to get into Pages um you do unfortunately have to have a pro account so if you don\u0027t have a pro subscription uh you\u0027ll have to you know try it out for a month um even though you get a couple Pro searches for free on the free account um to it looks like to uh get this plus button here you you do need to have Pro um so assuming you are signed up um this is what it\u0027s going to allow you to do just going to hover over Library uh click plus go page and there will be a completely new um UI that uh you\u0027ve never seen before until today um and so this is kind of where you\u0027re going to put your key uh phrase um so I\u0027m just going to grab it here okay and what it\u0027s going to do is um as you would imagine it\u0027s going to create a page for you which is why called pages and um it effectively writes a very short blog for you um and the way that this uh feature was meant to be used was to sort of curate uh the specific questions that you had in the specific order um so that you could uh you know quickly achieve whatever it is that you\u0027re trying to learn about um sometimes here it will give you a great image sometimes it\u0027ll give you a video um but in this case it just gave me a stock image um don\u0027t know if I really like that but um let\u0027s see if we do let\u0027s see white scratches or maybe like buff out scratches maybe something like that I don\u0027t actually know where it\u0027s pulling from uh it looks like oh okay looks like it\u0027s got some I assume this is YouTube uh let\u0027s see you can click watch oh maybe it\u0027s in the preview yeah okay so this is uh YouTube um so I\u0027m going to go back to editing and so we\u0027ve got a video there that\u0027s fine um it\u0027s got a little intro and then so at this point we need to decide basically what headers that we need um you can insert a section in between uh any paragraphs or you can add media um so if I quickly come back to server here I need to figure out uh so we\u0027ve got light scratches deep scratches repair scratch remover okay so um one of the things I\u0027m probably going to need to talk about at some point let\u0027s see touch a paint okay so this didn\u0027t uh generate a great first three it was okay uh so I I did take a look at a couple of the um Pages here so here they talk about toothpaste nail polish baking powder vinegar as like possible hacks um in this one they talked about uh okay let\u0027s see can I fix it myself so DIY okay uh can I fix the toothpaste so toothpaste seems to be like kind of common uh what do I do for deeper scratches um so what I\u0027m going to do I\u0027m just going to grab this header and I\u0027m going to put this is probably as worth having a section so I\u0027m going to do um uh first one I\u0027m going to do is DIY ways to remove scratches on cars okay um and I think I want this to be a list and uh so there\u0027s a couple options here you can do uh concise which is what it gives you by default uh if you do detailed it\u0027ll just be a longer version of that uh like it says more thorough um then you can you have a couple of options here so you can do text media plus text or just media only and then here you\u0027ve got paragraph table and list which are basically all the components that a typical blog post organiz have um so DIY ways is probably going to be a section that I want I kind of want it in a list so it can just you know this can be like an H2 that goes into some h3s um so again it has listed toothpaste rubbing compound sandpaper okay so it\u0027s giving me a very similar list um I\u0027m not sure if that yeah it is citing all the sources so that\u0027s great uh where it\u0027s actually getting this from so these seem to be kind of the main parts um so I\u0027m going to do a section about okay so I think we have applying toothpaste uh I actually don\u0027t like this section so what I\u0027m going to do is um Center a section called um how to fix scratches with toothpaste uh and I want this to be a paragraph and I think I want some media this time and let\u0027s see where is it here we go okay so that\u0027s not the right okay so it\u0027s giving me techniques okay so that\u0027s great um I don\u0027t like this image so this one\u0027s way better it\u0027s actually got toothpaste in it so that\u0027s great did I reuse that already um no I didn\u0027t okay um so what\u0027s next uh rubbing compound using rubbing compound Okay so we\u0027ve already got that in there the next one sandpaper and touchup I think was the last one here and tou paint okay so those are the methods um so what\u0027s next what\u0027s something that we might want to do um so we our term is specifically so what you\u0027ll notice is that it replaced my original term how to get rid of white scratches which is actually what I want um so I\u0027m going to grab that this one is just how to remove scratches easily in general but I want to know specifically how to remove white scratches so this is going to be further up uh because this is my main uh term so just ignore the fact that it rewrote your title um so I\u0027m going to do this and see what it says about removing white scratches specifically to see if it\u0027s uh any different okay so it does talk about okay and it found me a video great um okay and it\u0027s giving me some instruction so uh I I just need to remember to rewrite this header to be specific spefic to White scratches so I\u0027ll just take a mental note of that uh what else do I want to learn about um okay repair kits so maybe I\u0027ve got uh I\u0027m just looking at other articles here so let\u0027s do um uh choosing the best scratch repair kit and let\u0027s say I want a table uh maybe it\u0027s what are the best scratch repair kits and um okay let\u0027s do that all right so we\u0027ve got some brands that I have seen before and as always with perplexity it has really good uh sighting so you know this one\u0027s from Car and Driver which is a huge brand in the car uh industry obviously um if you\u0027ve ever seen their magazines on the stands so it\u0027s got a nice table for me here and that\u0027s perfect um something else let\u0027s see what other people are talking about um Turtle Wax scratch repair okay can I use Turtle Wax to fix scratches and I\u0027m going to I don\u0027t know if this matters but Turtle Wax is a brand um I\u0027m going to make sure this is back on basically answer ing the question so we\u0027ve now got 1 two three four five six seven sections so this is probably going to be at least 1,00 to 1500 words give or take um and then I\u0027m just going to put one more maybe like uh car scratch repair cost breakdown and uh probably one table for that okay great so what I\u0027m going to do is I\u0027m just going to I don\u0027t think they have a way to copy this entire thing yet um so I\u0027m I\u0027m not really using this the way it\u0027s supposed to be used you\u0027re supposed to publish it and then uh basically you\u0027ll get a share link and which um other um you know people on the internet can can get access to uh what I don\u0027t know is whether or not this page is actually going to be indexed because um if it is there\u0027s some SEO implications there because if we start writing really longtail keywords um we may just see a bunch of perplexity articles uh I don\u0027t you know I don\u0027t really like the sound of that so hopefully the team has taken into account um that aspect but uh what I\u0027m going to do is I\u0027m just G to control a uh copy and then I\u0027m just going to paste this whole thing just to check the score and of course it\u0027s going to bring all the ugly images and everything in there but right off the bat first try which was uh obviously I couldn\u0027t plan that because the AI can write whatever it wants um I\u0027ve got a 70 score before I go and optimize everything now what has happened is um you know it looks like it probably could use a couple more headings could maybe use a couple more words but really workhound is not really that important as long as we cover the topic comprehensively um but you know again if you\u0027ve been doing SEO for a little while now um I think you can see the implications of this and I basically have to go through and fix you know fix all the tables so that they work properly um you\u0027re going to want to retype a bunch of these paragraphs but basically the entire first draft was generated we\u0027re going we\u0027re at 11 minutes right now um so you know in probably under 10 minutes if you got used to doing this process you\u0027re going to have basically all of your topics uh covered and then you just come in here and massage uh the paragraphs however you want you know for example you would um turn oops turn on the wait is it this one yeah highlight terms um so that you don\u0027t accidentally delete any of these keywords um that are important um and yeah you know you basically away you go and optimizing um of course you have to fix all these images you can\u0027t just use these images and um what it\u0027s also going to save you time doing is uh the uh external linking so let\u0027s say this top one is you know notably my most important paragraph because I\u0027m going to rename it to you know how to uh buff out white scratches or whatever the keyword was but I\u0027ve got a bunch of sources here so Wiki high high Authority detail experts maybe high high 30 probably not doesn\u0027t look like it I\u0027ve never heard of that so I probably skip it so looks like Wiki how uh I might decide to embed this YouTube link right into my article um because somebody\u0027s already made a really great video on it um so I think all these sources seem to be uh here we go I can click yeah so they\u0027re all basically the same for sources but you know on and on the next section obviously is going to have different sources um so we\u0027ve got a couple more oh we\u0027ve got a wired in there now so that\u0027s a high Authority Source if I want to um if I want to link out uh externally and so you just go through each paragraph at a time um and hopefully save yourself a bunch of time um you know creating your your first draft and yes that\u0027s just otherwise just some of the other features you can come in here and edit if you don\u0027t like that generation you can just redo it again um and then under the more section is basically they don\u0027t have a drag and drop feature at the moment I I think hopefully they\u0027ll they\u0027ll add that but you just kind of have to manually move it up and down or delete it all together um but again I\u0027m not really using this the way the page function was meant to be used um this was meant to share information like let\u0027s say you were going on a uh vacation and you want a detailed plan of every city that you\u0027re going to um you would kind of do all your research here uh with the help of perplexity and then you would publish and then um you would get your share link uh and and then just you know share it to your friends for for that particular thread uh that\u0027s how it\u0027s supposed to be used but I when I saw this feature right away I knew uh because it was hyper optimized for short form uh and it could do tables and it could do lists and those are all the basically the features that we need to create uh a good blog um so of course I\u0027m not advocating that you just paste it in there publish it and then this is your blog that\u0027s not going to work it\u0027s not going to rank properly you do need to go in there and rewrite um you\u0027ll probably want to rewrite a substantial portion of it but you can keep all the ideas um that in the topics and the flow that it has put together for you so if you\u0027re uh not a natural writer like myself um this actually saves me a ton of time on how to do transitioning uh what parts to keep in and of course the just massive amount of um research that the tool does for you so hopefully that was helpful um if it was make sure you like And subscribe um I I really enjoy making these types of videos um and and just going like over the shoulder so so you guys can see uh not only like telling you how to do things but actually just showing you exactly how I would go through um and and and create these uh pieces you know in in subsequent videos I\u0027m actually going to go through a full uh breakdown of an entire article that I will eventually publish um but you know that\u0027ll be a really long form uh video so thanks for watching",
