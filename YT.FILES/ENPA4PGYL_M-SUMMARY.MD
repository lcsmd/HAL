ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
A Python script crashes due to an IndexError, indicating an attempt to access an empty list element.

MAIN POINTS:
1. The error occurred while running a Python script.
2. The script was executed using a command-line interface.
3. The traceback originates from a custom executable named `yt.exe`.
4. The issue is located in a module within a virtual environment.
5. The error is triggered by accessing a list element at an invalid index.
6. The problematic code attempts to retrieve video duration information.
7. The error suggests the video response list is unexpectedly empty.
8. The script is part of a package installed in a user's local directory.
9. The failure occurs within a function designed to handle main operations.
10. The script interacts with YouTube content, likely for video processing or information retrieval.

TAKEAWAYS:
1. Always validate list elements before accessing them to prevent `IndexError`.
2. Ensure API responses or data collections are not empty before processing.
3. Use try-except blocks to handle potential runtime errors gracefully.
4. Verify the existence of expected data in external responses.
5. Debugging information like tracebacks is crucial for diagnosing and fixing errors in code.
