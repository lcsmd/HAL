  "transcript": "[Music] it's Sunday April 21 2024 I'm Anthony Davis welcome to the weekend show where we make the time to consider the news of the week you can support my work and independent journalism at patreon.com 5minute newws our guest today is a former Trump staa turned Anonymous whistleblower who exposed the former president's misconduct while in office his book blowback is the product of almost a 100 conversations with former Trump officials and warns of the danger of a second Trump presidency Miles Taylor welcome to the weekend show it's great to be with you my friend so firstly I I want to talk talk about the the role of the Whistleblower and how for me as a as a European you know seeing the us through through a European lens whistleblowers I've found in America seem to be looked down upon whereas where I'm from they are celebrated and worthy of Medals of Honor so you know obviously it takes a lot to to want to blow the whistle especially when you are I mean you describe yourself as a lifelong conservative and somebody who was working in National Security so just just if you can explain how I think not just yourself but other people who Trump might refer to as the the Deep state are able to maintain their their role no matter who the administration is but then feel the need to to go against their own political allegiance and and speak up uh yeah it's there there's a lot to unpack there and you know and and hopefully this will be valuable to the folks that are listening and and and as we were talking about in The Green Green Room Anthony this is definitely going to be the most watched and most listened to episode ever and I don't know if you announced this Midas Touch is offering up a Lamborghini for for one guest that listens to the show this week no I'm kidding um look I've struggled with the word whistleblower and and and whether I even am one or not I mean when you come forward not just in politics to sound the alarm but really in anything now you are met instantly with crowd sourced opinions sometimes violently supportive sometimes just violent and I was called Everything a traitor and a hero and a disgruntled employee by the president uh and a you know savior of democracy I don't think I'm any of those things I I don't think I'm a hero I don't think I'm a traitor I think I just did my job and that job was more than just being the chief of staff of a government Department that job was being an American public servant and as everyone knows you don't swear allegiance to the president of the United States you swear allegiance to the Constitution and so the point at which you are being asked to do things that are literally by definition legally anti-constitutional is when your obligation supersedes your boss and the only Authority you are accountable to if something is in contravention of the Constitution are the American people themselves they are The Sovereign they are the voters they are the ones to decide whether to rehire or fire the person who executes the laws of the United States and you know in that standpoint if if coming forward to reveal that anti-constitutional activity makes me a traiter then I'm a traiter um you know and if it makes me a whistleblower uh then I'm a whistleblower but you know one of the things I've found Anthony in wrestling with this term is that people who end up falling into that category like you said of of whistleblower are being treated very differently right now in the United States there is a lot of animosity towards the folks who have come out to disclose Donald Trump's behavior and his inclinations towards illegality uh but you know you interview each of those people which I did for blowback almost all of them that have come forward and spoken out about him I I interviewed them and one of the first questions I had for all of my peers that have gotten into this mess is would you do it again and I did not expect the universality of the answer that I received from those people almost to a person and we're talking about people who've lost their homes and their jobs and everything people who' just blown up their lives to turn against the guy almost to a person they've said yes I would do it again and I think that's one of the few Hallmarks of a whistleblower that I've found is that despite all of the blowback which is the term of the book but despite all the blowback that can come from it people still feel like going and telling the truth was more valuable that is a powerful message to me and again is not something that I thought was a foregone conclusion as I started to huddle with some of these folks just explain to us about the term blowback because it's it's actually a a term used to describe unintended consequences within the realm of national sec cacy right yeah you know originally that term was used a lot in the world that I spent most of my career in in the National Security realm and and usually blowback is meant to signify the unintended consequences of when you fail to see around a corner you know so if you're deploying a a convoy uh into somewhere like Somalia to go uh intercept a terrorist suspect you know if you if you fail to plan correctly for that mission or or fail to take certain elements into account you might experience blowback it might mean the Convoy gets attacked or ambushed uh and and I've expropriated the term into this world that we are walking into as a country namely if we fail to anticipate what will happen if we return Donald Trump to the White House then we could suffer the unintended consequences the blowback could be quite severe and quite frankly Anthony the book was born out of a lot of frustration is and I don't want to knock you know my peers that have spoken out from the Trump Administration but generally a lot of people left that Administration and went and wrote self- laudatory books about just how amazing they were and too few were painting a picture for us of what could happen if that guy came back to Power and so finally I said you know I'm just I'm just going to go do it I'm going to go paint as Lucid of a portrait as I can of what a second term would look like under Donald Trump or a savier successor if he doesn't make it back into the White House because that's what we need to foresee in order to prevent blowback we need someone to give us a little bit of a crystal ball and says you know here's what the guy will do so we can make that choice in November with very very clear eyes and and so that's what I set out uh to do with this and it's not the book I wanted to write uh you know I I did not want to write this book I don't want to be promoting this book I don't want to be talking about it because I never anticipated we would be so foolish to put ourselves back in this same damn predicament but we have and so it's important to talk honestly about what the repercussions would be I I want to talk about the the danger of a future Trump presidency a little bit later but first I want to talk about this polarization that means that there are a core Trump support or a core number of trump supporters who see you as uh you know somebody who's who's done the wrong thing rather than the right thing and that is due to this compartmentalization where people think that you're either in one camp or the other if you say anything bad about Donald Trump you must be a Democrat or a snowflake or or something there's very little gray you know it's all black and white in in the in the narrative and and the media does play into that as well so so let's just talk about this notion and I mean we've heard similar from Alexander vidman for example you know was listening on the on the phone call when Trump tried to extort Vladimir zalinski he was just doing his job he didn't feel like he was being a whistleblower either and yet because Trump was the president he saw it as an anti-trump action rather than something that had a higher cause so so just to react to this notion that how because I'm very keen to Define what Trump is is trying to say is the Deep State and and and make people realize that actually the the government the Federal Government is made up of really very good people no matter their political allegiance well it is and and look I will start off by saying I remain a a conservative um and I in fact think Donald Trump is not a conservative I I am ideologically philosophically intellectually a conservative as defined in American politics and we don't have to go into political philosophy here and go deep but for those that are well read enough I mean I'm a Friedrich Hayek Milton fredman what they would call a classical liberal but is is you know over the past few decades ass assumed the the terminology of a conservative in American politics I'm I'm a small L libertarian and that means that I'm actually not a huge fan of Joe Biden's policies but why did I vote for Joe Biden in 2020 after serving for Donald Trump and why do I continue to support him for the presidency in 2024 is because you have to in a circumstance like this put country over party you have to say there are things more important than my party's policy positions and so you know I still believe very strongly in that I think it's very important um but you know you you do have folks who've become so tribal that they have difficulty even seeing that justification and you know Trump has tried to portray anyone who's spoken out against him from within the Republican Party as the Deep state which has been it's sort of I've almost needed uh no opportunity to argue against that because as he makes the case it feels self-defeating because when he went into office he said I'm bringing in a team and we're going to take out the Deep State the implication being the Deep state were left leaning government bureaucrats and then dozens and dozens and dozens of the people he took in with him like me turned against him and said you're a bad man you are a bad bad man like actually fundamentally just a horrible person and an idiot when it comes to public policy um and a terrible president and then he's labeled them the Deep State it's a tough argument to make that you went in to detonate it with your team and then ah your team somehow got corrupted by the Deep State now I'm gonna add an asterisk to that Anthony because here's the place ironically I might agree with the former president is I think people like me made it a little bit easier for him to make that case now I ially leveled my accusations against the president anonymously and that did two things one and I still believe this one it drew a ton of public attention to those Revelations that's why I did it I I mean I was I was not stupid in doing that I did it because I know people are so attracted to a spectacle that writing those opinions anonymously would force them to get attention it was the most viral opinion piece in the history of the New York Times I got their attention but it did a second thing is it gave Trump ammunition to say look at these Cloak and Dagger people in the Deep State he was able to turn that anonymity against me and to reinforce his narrative and it's one of the reasons why at the time I said I'm eventually going to come forward and unmask myself before the election is because I was worried he would only weaponize this you know the veil was just meant to draw people's attention long enough to focus on the message instead of the messenger but if you stay in the Shadows too long you do reinforce that Narrative of you know people who are scheming and so I felt like it was important to come forward um and in and again in some ways ironically the revelations backfired and it's one of the things that I say in this book is it sounds funny coming for me but I think one of the biggest threats to our democracy is anonymity and let me explain to you what I mean it's the willingness of people to Express a strong moral view in private and be scared to do it in their own names in public and that's what got us into this mess in the Republican Party most of my peers were quote unquote Anonymous they all could have written the oped that I wrote they all felt the same way about Trump but everyone was scared shitless to do it and the consequence of that is that we elected the man and we might reelect the man because there's still so many people in the hierarchy of the Republican Party who share My Views in private but won't say them publicly and so anonymity is a danger and I learned that the hard way because ironically when I came forward anonymously and I said the president's cabinet is keeping him in check and they're you know we are restraining his worst impulses do you know what Donald Trump's response was to that he went and fired almost all of the adults in the room and I I found out much later from people like Stephanie Grisham who was his comm's director Stephanie said oh yeah he would talk about it all the time in the Oval Office everyone who walked in that door he would ask us afterwards you think that was Anonymous do you think that was Anonymous and he systematically started to essentially exterminate the adults in the room so that by the end of the first term it was a lot of Copans and so in some ways my plan backfired it actually accelerated the chaos and and that's why I think it's really important this cycle for folks not to play games don't give the off the Record quotes on how dangerous this man is come forward own it let's have a real conversation uh and be a little bit civically courageous and and it was a great personal cost to you as well losing your job in the private sector losing a relationship addiction you know there there was a there was a whole the ramifications of of speaking out were significant and we're even seeing that at the moment I mean I'm glued to the to the Select Committee hearing on on Boeing and whistleblowers at Boeing you after after those two crashes and and then a plug door blowing out and you can see the the nervousness even in the Boeing Employees who still have their jobs for fear of Retribution there you know to to to speak up in this country does require an enormous amount of strength doesn't it it requires some element of something maybe it's strength maybe it's a moment of craziness to come forward but I think it requires something more and it's not necessarily from the person who makes the disclosure it's from the rest of us and that is it's easier to go out and tell the truth if you know that other people are going to have your back by also telling the truth so put in a much more simple way cowardice is contagious but courage is also contagious and folks are more inclined to go make honest Revelations to tell the truth and speak the truth if they think it's not costly to speak the truth and I say this a lot in front of when I speak to audiences of students who are you know in college and taking econ class I I tell them look think of supply and demand Curves in any Marketplace if the price of something's really high if the cost of it is really high there's only two ways to lower the cost and right now in our country the cost of descent of speaking up it's super high yes it cost me everything so okay how do you lower that price there's only two ways econ tells us one you can either decrease the demand for something and the price goes down but we don't really want to decrease the demand for truth cuz that's kind of dumb like we don't want to live in a world of Lies so the only other way mathematically is you have to increase the supply that's the only way you get the price to go down in this case we need to increase the supply of descent and it sounds like a kindergarten lesson but it's real if in our own communities we're scared to speak up and tell the truth about the craziness in our politics well then the price of descent's going to be pretty high for the person that does they're going to go get stoned by the extremists but if everyone kind of bands together the price goes down the cost goes down it's not as hard for the next person and the next person and the next person descent to descend and I learned this through trial and error I probably tried every wrong way to do the right thing before landing on the right one and in the course of that I did learn that finally coming forward in my own name had that effect on some of my friends and peers who I was waiting to come forward it was the classic bystandard phenomenon where people are on a subway train in New York and someone's getting the kicked out of them and no one steps forward why because no one else had already stepped forward they're all waiting for each other once I made my Revelations yes did it detonate my personal life catastrophically it was choby to my personal life but then I looked to my left and my right and I had peers who had been thinking about doing the same finally ring me up on the phone and say let's do it I'm in like I'll make a video I'll come forward that was a powerful moment for me and it showed it takes a tribe of the tribess if you will uh to be able to make that more and more possible and I actually think we're breaking through I mean and I don't just mean anti-trumpers I think generally folks who are willing to disent are uh going in having people's backs and and privately I've never said this before I mean I do this when I see other people come forward not just in politics but in other situations and blow the whistle and do something tough um I often try to reach out to those folks and say hey look I'm happy to give you some private advice on look how to protect your family how to protect your friends what to do next like I've been through this but also just to say you're not you're not alone you you are in a fraternity now of people who are doing the right thing and that fraternity or sorority is getting bigger and bigger and bigger welcome don't kick yourself for having done it that's important for all of us to do when we see someone speak up even in just the workplace or the classroom so let let's shine that light on the current GOP and the way in which I mean even people like Mitch McConnell who got up after January 6 and blamed Donald Trump you know in very clear language has now endorsed him uh we've seen a few Congress people hand in their notice won't be rejoining next time bit of a cowardly way to exit stage left in my opinion but in terms of the people that have stood up to Donald Trump you can really count them on one hand obviously Liz Cheney Adam kinzinger who you know but I I I also feel like there is this um kind of cult-like mentality amongst the leadership it's not just the bass the people wearing the Maga hats but the cult-like mentality amongst the the the political leaders the Congress people the Senators so could you just talk to to those people and why is it I I mean I should just say very quickly I've been reading old Ronald Reagan speeches don't don't ask me why but I I was reading one yesterday about some remarks he made at a senate Republican Unity dinner in November 1984 and the line that really caught my eye halfway through the speech he said and I know that we Republicans will stick together as United as the union our party long ago fought to preserve is this the issue really is that that actually Republicans behind the scenes in leadership have a plan that you never criticize the leader and you you you band together no matter what well I mean look I I'll try to be fair here because I think I think all the I think both the political parties in this country have that problem um it's not as anounced an extreme at the moment on the left but you know you saw people when Nancy Pelosi was speaker sometimes you know moderates who tried to stand up against the the whatever they call them the crew the the clan the the um the squad who am I thinking of the squad the squad you know people who stood up against the squad sometimes got shot down and and there was a little bit of silencing there I mean this happens in politics politics is tribal but I think what we're seeing right now in the Republican party is without any precedent in the history of the Republic that might sound hyperbolic to some ears um you know take it from me having spent my life inside the party there ain't nothing to compare to this not even George Washington he didn't even command this level of cultish adol as Donald Trump does and you know there's something I write about in the book Anthony that um I think exemplifies this is that when Trump was President a couple of times he tweeted a pretty crazy thing he kept comparing himself weirdly to Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan and I didn't understand it at the time he you know if there was a poll about his support within the GOP you know you can go find these tweets it's like 93% of Republicans supported him and he would tweet it and he'd say I'm more popular than Reagan was in the Republican party or Lincoln leaving aside the fact that there there were no opinion polls within the Republican party of Lincoln at the time but let's just take him at his word um I thought this was crazy at the time that he kept trying to compare himself to other Republicans and I realized it was born of his insecurity but much later I realized something more significant is those claims he was making weren't absurd they were spot on he was right Donald Trump realized something that most of us conservatives didn't which is that he was commanding a different type of agulation than even a Reagan or perhaps even a Lincoln had commanded within the party because people were literally worshiping him and they still do they have they have made Trump a part of their religion I mean there are folks who've been so heavily radicalized by this man that they won't accept any Frank descriptions of things that people like I have seen about him behind the scenes they just refuse to believe it they cover their ears this man can do no wrong we didn't see the deification of Ronald Reagan like that maybe you could make an argument that that Lincoln in his you know in a in a sort of martyrdom State for the union was treated with that level of reverence um but but even then the things that we're seeing from within the party uh you can't find Historical analog for folks falling over themselves to line up behind the guy despite privately portraying a very very very different opinion of the man so I do think it's remarkable I think Trump is right in the fact that his support uh is greater in some ways than those former presidents and that's actually something for us to worry about because our Founders worried and they they wrote extensively about the danger of a demagogue assuming power in the United States and they actually tried to design the department of the executive to be somewhat resistant to that type of person and those guard rails failed we ended up electing a Donald Trump and I think now we're witnessing exactly what they had warned about and and unfortunately I'm not convinced those guard rails will be able to hold in a second term that really that last final guard rail is the electorate and if the electorate can't save us from a second Donald Trump term I will tell you nothing can the Judiciary the legislative branch they won't be able to resist the corrupt behavior that we will see Infuse the executive in a second term and I say that in in all seriousness I want to expand on that in in just a a moment and talk about who you believe Trump to be behind the scenes going to take a quick break we'll come back and do

Trump having multiple personalities aside from a personality disorder which is uh you know W widely covered although not not covered as much as I would like but there we are um tell us about from working in the administration you know the stuff that you write about in the book is compelling it's it's it's almost like a thriller the way you the book reads like a like a thriller in that way government should not work like that it's supposed to be boring it's supposed to be administrative just just talk to us about you know how Trump behaved and the things that he was stopped from doing that you describe that he will ser certainly do on his tour of Retribution if he was to win a second term well if you want if you really really really want to understand this man you have to listen to his words and take them seriously and I make a comparison here that that fellow conservatives would cry foul about but it's to Osama Bin Laden and no Donald Trump has not been Laden some ways I think he's doing more damage to American democracy um but I'm going to make the comparison because the reason we underestimated Osama Bin Laden when he was the leader of the al-Qaeda jihadist movement was because we didn't take his word seriously if you go back Bin Laden was very clear about what he wanted to do about his worldview I mean he like wrote it out in Long letters and um and and speeches that forecast all of his plans Donald Trump has done the exact same thing and he has talked about how he wants to run a second Administration as a retributive president that he wants to get revenge against his enemies that he wants to use the powers of government to go after his political enemies he he means it you need to take him seriously whether you're MAA or whether you're Progressive please take the man seriously that's what he wants to do he would like to come in and systematically rewire Federal departments and agencies to act on his behalf to advance his personal self-interest and to get retribution against his enemies if you think it's more complicated than that you don't understand Donald Trump it's that's it that's that's what he wants to do with your federal government um now you can be a conservative you can be a MAA person and hopefully look at that and say yeah you know I pay like 30 or 40% in taxes it's kind of a lot I don't like it but I definitely don't like it if I'm just paying for one guy to go in and get back at people who've pissed him off this seems like kind of a waste of my money um but that's what he wants to do in a second term now I'll give you an anecdote that I think was very revealing I was a meeting with the president the ex-president Donald Trump in the Oval Office and this was March of 2019 and we were uh having a conversation about a foreign policy excuse me about a foreign policy deal that we were trying to close with a foreign government and at the time it did not make sense to me why Donald Trump made this segue in the conversation but we're sitting there the lights in the Oval Office were turned off it was the afternoon so there's like sunlight coming in he of course is drinking a sweaty Diet Coke on the table and we're chatting and he said something to the effect of you know I learned when I was in business I learned when I was in business that when uh you know when you want something uh you know you have to actually go and get it and you know you can't uh you can't just threaten to sue someone okay like you can't just threaten because if you threaten to sue them people will say and they'll blow you off you have to just sue them whether you have a case or not and they settle like babies you know he said some version of that right and you know at the time I remember thinking this very weird but you you think back to Donald Trump's career and his disposition whether he had a case or not was to go sue his adversaries because once you sue them they face the prospect of court costs and Discovery and all these things and so they just want to settle put more simply you develop leverage over them that you didn't have before it ended up being very relevant to the conversation we were having about a foreign partner at the time but it's also how Donald Trump viewed every action in government he was on a constant quest for leverage where can I get leverage over someone else and use that leverage to get the thing that I want now that's not inherently a bad thing you know in any negotiation let's say with a foreign power yeah the United States might want leverage and use that leverage to advance its interest but this is different this is a man looking for personal leverage to get the that he personally wants and not for the country that's the Donald Trump you will see in a second term that's the person behind the scenes is a man who's constantly hunting for ways to get leverage over his enemies how will that manifest in government in a way that actually affects your everyday Americans well one of the examples I go back to that I saw a lot in homeland security was emergency response is When Donald Trump would see disaster strike around the country it's the president's job to sign these disaster declarations and send federal aid but if a disaster happened in a blue State Donald Trump saw an opportunity because he was like ah this is a place where there's a governor that doesn't like me people who didn't vote for Me Maybe I don't sign that disaster declaration or maybe I call up the governor and see if he's willing to cut me a deal that was his mindset and we saw that happen actually in several circumstances we talked him off of it but it's the type of thing that will happen in the second term he will deliver federal assistance selectively and retributively in a way that gives him leverage over his adversaries that's very weird and it's not how we expect government to operate we saw that in Puerto Rico didn't we in that terrible moment where he was throwing toilet paper at people I mean is this is does this make the point though that actually someone from the business Community does not make a great president and that you know because obviously there's that whole argument about trickle down economics and there's no proof that that it actually works but it is a conservative argument time and time again that if you deregulate business and give them those you know the the the tax breaks that eventually the The Working Man will be able to benefit I mean there's there's no proof of that but you know that that's really a lot of conservatives are still voting Republican despite Donald Trump because they think a businessman or a wealthy person in office is a good thing because wealth equates to success and that their tax uh liability might be reduced I mean how how do we get to the point where we are allowing a demagogue a dictator an autocrat potentially a second turn just because some people don't want to pay a higher rate of tax well Anthony this is where I'm going to have to uh disagree with you my friend because I would say as a conservative a great businessman makes a great president because you want some someone who's very efficient at managing a large organization and doing things that great Business Leaders do which is great Business Leaders if you if you go down to the Brass tax about what makes them effective the best in the world tend to communicate and delegate they they articulate the Strategic priorities very well and they delegate responsibility to their subordinates in a way that that carries out that Vision faithfully and with integrity and they're really really good at that but I want to go back to the beginning because great businessman makes a great president in my view Donald Trump is not a great businessman he is a failed businessman across the board Trump stakes and Trump vodka and Trump Airlines and we could go on and on um a rejoinder though might be folks say but but but no he's Rich so he must be a great businessman well Al Capone was rich Al Capone was incredibly Rich you can be rich and not be a great businessman you can be a fraud and we've seen this with Donald Trump throughout his history the man even people who've been huge supporters of his have come away saying he's a total fraud he he swindled me in this business deal or that business deal so I I do still think great businessmen can make great presidents but he is not one and in fact all the characteristics that made him a failed businessman he took into the White House and in a lot of ways he made the US government his largest failed Venture yet he rendered so many departments and agency effectively incapable of discharging their duties because of his volatility and his corrupt nature I saw it in our own Department it was supposed to be my job to support the work of the 250,000 men and women under me at the Department of Homeland Security but instead because the president was so impulsive I had to spend all of my time focused on one person had to spend my time focused on how do we manage the president that's not the sign a good businessman he's clearly not communicating and delegating really well that's the sign of the exact opposite and and that's just how he governed in a first term with those quote unquote guard rails in place I think it would be uh a great deal worse in in a second term um and I and I wouldn't think that I don't think Business Leaders should get too excited about a trump second term being better for them economically than than a Biden term and I hear this argument from from Wall Street execs and Wall Street B billionaires that well it'll be better under Trump than it has been under Biden if there's one thing that matters to American businesses it's stability it's consistency it's why we live in a Land of laws it's why the rule of law is good for economies and democracies and for human flourishing a second Donald Trump term will be so volatile from our relations with the world to domestic policy to the stability of the executive branch itself that I think it will be very dangerous and destabilizing for American businesses and American Trade I think it's important for conservatives to know that talk to me uh with your expertise in National Security about the security threat of Donald Trump because you know we we often talk about the security clearances that that you know in the real world he would never have been able to achieve let alone Jared Kushner and a whole bunch of people that worked in the White House at a senior level talking about you know his his um AIDS and surrogates you know there is a real security issue here isn't there and and in fact the fact that he now has a publicly Trading Company with with shares that people can buy which he uses you know in his own Spiel to try and artificially inflate the value of I mean anybody could buy those shares and try to Curry favor with a a future president that combined with you know his history of stealing classified documents and sharing the information as he did famously with an Australian businessman I mean that does not make for for a safe Nation especially a nation like the United States which really kind of should celebrate its Safety and Security well I I'll actually go back to the comment I made about leverage because if Donald Trump operates in a manner that's focused on finding leverage over his enemies then he should know that America's adversaries operate very much the same way way and that's no coincidence autocrats operate like other autocrats so whether it's China or Russia or Iran or North Korea that's how they end up corrupting Western figures and officials and collecting intelligence is they attempt to develop leverage over them whether it's compromising material whether it's taking on their financial debt this is actually why when you're someone like me and you start your career as a government bureaucrat you fill out this form called The sf86 Standard form 886 and it's all of this information very personal information about your life and you have to fill out that form to start the security clearance process to either get a secret or a top secret security clearance and that form asks about your finances your family your friends any foreign Nationals you know and you do that because over decades and decades we have learned there are tried and true tactics for our adversaries and it's if they can get that financial leverage over you or penetrate your circle they can get you they can squeeze you and they can get you to share classified information now folks might be surprised to learn that the president of the United States doesn't have to fill out an sf86 why well because the Constitution doesn't say you know when they win the majority of the electoral college now they must fill out form you know standard form you know 86 and so you have a person who ends up ascending to the highest office in the land who's got access to the most sensitive information of the federal government who actually hasn't gone through that sort of vetting Donald Trump is not required in anywhere under us law nor any president to disclose all of his financial dealings to disclose his foreign contacts um now a lot of people do as a matter of course when they get elected but Donald Trump could win this presidency again and this is a hypothetical but you know it could be that uh Vladimir Putin has found a way to bail out his companies or to do other things to engra himself to Donald Trump and we the American people might not know why does that matter because then Donald Trump goes into the White House and doesn't want to do anything to piss off that foreign adversary that either has helped him or that could potentially hurt him this is very real this happens every year in the National Security Community with people at sort of a mid- level and we know foreign governments are targeting Donald Trump because they consider him susceptable to influence that's been Declassified that should really alarm everyone and I'll tell you we saw it in his administration we would get nervous about him dealing with foreign governments because it was so easy for Donald Trump to get played it really was I mean he was so susceptible to flattery and getting played and you saw these foreign leaders learned in the first few months that's all you had to do because You' get on these phone calls or read these transcripts of foreign leaders talking to Donald Trump and they realize oh literally all I have to do is blow smoke up as you know up his ass and and we'll win him over and it worked you know he was very susceptible to those things so there is a national security concern here a bigger thing Anthony and I'm happy to get into it will just be all the different ways he intends to use the security services of the US federal government corruptly for his own benefit that to me is also a national security threat to have the intelligence Community serving the president's personal whims rather than monitoring threats to the American people I want to talk about that next especially when it comes to voting one of the things I've been saying is that you know if you vote for Donald Trump this time you may never get to vote again so we'll talk about the you know the the details of that in in just

presidency is not just about Democrats being sad losers it's about a threat to the bigger picture the the Safety and Security of the nation as a whole it's a vote between democracy with with Joe Biden and demagoguery or dictatorship under Donald Trump he's even admitted it I mean that's what's so frightening about this he and and we're at a point now where there are Trump supporters considering a dictator and saying well maybe that is what we need after all all my my concern is is the vote and how Donald Trump you know with his fake elector scheme that didn't work last time so he sent the mob into the capital that didn't work in the end he really wants ultimate control he's talked as Vladimir Putin does about you know being president forever just talk to me about with with the benefit of your expertise about your fears going into a second Trump presidency regarding democracy and the loss of it I will say Anthony it's one of the reasons that I felt compelled to write blowback and and and I suspect a lot of your listeners have the same view as me and I would urge them you know they may not need to read the message this is something you should be sharing with friends or family members who think Donald Trump is going to operate a second term in some even keeled way or that maybe he's learned enough from the the first term to operate in a more sober-minded fashion that's not the case and you know you know they don't have to take my word for it I try to quote as many of these people as possible in the book that had served in that Administration along with me uh as possible by name to describe what they predict will happen in a second term the things that he wanted to do that he wasn't able to accomplish so specifically what does some of that look like you can go Department by Department in the federal government and see some pretty frightening things that Trump would do in a second term let me give you one example I spoke to several people who ran the Department of Veterans Affairs under Donald Trump people who were his Deputy secretaries The General Counsel folks that were appointed by Trump in the White House to run that department and I actually didn't think I was going to find anything there um I it was kind of a box checking exercise I wanted to talk to senior leaders of every Department of agency under Trump and I was like okay Veterans Affairs I don't remember a lot of controversies there were a few small ones and I went and spoke to them and they said oh yeah I mean in the second term he's going to totally detonate the department I was like what do you mean detonate the department it's the department of you know Veterans Affairs it gives benefits to people who've served our country in uniform they said yeah well he hated veterans he called them lazy malingerers that was a quote from one of the senior officials from Veterans Affairs and they said he viewed it like a piggy bank because Donald Trump learned early in his administration he had more flexibility with the budget and the programs in the Department of Veterans Affairs than other departments and so what he wanted to do was to upend the Department of Veterans Affairs and spend all that money on other things things that were his priorities things that Donald Trump felt like were more important than military veterans and he sort of ruly put those plans on a shelf when his advisers warned him that if he nuked the Department of Veterans Affairs before his reelection he would lose because don't touch America's military veterans and so again his own people said yeah I mean we convinced him to pause but in the second term he's going to take a wrecking ball to the VA because he wants to send that money to other projects I mean he wanted to take VA money and go build the border wall with it you could want to build a border wall but I think most people wouldn't want to build it on the backs of Disabled American Veterans that's the type of really cynical stuff that his own people are predicting he'll do in a second term but it goes much deeper than that and it gets much weirder than that because I went and did another box checking exercise and talked to Executives from the Department of Education under Trump and I thought I don't know what what are Department of Ed people going to tell me um it can't have been that bad over there and when Betsy DeVos was secretary Donald Trump and stevenh Miller wanted her to issue an order saying that students who were the children of illegal immigrants in public schools should be kicked out of public school because we shouldn't provide free education to the children of illegals now they ended up pushing back on that saying that we would get sued in the courts they turned it around the the staff at the time under Betsy devance but those same staff members told me oh no no in the second term they're going to bring that executive order back and they're going to do it themselves imagine being a person who feels so angry towards immigrants to this country that you want to go kick their little third and fourth grade children out of American schools as a means of punishing them that's pretty sick stuff I want I want a more secure border than we currently have but I'm not going to go punish children to make it happen those are the types of things you could see in a second term to say nothing of what would happen in the National Security departments and agencies had a lot of people under Trump tell me he'll use the wiretapping powers of the intelligence Community to go after his adversaries and you would think that's impossible uh there's too many layers between the president and those authorities well towards the end of his administration tried to stack the intelligence Community with loyalists who would have been willing to carry out egregious orders along those lines and certainly that's their intent in a second term and in the department that I was helping to run the Department of Homeland Security Trump regularly wanted to go deploy DHS forces almost like a private militia to carry out his will and we often said no to that but even after I left you saw him do this in Portland where he ordered the deployment of counterterrorism forces that work within DHS for the first time in history on US city streets to go put down um you know uh rallies and and protests that will be put on steroids in a second term and you will see these things happen not as isolated incidents but as standard US government policy yeah that was very frightening I I talked to that a lot we didn't know who those military people were they they were unmarked they were using unmarked vehicles and they were disappearing people off the streets and you know that is the stuff that we would expect out of out of Russia or or North Korea but but not the United States I mean these were American citizens that were were being disappeared finally I just want to look at a phrase that we hear from a lot of uh Republicans and potential Trump voters and that is well when Trump was President there was no war and this is something that Trump uses himself and obviously now we're in you know there is a much more um complex International situation than than ever before both with Ukraine but also with Gaza Trump is obviously denying having any involvement with this despite really destabilizing much of the Middle East during his presidency could you just talk to those people who claim that you know a trump presidency brings no war versus Joe Biden having to clean up Trump's mess my message to those people right now in all sincerity would be the reason that there was not a catastrophic global conflict during the Donald Trump presidency was not because of Donald Trump it was despite Donald Trump and let me tell you what I mean I think if it were not for courageous people like my former boss John Kelly Former Defense secretary Jim Mattis to a certain extent Rex Tillerson and others there's quite a Mark Millie there's quite a high likelihood that the United States would have been thrust into extraordinary conflict during the Trump presidency because of things he wanted to do and even more specifically than that I want to point to North Korea because the way that the president was handling North Korea at the time so concerned all of us in his National Security cabinet that for the first time in the history of the Department of Homeland Security in the United States we had to hold private exercises to assess what would happen if Trump accidentally got us into a nuclear war and there was a nuclear strike on the US Homeland to my knowledge and I ran this by the Department of Homeland Security when I was publishing this book there was no other circumstance since the Department's been created where DHS had to do real life nuclear war planning because the president was putting us in such a volatile position so if you think Trump kept us out of Wars what I'm telling you is I'm not trying to say miles kept us out of Wars but a lot of good people around Donald Trump prevented him from making decisions and taking actions that could have got us into the most dangerous conflict we've ever been in in the modern history of the Republic up to potentially and including World War II I mean the guy was playing with fire when it came to nuclear weapons and we were really really worried about it and I will tell you I can't divulge the details of those nuclear response planning exercises but they were not good and I will tell folks who think that we can survive a second Donald Trump term without getting into one of those conflicts you haven't seen what I've seen on the other side of the wall of how terrifying that could actually be and the man does not have the discipline to avoid getting us in those situations and he certainly will not bring in a team that Reigns him in from making those impulsive decisions that could spiral into catastrophic conflict that's how bad this could actually get and I will tell you on top of that uh this was something else that I got to reveal for the first time in blowback is the department gave me permission to write a little bit about something that is privately referred to as the Doomsday Book so there's a book inside the White House of break glass in case of emergency powers that the president of the United States allegedly has in the instance that the United States gets invaded or struck by nuclear weapon or goes to war those Powers allow the president to do some pretty extraordinary things to protect the country however in the wrong hands those authorities could be misused to do some pretty terrible things to exert control over the United States at the end of the Trump Administration there was a frenetic effort to keep that book out of the president's hands because people were worried that Trump would use those powers to keep the government from being transferred over to Joe Biden and it very nearly ended up in the wrong hands of a of a Maga sycophant who almost got installed in the job overseeing the security of the Doomsday Book I'm very worried that in a second term Donald Trump the the crown jewels aren't going to be safe from him he will go and access those tools and authorities but not to protect the United States but to wield influence over the American people in a way that is uh by some definitions quite clearly unconstitutional anti-constitutional and and and that's that's a fear so I do expect there would be vastly greater geopolitical disorder in a second Trump Administration as he pulls away from our Western allies and tries to get America to uh cozy up to its enemies but also as Donald Trump tries to use some of those extraordinary foreign and defense Powers uh here domestically it's a terrifying thought he very finally he's not doing it alone is he we have the Heritage Foundation with project 2025 we have Steve Bannon and various characters who really are going to help Trump this time around and by removing anybody such as yourself from the administration who could stop him that is the differential this time isn't it that that last time there were people in place like Mark Millie as you describe this time he won't have those people around that's absolutely right and you know I always go back to the words of these people uh Stephen Miller had told me personally that a second term would be a quote shock and awe Blitz that was his comment is there would be a flurry of extraordinary executive orders when Trump took office and you know Steve Bannon himself said that they would bring in the next generation of Assassins that's how he described the people that would come in I don't think anyone would say that Jim Madison John Kelly and Mark Millie you know came in to be Trump's Assassins but that's who he wants to put in those jobs is people who will as this as the phrase suggests essentially kill for the president in some cases that might be all too literally that's how serious this is and um I I think we have to view it with you know through that cleare eyed lens in order to actually prevent it okay we have to finish but um thank thank you for your for being so candid and also for your for your bravery and congratulations on the book well I appreciate Anthony and and like we said at the beginning um you know we're going to award a Lamborghini to someone it looks like Sue colleti in Kansas Sue congratulations you won a Lamborghini from Midas Touch so really excited to
