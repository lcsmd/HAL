  "transcript": "the only way we're going to really save science from being so [\u00a0__\u00a0] right now is if we create more spaces and more funding vehicles for more anarchy [Applause] all right what's up everybody this is other life i am justin murphy i just wanted to let you know that i write a free newsletter to thousands of people every week it's where i publish my best work i share events that you can come to and much more we have an insane private community around the newsletter and it's free go check it out just go to otherlife.com that's otherlife.co when you subscribe i'm going to send you a folder of pdfs that contain all of my personal highlights from a bunch of my favorite books that i've read over the years so you'll get a million insights after just a few minutes of browsing these pdfs really they're really special to me and i just figured i'd share them with you all so that's otherlife.comlife.co all right reva so i think a lot of people in my audience will know a thing or two about you at least vaguely it seems like you've had a lot of success in different domains you've run your own business you've had important positions at other big businesses it seems like you're uniquely talented at being able to just go from one thing to the next you also run your mouth like crazy and seem to get away with it is there something unique that you think or do that has allowed you to have this kind of wild career and yet still be successful well i think first we have to define successful because lots of things i've worked on have not worked right like actually if i look back at my career the most successful thing i ever did was build a children's toy shop and that's not the thing that i'm the most well known for but if i look back with hindsight now that was the one that really um i think potentially brought the most value to the world um but yeah i know i've definitely jumped around like i went into tech and startups and ventured capital and i went to work at intel and then you know now i'm thinking about neuroscience and um yeah people do ask me that a lot they also just try and figure out if i'm a spy because i just like how do you jump around all these different places you must be an intelligence agent and i've always been offended by that because i'm like the people who actually read my text messages who could employ me to be a spy must know that i'm not smart enough because no one's ever actually asked me to be a spy um but no i think well i wrote about this once like imagine having one life and just being like one thing like it's just so insane to me like this i always wanted to do so many different things and i could never imagine having one career that laughs lost my entire life i have so many interests i think the one of the ways i've been able to jump around is and i've i've said this before is like what i think is the most beneficial kind of networking and business strategy is it's literally just having integrity it's like if i go into something say i want to go into venture capital or i want to go into uh you know work at intel or you know get hired by jim keller or any of these things like i'm i try to be very honest about what i know and what i don't know i think it's very valuable it's like i'm going into semiconductors thinking that i have like a extensive background in silicon engineering um but i have like a passion to learn and i like know what my skill sets are so when i find a new interest like for instance now this neuroscience stuff like i'm not going to be the person doing the research but i understand my skills and catalyzing the research that i find um so just being aware of my own skill set and then just being really curious like asking good questions um people who are experts in fields like like it when you go out like you've done some research into that area and then you ask some good valid questions and i think that's kind of like if you look at what elon musk has done with his career like he's jumped into all these different spaces and he kind of in my idea like he figures out the mechanics of a space right and then he figures out these kind of catalyst leverage points where he can go use his skill set to do something with it and on a very like much much [\u00a0__\u00a0] level i'm like trying to do the same but i mean just for context half the stuff i've done is like failed so interesting so you know it looks like your your life has been successful it seems like you have money uh it seems like you're doing quite well so if a lot of things you do fail how do you manage to do well anyway well if we it matters how you think about failure like i don't think about failure is like oh no it's bad i think if failure is like a data point for you to improve your model in the world to know how to advance next like i set up a venture capital fund or i try to like 24. it was so i was so ridiculously naive um and you know i had such gumption i was like i'm going to raise a 50 million venture fund to invest in ai startups to accelerate science and um i look back at it now and my model was just off of the world right and then afterwards when things didn't work out the way i wanted it to do i learned a lot of things then i incorporated that into my next stuff so i was like okay well i now know that i never want to manage other people's money so if i have to manage other people's money it's actually that's like your main role as a venture capitalist is not what i want to do i want to deliver capital to projects that i care about so i learned i was like okay well i actually don't want to work in venture capital i'd rather make money separately and make angel investments so the failure of my venture fund wasn't like a it wasn't like a you know huge barrier in my life it was just uh it i used that as a as a as a thing to just learn from um okay gotcha and so you so you so you go to someone like jim keller at intel and you're like hey i want to get a job hire me uh what does that pitch look like that's definitely not what happened i was never like i want to go work intel jim keller is a genius and one of like the best mentor i've ever had in my entire life um he's one of my favorite people in the whole wide world and when he was leaving tess i met him through my venture fund when he was leaving tesla to go work at intel he said why don't you come work and i was like what am i going to do with intel like i'll get fired right and he made a bet with me that if i lasted more than three months he'd reckon i'd be ceo in like two years so my three month anniversary i was like damn i guess you work for me now but i got seven 17 hr complaints in 18 months like i'm like not used for the corporate life um but i the reason why i went to work at intel was i was like one i am interested in silicon engineering but two i was like i'll learn a lot from gym right like how to manage a team it's 11 000 employees with like a several billion dollar annual budget to have that experience working directly under someone that i respect that much is not something i would ever turn down um so yeah that that's how i ended up i ended up doing that i wanted the opportunity opportunity to learn from but if your experience was mostly running a toy store and having a failed uh venture capital firm how do you make yourself seem like viable for that well i guess we have to ask him that but uh no when the first time i met jim he was uh the head of hardware at tesla and i was doing my venture fund and i came and um we just started chatting and then we just got on like he's such a broad generalist he's very philosophical and he had all these cross interests and the way that his mind works and my mind was like it would push each other in the right way to think about things and um you know i've had a bunch of people in my life just like recognize some skills i think i've spent a lot of my time thinking about epistemology so i try and think about how i formulate my beliefs and my arguments and if you think about thinking a lot i think that maybe other people who think about thinking a lot recognize that right so jim's like it doesn't matter that you don't have all the semiconductor knowledge right we're going to put you a strategy in the silicon engineering team the fact that you don't have the biases of the industry is probably extremely valuable because you'll come in and maybe you'll spot stuff and see things so it's more about that so the way that i think that like people that have you know bonded with me or helped me with my careers it's the it's it's people who think think a lot about thinking um and then when i was at intel like i didn't sit and work on silicon engine engineering designs it's a you know at a team that big it's a lot of like politics and strategy and trying to figure out how to make things work um and yeah just like trying to find random leverage points to uh you know accelerate silicon engineering design and like you know i do have some technical knowledge from like being involved in the ai space for a while so it was cool to bring that over um but i remember my first day at intel because jim just sent me like a silicon design workshop like i had no idea what was going on and i thought oh no he thinks i like know all this stuff and then laughed and he thought you know i just wanted to throw you and i was like no i actually loved it okay nice nice i love it so basically have integrity and think a lot about thinking and if you if you can really just be a really smart reflective person with high integrity you can kind of get yourself into all kinds of big positions even if you fail a lot that doesn't really matter yeah i actually really value people who failed in the past because like if you haven't failed on some things that you've done i mean my venture fund was like i had such a plan right i was gonna do this venture fund use it to invest in ai to accelerate scientific discovery then accelerate science would accelerate my own lifespan like i had this whole plan and when it didn't work it's like it's like good right because i learned my own naivety on like that my moral of the world was just so shallow and you understand the complexities of like how industries actually really work and when you get to that when you understand how complex systems are it's going to make you better in like doing everything else i know that you're a big fan of the philosopher's science fire event recently at a party you gave a copy of uh his book against method to everyone at the party i would love to learn what was the most important lesson you learned from firebend so i read um i've been interested in like how to accelerate science for like a long time and that was the purpose of our venture fund when i originally set it up was that we wanted to invest in ai to accelerate research and discovery um so like cloud labs and stuff like this but uh i read fair and i did do some of this at university because i did do philosophy of science as part of my philosophy degree and i read firearm and then but it's like there are some books where you have to read books at the right time so i read it at the time didn't have a huge effect on me i read it again a few years ago i think like 2019 i tweeted about it and i was like wow this one of the things i love is that my i've gone through this kind of uh uh flow of my trying to understand where the problems are in in like why science isn't doesn't at least seem to be as interesting as it was in the early 20 or you know at least like 50 60 years ago is that i my naivete when i started my venture fund was that i thought that the block to scientific progress was actually funding i was like if i just get more money to projects and i remember peter thiel saying to me once if there were lots of cool projects i would just be funding them and i was like he's just cynical there's going to be loads but like no he had a point right they didn't they didn't exist right and then i'm like okay well what actually is the problem and then if you go look at scientific research which is the thing that fair album points out it's so linear right it's like you scientific castle like scientific research especially in academia has to like plod along from like the last stage like you look at like the cunyan structure of science it's like you have these different stages of scientific research and like it's meant to follow on and the way that universities are set up is like you get a phd you follow up from your peers you're meant to advance on their discoveries but if you look at the really amazing like paradigm shifts in science like galileo couldn't have been peer-reviewed right it's ridiculous um and the the real shifts in science have come from like anarchism right from someone who's gone there is this dogmatic view this dogmatic assumption of how the world works and we've got this new point that makes it it's not going to fit into the previous paradigm and fair i've been saying that we need more epistemological anarchism in science because if you look at the greatest achievements in science they have come from people who've kind of refuted the current paradigm and um and i think we've really come to like ahead i think one of the reasons why it was so good for me it was actually jim who told me to read fair album again like six months ago and we organized the event we gave everyone the copies of that book but he told me to read it again because i think during covert i definitely went even i became even more skeptical about the belief like the like the epistemology of science right and then i reread fair oven and i was like it's so true like we have people just subscribing to dogma all the time so one of the things that's so great about therap and i recommend anyone to read it because it's not just about science it's like how do you have breakthrough thoughts you have to just allow for anarchy in your mind like allow for that space and he gives examples and one of them i do all the time which is if you're trying to build an assumption or something or build an argument just to force yourself to bring in something that's completely surreal so if you're trying to build a model of physics like bring in something like you say to yourself your argument has to also fit into like parapsychology or like psychic energy or like scientology or something just so it forces you to think differently because it puts you in a different mindset um so yeah it's just a really valuable book and i think the only way we're going to really save science from being so [\u00a0__\u00a0] right now is if we create more spaces and more funding vehicles for people to have to be more you know for more anarchy basically love it love it yeah totally so i want to ask you about something specific uh fireband once wrote that major scientific discoveries are not like the discovery of america where the general nature of the discovered object is already known rather they are like recognizing that one has been dreaming if this is true what commonly held belief i'm asking you is really just a false dream that we're going to wake up from soon oh i mean i have a lot but one that i'm one one of my biggest uh kind of changes of something that i used to believe that yeah i've really updated on now is um i don't think the brain produces consciousness like it's just so ridiculous i think that you know and it's not like i have a fun model they lost people have lots of different arguments but my current working view is uh you know it's more like the brain is more like an antenna and that there is a lot like there's a lot like outside this consciousness like it's just people it blows people's minds if you tell them that all observable reality is less than five percent of what's in the universe and like the rest of it is like the supposed like dark energy and dark matter like we don't have any idea the idea that we can be arrogant in science is so insane the bright their brain produces consciousness and the neurons i'm just like where like this makes any sense um and yeah and then like and like the psychic like some of the the psychic phenomenon i used to think this stuff was [\u00a0__\u00a0] and one of the reasons why i think this stuff was [\u00a0__\u00a0] in the past is because it gets wrapped under like this like a lot of spirituality stuff which i don't like because i think it's like not into this like stoicism like this make ourselves like weak and all this stuff so like i've kind of avoided all this all these things but for instance i'm reading right now ben gertzel who's actually a great ai well big ai engineer um he wrote a book called empirical evidence for psy and if you look at the psych experiments they're more statistically significant than a lot of the stuff that we take for assumptions for instance people take aspirin to reduce you know the risk of heart disease the psychic like if you do look at gans build experiments all this stuff they're more they're more specifically significant that there's evidence that this stuff works than like aspirin for heart disease right but it's so outside of people's uh scope of thoughts because we name it things like parapsychology which means outside of normal psychology i'm like right [\u00a0__\u00a0] it's normal psychology normal psychology is like made up belief narratives right so that's my i think i i think one of the biggest shifts will come it's also you know why i'm skeptical about ai when i'm scheduled about neuroscience is that we are the fundamental way that we think about consciousness seems to me to be completely incorrect okay fascinating so you think the brain might just be an antenna that's not the location of consciousness and you also think that these fields that are sometimes denigrated with less than flattering term you know terms and descriptors like power psychology you think there's there's more there than uh most people would suspect yeah and you know what's insane is that once you start i mean this sounds like a catch-22 because people say well if you believe it then you'll see it right but once you start getting into the mindset and also like understanding the power of your mind like i don't know like it's like cool i've seen people do incredible things and i actually you know people say like if this stuff was real people really could have these psychic skills or you know have this ability to do things why aren't they doing more powerful things and the more i meet more powerful people the more i realize they have these skills they just don't tell people okay fascinating well there this is now kind of a popular meme in certain circles ideas around you know esoteric things and the occult and uh this kind of stuff actually although it's it's still kind of low status in high education kind of scientific circles the if you look at the masses on the internet there's huge huge communities of people interested in things like magic and black magic and it gets pretty wild actually so it sounds like you actually put some possible credence on the fact that maybe really powerful people out there are actually engaging in magic or how do you think about it what would you call it i just think they they've they know how to do things with their minds that other people they're more aware of how powerful the mind is like if you think about like the last hundred years of psychology we've kind of reduced the mind to be this like the the way we've made we're so materialist now that we've separated the mind from physics right like there's physics and there's like our minds like somehow they don't interlink right and the way i think about physics now is that um you know who knows what this like dark energy dark matter is like i think a lot of it might be that it's there's somewhat to do with this word consciousness which i think will eventually disappear when we have better models for these things but if you think about like quantum physics right if you observe things and things can change and it's like there's already a lot of evidence that minds can change physical reality and i think the people who are very tapped into that they understand a lot about the power of intention and when i used to hear about this stuff when i was younger i was like that's so stupid like you obviously can't do this because science has been so reductionist in the last 100 years and then when you start to do it yourself right um like i've just seen like even in my own anecdotal experience i've been able to do like insane things in the last year just having being more aware of how my mind can interact with physical reality wow okay so i'm not saying like maturity what's an example okay i'll give you i'll give you one my cousin died a year ago and on the night when he was he died i i woke up in like 3 a.m and i had a panic attack like i don't have panic attacks i'm not a very anxious person and like my heart was like i was like having this insane palpitations and i texted my friend and i was like i'm having like a heart attack um and she's like just calm down and you'll be fine and the next morning i woke up and i was like your cousin has died from a heart attack right and i was like okay that's strange but i kind of put that to one side two weeks ago same thing happened to me i was in my friend's house and i couldn't sleep i was like convulsing and i was just thinking myself someone someone i know i love is dying right now i can just tell and i woke up in the morning and my cousin tells me saying your aunt died of a heart attack last night and you know when people say this stuff you know they get they like have these premonitions or they have it it's like it makes sense to me now that there's i think of like consciousness more of like an intention network where there are ways in which people are connected um so like those two things are examples to me and they've been very harrowing i've only had two panic attacks in the last two years and they've both been with people in my family had heart attacks right wow so that's one another thing is um you know simple things like setting intention like my my my friend jesse who you're talking about who has who has that podcast american alchemy his aunt is a therapist she said to me like yo you should mood board and i was like what am i like an old lady on pinterest like i'm not like a food boarder and i made a mood board randomly last summer and i put some thought into it and i looked at it again like a month ago and it is insane it is insane how much of the things that i put in the mood more like really specific details became real like it's so strange i believe a lot in intention now i'm only starting to unders undergo but like some of the people who run the biggest most successful hedge funds that i know i mean they really harness the power of intention wow not rich that's fascinating those are really interesting examples well i might have to build a startup all about you know uh harnessing mental power to change physics and you can lead the seed round maybe yeah i mean actually i ironically have just invested in a group that's doing that okay cool i'll look out for that maybe we talk a little bit about crypto obviously really interesting and important at the moment uh there was a recent essay that you wrote that seemed to suggest that perhaps the blockchain revolution might just end up with former obama interns pacifying the population with ubi tokens i'm curious is that your mental model of how crypto unfolds or is crypto possibly going to be this kind of massive tsunami tsunami that kind of overthrows the entire fraudulent boomer elite and liberates life as we know it well they can only rule us because they rule our currency right so um you know the thing that excites me the most about crypto is exactly that it's it's not even about overthrowing boomer elites it's just it's bypassing them right it's like you can't control us if we don't care about your currency like i mean 99 of my money is a crypto like i have very little faith in the short term and long-term future of the u.s like not right and if they don't have if the federal reserve doesn't have the stronghold the state is only powerful because of the dollar right so for me it's not you know i used to think that it would like we'd have this revolution and it might be this like crazy you know like shift i used to be much more cynical that it would be like very very bad and now the way i'm seeing is uh the boomerang are just ruining their currency and everyone's economic situation anyway because there's so short-termism about it right they're just trying to stay in power and the young people are being radicalized not because they're going to learn about the federal reserve like i spent a bunch of time when i was at university studying austrian economics like i come from this mindset of being like you know like [\u00a0__\u00a0] that like all of this stuff um but the young people like they don't even need to they're not really mises or like you know they they don't need to go in and learn that they're becoming austrian economic economists just by nature because they're seeing what's happening a little bit but i am i am actually very uh um heartened by how a political crypto is not like everyone's like you know we care about republicans and democrats are just like we have these tools and we want these tools and galen from urban has this amazing quote which is give people the tools and let them organize themselves how can the us government provided infrastructure for 330 million people it's so ridiculous you could without the internet when people didn't know about what else was going on in the world but the cool thing about crypto is that we want to give people the tools to self-organize into whatever structures that they want like i i imagine a future where we can have like city dows and you know different economy if people want to experiment with different economic systems they should be allowed um so i think he's just going to bypass it like i think that the state is going to become like what happened with the catholic church the catholic church at one point told us everybody wants to do right and and so now we can't imagine a world but like we didn't we don't really imagine like the state doesn't have a stronghold on us but as their power and the dollar and the younger generation comes up i think they're just going to become weaker and weaker and weaker until it's going to kind of be like the uk monarchy right it's like i don't really care what the queen says on a day-to-day basis like she can't execute me anymore um but the young like what we don't care what elizabeth warren says you know like who cares and uh and i find that i'm very excited by that i'm very excited right on yeah totally well i mean you know blockchains and smart contracts kind of are govern governments in a way they are kind of replacement govern governmental technology so i see where you're going with that so i guess you're not as bearish on the social outcomes as you possibly once were uh the idea of this be possibly becoming kind of co-opted or controlled by the elites you're not worried about that so much i think well that article was kind of like i saw donate commentary after the 2020 election and the reason why i was writing that was that i was like this the original title of that article which was meant to go into spectators that they didn't allow me to print it was that the road that progresses were taking us down so the idea was like if we keep going down this route this is what it's going to look like so that was the context of that piece it's not what i want to happen um you know i think there's one in the article i was like you know you have to cross the you have to cross that you have to you go on the ark across climate change like kamala harris and aoc are there like just checking if you ever recycle you know i was like imagining this dystopian future um but you know the i mean a little crypto stuff which i find extremely cringe but at the same time it's like you know i i came into this stuff you know my you know somewhat libertarian in nature because i had such negative experiences with the state at such a young age from going through the welfare system with my mother um that it you know very much radicalized me but it's like the thing is like even the stuff that i find cringe like there was this big party in vegas last weekend like this after party nft event and i was like i'm gonna go like i don't care because it's gonna bring more adoption to the space like i used to be a bit more like no it should all be people like understand austrian economics i thought that's like no like i just want there to be a lot of adoption because they're not going to care like people don't care about politics or philosophy if you want widespread adoption of crypto we've got to hook people in with status and you know things that play to the things that they already want and it'll only serve me as someone who thinks about it more philosophically in the long run right yeah totally i hear all of that and i think you own a crypto pancake right so do you think that there are going to be these kind of high visibility marquee brands if you will that retain value over the long term like are crypto punks going to be super valuable in 10 years 20 years 100 years is that what you think or what uh why is it well i bought i mean i have a bunch of uh of nfcs i'm you know i not loads i i i actually in the whole cryptos stuff like i haven't got even though i have a cryptocurrency terms and stuff like i definitely am not following nf nfts that deeply it's just not something i'm like as philosophically interested plus i've been not been very online for the last year which has been the real nft time but i bought i bought the crypto punk um i think that project is cool there's something about it being like at least somewhat og in the in the nft state also i just liked it because like we were in monty my ex-boyfriend i were in monte carlo and i was like smoking a cigarette on the terrace and it's like crypto punk came up they like looked exactly like me and i was just like yeah we just buy this and like kind of stone we thought it was funny so it wasn't like some like philosophical idea okay um and i bought the toads because i thought they were funny too but i also bought like the funks you know ryder rex's project which like everyone like you know aggressively thinks is negative to crystal palace like i just on that stuff i'm i'm um you know at the core of it i'm still like a 13 year old reddit boy in terms of taste um so yeah it wasn't some deep philosophical stuff like squiggle down and stuff when it's like 800 000 for a squiggle like you really lost me that i just i can't right right what about milady do you own him a lady i mean i you know i just i i've i've been so offline and then like the the the tyro guys uh uh killed me on the milady stuff and yeah there was it remained from alia the website i was like this is cool i mean this is got a bit more of like the cyberpunk mentality which i really appreciate um like all this kind of nft people like raising venture funds i'm like it's kind of lame yeah something spirit of crypto right like um but again for the sake of long time adoption i don't mind like i you know it's it's i become less um uh i've been become less binary on like having to be like a philosophical fit right right okay interesting very interesting perspective on on nfts uh you mentioned or i mentioned uh milady's so the remedia collective is on urban that kind of brings us to another topic i wanted to ask you about um what do you think is the most what what is the currently the most interesting and exciting emerging emerging technology and why is it orbit well i you know you're saying this is the right person because i am on an advisor for urban i have been since 2015. i think it's like me and jerry crew from pantera maybe a couple of others um but the reason why i got interested in urban in the first place was one of the same reasons why i actually got just an orga which is if you look at crypto there aren't many things actually there are not many people actually trying to build decentralized products right um not philosophically and not technically either um and if you're building like a somewhat decentralized product on a centralized stack i mean it's not very ambitious and it's in a in a future which is growing seems to be going towards more censorship it's not censorship resistant either and the genius of curtis jarvin is that he picks up very early like he started building early like 12 13 years ago like a long time ago um and i think it's because he's like one of the first people to experience censorship so he realized that we've got to think about this very philosophically and the thing about urban is you won't people won't they don't they don't get it until they need it and i think i think you know people go like why do you need a decentralized slack why would you decentralize chat and it's because we're going towards needing these things like maybe the current stuff isn't you know too bad that people want to make people move over and you know urban has its own issues in terms of like ux and stuff to handle to like be more user-friendly and they're working on that but philosophically they've built something genuinely censorship resistant and they thought about it like all the way down like right you know they built their own operating system like that is a huge you know technical feat um so the only truly decentralized project in my mind i mean there's probably others but like that thought about at that level is urban so if you care about crypto you should want urban to succeed because if we're going like who knows what happens in the midterms and 2024 like you know like twitter twitter like i've been suspended off twitter twice with such [\u00a0__\u00a0] we might really really need of it like we i also think we might really really need auger um because they are truly people trying to think about you know decentralized production art markets and decentralized you know a social suite decentralized tools what what is the name of the group you were just saying orga i i i'm not familiar yeah auger was cool because it was like a very it was like the first ico with the first ethereum ico that was really decentralized projection markets so doing like betting and gambling and like joey kruger was my old roommate at the time my ex-boyfriend also got there so like i got you know one of the reasons why i found orga very interesting it's an overlap i think people who like both auger and other was that you know prediction markets and gambling like the there are already stuff that i mean it's weird for me because gambling's not illegal in in the uk but it's illegal here like i'm like why can't i just bet on [\u00a0__\u00a0] oh yeah you're saying you're saying auger sorry you know i actually lived in britain for i lived in britain for five years you know but i still can't hear certain things sorry about that no no it's all right yeah yeah right yes okay so you know you you in england you can gamble and i don't gamble like actually ironically because i am in vegas right now but i'm not a huge gambler but i do love betting on politics so i bet a lot during all the elections and i'm like this is ridiculous like i have to go and predict it which is basically run by like i know some sort of intelligence agency and it's like wisdom of a crowd like give to the democratic party or something and like my limit is like 800 i'm like i don't want this is unfair so like things like auger and you know other people trying to build decentralized prediction markets for an interesting use of crypto because they're trying to bypass they're trying to build decentralized products bypass u.s regulation right or like to create other optionality and um yeah i thought that was that was a very that was a very interesting product but too early you know just does your history of politics betting have a positive roi you know people don't understand uh political betting because when i was i put all my i got into the nature of like putting my predictions making my predictions public and before 2020 i was like i'm buying all the like yes trump shares right and then when trump lost i'm like ah like you lost money i'm like no you idiot the cool thing about this stuff is that the way that you know like the betting companies like work out how much to sell these things for is you know look at the polls and polls were ridiculous it's like on the day of like the election the [\u00a0__\u00a0] income president is like seven percent it's like it's so ridiculously underpriced you could buy it on the day of the election you could buy like yes from like seven seven cents i think it was like 18 cents actually and sell it like one day when he was when some of the results came in everyone's models were off and we were like selling it like 73 cents a share right so you're just like basically just trading out it's it's it's not a buying thing it's not like you're like waiting so i was like trump is massively undervalued right now because all the polls are wrong and all the polls are run by like democratically led you know like av like abc news owns 5 38 and everyone's like why does nate silva say xyz it's like well you know his boss know he's like he's owned by disney it's like bob i get like he was going to be a democratic presidential nominee you know so it's like you just can't trust any of this i just want to bet against the polls so but i guess and the other thing i made money on which was so ridiculous is that biden was not in the running for being the democratic um representative he was not he was massively undervalued even he was lower than pete bridges at the time so i also bought into biden doing that so i just bet against the news um yeah i really i i really i really enjoyed 2020 and 2019 for that expand okay nice nice um so going back to irving it sounds like your mental model of how orbit wins is basically that uh increasingly people will find that they need it more and more over time that's kind of how you see orbit growing and winning in the long run people are going to realize that you can't have like like everyone's like why did twitter do this like why robinhood do this it's like well they're like owned by like you know big fans like totally you know work very closely with the state like they don't have a choice it's not like jack dorsey like the robin hood ceos just there like you know what we're gonna do we're gonna [\u00a0__\u00a0] over our users like you know they're probably like we're like quite cool people but you don't have a choice unless the thing is actually decentralized right you have to like you have shareholders you have you know you work with regulatory opposite um you know groups and the thing about urban is they built from the very beginning protection from having to do that and i think that that's going to make it very interesting because people are going to realize over time that as the state you know loses their stronghold with the dollars i imagine they're going to increase their stronghold on a lot more other things like in my mind america's like slowly becoming north korea like you say this to americans they like hate you for saying this but it's like ridiculous right like the idea that we live in the land of the free i mean we just everybody has to get over this now just like america used to be the land of three it's not the land of the free anymore in my mind something like urban is actually the land of the free because it's not that curtis or galen or anyone on the urban team can like do anything they're giving you the tools and they're saying you can do whatever you want here are the tools to go organize yourselves and that philosophically i think will catch on more as people realize what the how bad the alternatives are do you believe that jeffrey epstein really killed himself jeffrey epstein is alive unfortunately he's still alive where is he in uh cuba with tupac and the dinosaurs or what i have no idea i have no idea but the idea that like here's the thing my only model of the of like politics is it i am just so humble about how much i don't know which is not the average person the average person is like well the news told me this and i'm like i mean come on like it's you're never gonna actually know like in a machiavellian sense what's happening behind the scenes and there are these little things that happen that make no sense right and everyone's like we have to fit this into the world model that we have that's been given to us by the news and i'm just like i have no idea like it seems very clear that epstein's stuff was somewhat playing on a much much higher level around like intelligence agency were like who knows right that stuff is not gonna be easily revealed right and um you know is is epstein darrell alive like i'm humble enough to know i i just don't know um but my guess would be that he's a very important asset for some people and that you know like it's like it's like john mcafee you think john mcafee killed himself like absolutely no way you think he's still he's such a badass if there's one person who could convince he could get out of a spanish prison and be alive and not even tell his wife or anything it's [\u00a0__\u00a0] john mcafee that guy is dope um i agree i agree with all that but i feel like precisely for those reasons uh he would never just stop you know acting in public uh that that's seems like out of character for him so i have a hard time understanding yeah if the alternative is prison right then who knows like i just yeah i don't know i all i'm going to say is like on the epc mcafee stuff is like i just don't like the real humble thing is to be aware that the world like there's that michael hoffman what's it called um secret societies and psychological warfare such a good book but it's like the idea that we understand what's happening at the very top level as like surfs right and i think about this the analogy is when i worked at intel because you work at intel you're like all the employees like think that we're working towards something and they're like the c-suite like actually you know doing something else and then the board had like other goals right and it's like there's like some sort of symbiosis between every level but i didn't really understand this concept of the deep state until i worked in a hundred thousand personal organization i was like okay well there's actually like there's actually like a strategy going on they're like no ever it's not it's not efficient for everybody to know the whole strategy right you just gotta give little people a little part so that they can do the bits that they need to do and once i realized that i was like okay well this is how the rest of the world works right because actually the most efficient thing is there's to be a narrative at every level so like the stuff about politics i just i'm just very humble that i just don't know okay okay fair enough yeah fair enough but you don't believe he killed himself it's one thing to not know things but you also have to uh be equally incredulous towards what they what what they what they say is true the thing that really threw me was do you did you see the ep scenes through a side note on 60 minutes i i forget tell me yeah because like it was somewhat believable perhaps maybe i probably like you know the guys were asleep and the cameras didn't work like sometimes when i just like tell people outside the u.s it was like people outside the us like you know my goddaughter came to visit and i was telling her the epson story as i was telling it i realized like how ridiculous it was like she was not just like 18 could not stop laughing but it was really the suicide note that got me it's like only 60 minutes had the exclusive with this service i know which i thought was believable the service i know it was like he ran this like jumble text like food is bad like can't shower like something like that like time to die or something like this i was just like come on like you're it's like we only 60 minutes has this like suicide note that like comes from an extremely smart man who'd been on the phone to his like girlfriend the day before and like i don't know it it makes it makes no sense the uh the elite circles move in in interest in interesting ways right all right i love it love it so on this podcast we sometimes play a little game called baster cringe i'm going to give you a concept a topic a person a theme and i don't want to hear your nuanced you know interesting sophisticated takes i want to hear just yes or no up or down based or cringe based meaning yes cringe meaning no essentially so uh are you ready yeah so you studied philosophy at ucl uh what do you make of the philosophy of nick land based or cringe bass all right anything that say about nick land or excuse i want to know what uh people think well i read a lot of his stuff like a while back and i was like i was accelerations and stuff is like nihilistic and i'm just like nah like i wanna i i understand the minus it's not actually nihilistic i just wanna get to the next thing now yeah and i i used to be a little bit more naive about that okay okay how about the now common practice or fashion of polyamory cringe how about martin shkreli aka pharma bro bass based how about the bay area meme sociology of rationalism oh extremely cringe say more about that i mean uh you know i gave a talk at a rush like one of the first ea global you know was very much involved with the rationales rationalist groups i gave a talk about the value of rationality i mean you just heard my pitch about histological anarchism like if you i basically think that the rashes muse movement was like a support group for like people on the spectrum in berkeley okay um how about billy eilish oh cringe cringe um how about jeremy bentham yeah i mean he's based i mean his dead body is like in our university i thought it was so cool yes i was like that i used to walk past i think they like close it now like even ucl which is like one of the first free thinking university in england that came after oxford and cambridge allowed women to come in set up by three philosophers like even now that's becoming work and apparently they're like hiding his body because they thought it was offensive or something i was like that literally was his dying request and i thought it was so cool i walked past his like stuffed corpse every day when i went to the philosophy department i was like what a dude would you sit with him and spend time with his dead body kind of meditating or reflecting and you know i i have to be extremely honest i i barely attended university so no um but uh but the times when i did go into my exams i definitely did say hi to him so you're cutting class a lot what were you uh doing when you were cutting class running my toy store so i put all my lectures i focused very much on epistemology and i put all my lectures on a thursday um so i would only miss one day of running the toy store but i still like finished and got my degree like i think it's such a people always presume i must have dropped out or something i did the whole i did the whole time i just i i was already so interested in philosophy i didn't need to go to the class i was like reading it all actually in the toy store the window of our toy shop just had teddy bears reading like heidegger and stuff so okay nice okay i got distracted uh wet brain oh uh based i love this all right and finally uh elizabeth holmes oh it's tricky yeah um uh yeah i actually i i don't i don't know i'm gonna side with cringe because when i read the stuff in the court case with the text messages and all that stuff i was like nah i kind of thought you were cool and like this stronghold but like she not apologized like it's weird now like shakali is cool to me because like he's consistent and he actually didn't do anything bad he didn't do anything that farmer isn't doing the whole time anyway me and george hearts and a bunch of friends actually protested outside twitter when she currently got banned um but uh yeah elizabeth holmes no i'm i'm not clear i'm too honest i didn't follow it so deeply because i wasn't okay fair enough yeah i have a soft spot in my heart for elizabeth holmes i think she probably is guilty of fraud but um i'd like her and i think she i just think i mean i think she's kind of an interesting example of uh what you were saying earlier in the conversation about uh believing that you can basically bend physics to your will i think she kind of believed that and that's pretty based yeah i also think that she's just escaped like the idea that it could all be her fault right um and the same thing for kelly and stuff like that like we have to have these like scapegoats that we like sacrifice like and like the morally bad people in the world um but what she did compared to like hundreds of other companies exist on a day-to-day basis it's like not any better or any worse if anything she should have just never apologized and like [\u00a0__\u00a0] you like that's cool what did you write europe so that's the end of that game thank you what what did you write your undergrad dissertation about i was curious well i did two you're only meant to do one but i decided to submit two and i was very obviously interested in political philosophy and my main university decision was called justifying a minimal state so it was like you know uh nausic and and it was a lot of austrian economics but basically just you know arguing very much that we should have a minimal state so like i it really was a great feeder for me to enter the bay area because like i come from a very libertarian mindset when i'd been at university but the other um paper that i also submitted was on plato and love it's like focusing on plato's symposium um because i i always had like these two things in my mind like i can't be political without being creative like even though you weren't mentioning two distinctions i did two anyway because i just like i wanted to write about political philosophy but i love like reading about all the platonic ideas of love like there's like seven different types and i i just wanted to do a second essay um so so yeah two i did too right so i noticed that love is something you've written about in some of your past essays i something caught my eye where you said that love destroys people like alcohol destroys people but then later in the essay you seem to also kind of say that maybe it is possible to love without being destroyed so which one is it uh i think well i think you know sarah is saying like one of the things i found interesting is that when i'm uh like really close with someone and like actually my friend said this before i said how do you know you're in love with someone she said because i'm no longer afraid which i really liked um and you know maybe is it possible for love to not destroy you i mean eventually right because like even if you love someone they're gonna die like it's it's uh it's a there's always a sense of loss eventually um but uh yeah i don't know it's not like uh it's something i'm still trying to figure out it's it's um fair enough so that's why i guess why i did the s that's why i did essay on plato because uh like uh my favorite quote actually about love is from iron rand which is surprising but she wrote a quote which is in the fountain head says um i how can you say i love you until you know what the i is and i love that quote because i think most people go into relationships they go into it because they need somebody else right to like balance them out and um the best relationships i know like i love jimin and his wife and some other older older friends that i have like they're two very individualistic people who have this like shared experience like maybe in those situations they don't have to get burned um nice yeah i don't yeah sure fair enough interesting just curious you mentioned that in your toy story you had the toys in the front uh reading heidegger so i'm curious what you've learned from heidegger do you agree with heidegger's theory of technology where modern technology is this like uh all-consuming cybernetic system that wants to entrap a human being and turn it into objects to mean to be manipulated do you agree or disagree well it's uh interesting time to ask me because i've gone from like the trans humanism are i've gone through transhumanism to ted kazaninski art very quickly you know it's like is that right into san francisco i give all of these talks about transhumanism right like i was actually what i was known for when i came to the days like i'd run this group in berlin called blind singularity where we talked about like longevity extreme life extension i i'd um i was working with like david pearce set up a the philosophy of a neuro ethics group and i was working with him about how we think about like human enhancement and very technology focused and the more i got into the space and the more my world model kind of like evolved i become much much um you know i uh heideggerian like perhaps not if you i can agree with almost everything in the universe manifesto like it's like he's a genius i think because who knows if he actually said the male bombs but you know very very smart guy who saw a lot about what would happen in the future but i i i don't know who actually said this originally because jesse mentioned it on the podcast i did with him but it's about like how every piece of technology maybe was marshall mcluhan but like every medium of technology is an amputation of of the human right like yeah prosthesis a prosthesis yeah yeah yeah is that mclaren is that that okay cool so i do remember it quickly so you know i get that now right like you used to be able to follow a map and i need google maps and you're supposed to do all these things like we're outsourcing it all and i have become more human-centered now i do still want that to be uh you know life i i care very much about it like i've cared about the longevity space since i was a teenager um so i do want uh you know and i don't think that as trans humanism necessary as technology like even the family fathers would want our health to be better and that technology is the best way to improve these things but the idea like actually kevin kelly's views and what technology wants are very interesting because he thinks of technology as like other kingdom of life right and that we're like building this technium um and i found that interesting because then you know people who are interacting with this need to be more philosophical like need to be more ethical in how they think about it because much more powerful is how it shapes society so i don't want to just go live in a cabin i don't i don't actually i mean i sometimes i do but like i do think it's important that people who are in these spaces come at it also who value the human spirit right like i do want to enhance humans but i don't want us to lose our you know um our uh like people are not getting happier with these things right interesting that's very interesting how you describe your path from transhumanist to kaczynskiite uh that that's a major that's a major transformation it seems yeah i mean i i still want i i'm somewhere in the middle of both maybe that makes me an mpc but like i do want some of the end goals of transhumanism in terms of i do want people to be happier but like the iso here's something that take away like the idea that we should just change like i mean david piss sometimes goes towards negative utilitarianism which is definitely not i don't i hate any type of utilitarianism but oh but you said jeremy bentham is based jerry method has basically put his dead body in the thing but he did ruin falsely with utilitarianism like the idea that we have like is like toddler socialist math like calculate like happiness is so realistic you were saying utilitarianism is cringe david piss and the idea that we want to change people's head don't accept points right so that they don't experience extreme suffering now there's a great book i think it's called the genius of madness um right which is like it's not the neurotypical people who do great things in this world if we just knocked out all of mental health issues or like change like knocked out on a gene level like any kind of uh neurodiversity it'd be very bad right um so understanding the value of like this kind of diversity and you know the people who experience the lowest lows experience the highest highs like everyone's like connie's gone crazy i'm like no connie's a genius there's a reason he can do the things he can do and have that power um and uh alexander the great was probably bipolar and like you know virginia woolf like do i want them to like be accountants like not really that you've got to think about all this stuff the transhumanist stuff about like changing hedonic set points you just got to calculate in like what the second order effects would be if we try to over optimize for things which is what people like this is the thing i hate about silicon valley we go to conferences now people one of the opening questions you guys like what are you optimizing for i'm like i hate it you know yeah i said recently well actually has to be overly optimized for like something like a lot of nature is optimizing for the right reasons like nature is very smart goals and planning and optimization it's very middle of the bell curve like the truly power the truly powerful have no time for it you just live yeah which is my arg i'm sorry my argument against the russians community right because the people who are really doing exceptional things they might be thinking about thinking but they're not trying to like i don't know confine it into some sort of system um and i i didn't want i would say one thing i did get very strongly from the rashes community which i am very grateful for is that they really taught me about bayesian epistemology which i didn't do a lot in university but understanding stuff in terms of probabilities and your priors and adding a probability to it to be able to update later is a very good way of like thinking through arguments and i am very grateful actually to i got that from the people who are involved at cfa so and but but to only index on that would be ridiculous right right so i use that when i need to but the rest of the time i'm trying to be like fair rabbit hell yeah i like it so bay's rule is based kanye is based but not too much basically i would love to learn a little bit more about you know what you find most interesting right now what how are you spending your time what are you working on right now yeah uh so i stopped working intel in june 2020 i mean yeah she's running around 20. and my dad got sick and he passed away i don't know i actually don't like the time password like people who are just like force you to say hello my father died in january 2021 and i said to myself you know what i i had to work a lot since i was 16 because i had to financially provide for my family and my dad had like a lot of carers and help and stuff so i suddenly was like okay well i have surplus money now and i have like the freedom of not caring like caring full-time for somebody so i'm gonna take a year off and i'm not gonna allow anyone to pay me to do anything i'm just gonna see where my mind goes in terms of my own interest and it's a very interesting thought experiment to give to yourself because who who who are you without the world telling you who you should be right like who are you if you remove the internet remove social media and just like say like i'm just gonna go research stuff i spent all of last year just traveling trying to not be online that much and just see where my mind took me in terms of interest and um you know i always go back to the same things which is like science and epistemology they always just come back to them and i was collecting all my articles from the last few years they all have the same theme and i was like okay well if you reread fair admin what can i do with the next few years of my life that could contribute towards the acceleration of science and things that i care about and one of the things i picked up on was i think some of the views and around infectious diseases are wrong so it had a lot of hype right now because of covert but you know i work with a virologist before viruses were even cool like four or five years ago when i was in london i went with a virologist to get like a blueprint of like every antibody i had like look at my disease like what diseases i've been exposed to because there's a lot of correlation between being exposed to endemic like diseases that are now endemic but like later issues in life so there's a people that came out that you know really made the rounds about two months ago about how epstein-barr virus which is mono glandular fever like has a very strong link to multiple sclerosis later in life and um there's this one uh uh evolutionary biologist called paul evil that i love he writes he's been saying for a long time like cancers and a lot of this stuff seems to be coming from earlier exposes exposure to pathogens and i've been interested in toxoplasmosis so toxoplasmosis if you've heard of it it's like it's like the parasite that you get from cats and that's where the crazy cat lady um uh uh uh idea came from and my mom is schizophrenic and has spent a whole time looking after cats i was always convinced when i was younger that she had toxoplasmosis and and the more i started looking at toxoplasmosis last year the more i was like this is insane like i you know up to two-thirds of people like have this parasite in their brain which is like latent which is basically changing their everyday behavior right and now i think of my mind like my like my agency is in between of like pathogen damage um and then the more you look at this stuff you look at breast cancer tissue samples it's more specifically significant that they have um ebv exposure than even genetics and everyone thinks of cancer as being very genetically focused so the more i was looking at the more and i i'm taking the fair auburn approach which is that we seem to be wrong about how we think about infectious diseases and how they affect the brain alzheimer's could be a there's a lot of research such as alzheimer's could be a prion it could be coming from prions and misfolded proteins which is why surgeons see and people who are around people who have alzheimer's that might be getting by by like contagiously like it's so insane so and if this is correct then science is going in the wrong direction i'm on the right direction but at least overlooking it slightly so for the last few months i've just been working on neuroimmunology i'm setting up this like research foundation not to do the research myself but i realized that this is unoverlooked uh area of science that what i'm doing right now is i'm getting researchers to write an explicit list of uh like people who already you know think directly this way an explicit list of what we would like people to work on and i'm putting like a bounty price like we're waiting like how valuable this research would be i'm sure put it out as a research foundation saying like you want two hundred thousand dollars we want this data um and i think it'll just be very interesting to bring that um like if if it's even if it's even if it's like poor evil things are like eighty percent of cancer comes from infectious diseases even if it's 10 that's huge right so i just want to fund that so i've really been working on that for for like the last six months or so i'm gonna launch the foundation in in mid mid-may fascinating so i'm curious how you think about the challenges of designing research funding what does firebend teach you about optimizing or creating a pluralistic anarchistic kind of research design context or environment yeah it's actually really funny because i have a book here well i can't see it but it's like um uh the methodology of scientific research programs it's not actually fair album it's uh emery is it imrae lakitas it's like the guy who who so fire albans against method was actually a dialogue with with another guy and other guys reading all this stuff about design i spent a lot of time reading about designing uh scientific funding vehicles and one of the reasons why i've gone to this bounty approach is there's two things one when you go and try and raise money for like a foundation like people pitch me for non-profits all the time i'm like where is this money going actually my one of my best friends from university runs a company that just audits charities right like they're pretty bad like it's just like goes towards like you know bureaucracy so one of the reasons why i've thought about as this model of like just pricing it as bounties is that not only can someone invest into the give money to the research foundation but it's a very you know accountable thing that you can say like i want to fund this one research area it's like here's a breakdown of the cost and this is where the money is going to go i'm going to do this as a bounty and this is how valuable is the space so i'm trying to add transparency to this to this and have it more of like a software model because people who i want to raise from like the people who are who've made money from crypto like they think like this we think very systematically that's what got us interested in things like blockchain so you can't just go around and be like we want to raise millions of dollars so there's like secret non-profit we're not going to tell you where the money goes i want to be very very clear i want to be there to be you know very specific points we want researchers to go out and do and the other thing doesn't have to be in the us the cost to do research is extremely expensive in the u.s there's a lot of bureaucracy here if there's 20 kids in india who want to go dissect mice for me to like understand how linoleic acid plays in toxoplasmosis i'll give them the best funding of their lives the bounty model is just what we're starting with i think we're going to learn from that as well and again like we're asking for very specific data um very specific questions and then how they how the people go about it might surprise us right and that's the fair album approach i'm not saying like you have to do it a certain way or you have to do this research um i found crazy research recently by like reading stuff that's outside the us um then i have to translate it which is hard but uh but yeah no um i'm definitely gonna try fascinating okay so you think there are a lot of opportunities in uh neuroimmunology and you think there are these kind of alternative theories of of disease that are systematically neglected and you want to build a research organization that basically throws funding in a in a structure in a kind of structured anarchistic way uh to optimize for research on on these uh neglected areas anything else you're working on or things that you're particularly interested in at the moment it's like i can never do one thing right like i i just can't if i if i only work on the neuroimmunology stuff like i have this like my i mean you can't see my apartment you can kind of see my apartment but my apartment isn't insane right i can see my art project in here and i have an art studio downstairs like i paint it's just like i have this creative side on hashtag i have to do stuff so one of the other goals i have so we have this problem which is i think there are different areas of science which aren't like um that aren't on the right structure to get the information that i would like to learn about the other problem is that we have a massive crisis in self-efficacy it's like people don't believe that they can achieve things and i've thought about this a lot and like how do we make people realize their own power right like how do we make people be more ambitious like where are all the john golds of this world you know there's a few um like i don't think elon musk has any security issues when he goes and taps into a new industry like he thinks of it as like a game and when you talk to people they're like well this expert says this like i don't have this skill like blah blah blah and i want to find a way especially with the younger generations to instill a higher level of self-efficacy in them so one of the projects i've been working on for the last it's like two years now because it's been so complicated as a we i got one of my favorite authors so i won't name because he's been writing under a pseudonym but uh we've re-written an atlas shrug as a tv series so it's like a 13 episode one hour each and it's very well done like the movies do not do it justice i don't think it works as a movie because it's very long text it's like a very sexy mad men style version of atlas shrugged very well done and the reason why i want this thing to work is that i want young people to watch this tv show and be like i want to be like john galt or hank riordan or dagny tag it right i don't want to just be on tik tok being like i want to be like kim kardashian the way that we inspire the next generation is not by telling them or like writing wrong articles about how they need to have how self-efficacy we need to give them examples so you think about like what brought more people into working in technology i don't think it was like mark andreessen's blog post it was like the social network the movie because you see this nerdy kid gets makes money and gets laid and then everyone's like [\u00a0__\u00a0] i should go into this industry so i want to create these archetypes which is what iron man was doing the young people will want to look up to you in a very sexy like attractive way so i've been working on that for a long time but the rights and the estate it's been so complicated and the joke is that i'm like if it gets it takes any longer i'm just going to create a documentary about me trying to make atlas rug the tv series it'll just be like the analogous story anyway because i'll be daddy tagger trying to make it basically fine it's like i know but something's definitely going to happen but yeah i've been i've been working on that for like over a year and a half now wow okay that's fascinating idea well hopefully hopefully some netflix executive is watching this and uh well i'm not putting on netflix no even someone like that they would like edit it right it's like you have to have full control like iron rand would not want it to be on netflix okay interesting so then how do you i mean that's an interesting larger kind of meta question how how do you think about like cultural uh distribution then how do you think about me independent media and you know do you think that there is this kind of necessity for radical individuals and creators and intellectuals to really try to stay outside of the system as much as possible have your own distribution totally independent on all things or how do you think about that uh well you know i think you have to you have to weigh up between you want a lot of distribution because you won't have the largest impact but you also don't want to have to change like for instance i mean it's such a hilarious example but you know most of hollywood is you know under like the writers guild like unions and stuff i can't be a union production about a shrug right it's like it's ridiculous right take it to nephews it like censored the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of it i mean there's anything bad but like even the word atlas rod you take it through hollywood like most people haven't read it um and they still criticize it they have an idea of what they think it's about um but it's actually about a female protagonist it's actually a very uh if it's a very lit liberals if you think about it and we really have focus on that as a unbelievable female protagonist story uh she's a hillary clinton of the industrial age um but uh um you know in terms of distribution night there are new platforms coming up um and there are things that are going to be more sensitive [\u00a0__\u00a0] resistant but i'm just very ambitious like i'm like money goes a long way so when i'm like trying to fundraise for alistar and i was like how are you going to distribute it my ideas are very big i want the first episode to show for free and like every amc in america i'm like oh yeah you want to watch atlas shrugged it's for free in every local cinema and i've just a huge amount in my you know it's gonna cost millions of dollars or tens of millions of dollars like that's the level that i'm thinking i'm like i will i will beat everyone's prior you know biases of this of this book it's exactly what iran would have wanted she would have wanted something big impactful and creative i'm gonna go like beg a netflix executives like go do it i'm like nah oh if however much it costs me i'll raise it because of people who will understand the potential impact of this stuff will realize like how powerful it will be like do it very well so so basically it sounds like your your metal model is go full independent but then uh get distribution yourself just by getting a lot of money yeah yeah i mean money goes a long way like yeah i i realized how uh how fickle hollywood was when um you know i mean especially post covert because like a lot of things haven't gone into production and he told different people and you know hollywood has lost a lot of money and um yeah it's uh i think there's any time for anyone to outlet struggles now yeah that's fascinating i mean don't you think also though money is a weird conformity vector as well like you're right money goes a long way but it's kind of gross it's kind of sad isn't it when you see like uh someone like raises money and then everyone's like you know super interested in that person who just publicly got a lot of money so i think you're totally right it's like a very powerful tool to just mobilize a lot of people but in a way it's also kind of sad because those people those are kind of the npcs right like they'll do whatever money tells them to do kind of yeah uh but i know that my intentions are good so in my case i'm like atlas drugs should exist i wanted to be a next generation of builders you know and how do you do that like i mean we are already living at the store like when gavin houston came on the news and those trains had been looted i was crying laughter i was like literally i mean iran must be laughing at her great like it's so funny is the basis of atlas rugs right now it's so funny so who is the most based hot hollywood actress who would have to play dagny taggart i've been thinking about this a lot and here's the thing there's you know i as i've navigated trying to do this um there's a lot of people who you know are actually and i don't really like the word based so much because has his own connotations but people who you know have been uh you know it's not radicalized like you see what happened in the last few years i've been like wait what is happening like i care about california i don't want gavin newsom to like drive the state into the into the fiery death it's going to go into um so trying to people people pick up on people's political views and i've been very surprised actually about how many atlas shrug fans there are in hollywood like for instance i didn't i didn't know this i went into this but before brad pitt and angelina jolie got divorced they were trying to make their own version about the shrug but they would play john dagny tagger and i was like that is fascinating so there are i mean it's an unbelievable book there's almost like no one that i know who's genuinely actually read the book which is very long who doesn't like it so even if someone in hollywood is smart and there are a bunch of smart people in hollywood if they've read the book like they think it's cool it is a weird thing like i definitely read every word of that book in high school and i really liked it and then when i got to college it was very unfashionable and i kind of uh i kept reading stuff like mises i read like a ton of the austrian economic stuff when i was in undergrad but i had this distinct memory as a young man that it was like not cool to like that stuff so you know i wanted to get laid and that kind of stuff so i kind of like was a closet like austrian economics guy in college uh but i i remember like there was a strong kind of like social penalty for uh like being interested in that stuff which is why i want to do the tv show right it's like nobody read the book the book is trying to tell young people to read like 1 300 pages it's not like useful they're like watching tick tock but making a very sexy tv show that actually isn't like it's not political or i think it just has these archetypes of people to look up to and they are cool and they have amazing love lives they have amazing stories i mean the most powerful characters to me and i struggle is lillian ridden and uh like these these archetypes of characters are like stop progress or like put a damper on things once you see it in this show or in the book you start to recognize it everywhere like new sum is a classic randian villain right and so is mark benny off all these people like every time i see them i'm like oh it's you know it's ellsworth to you or whoever like i see them right so i just want these concepts to go into young people's minds so that they they have a at least at least i'm not saying that they have to love atlas trump but at least i'll add to their spectrum of extremely terrible people to look up to a few more they're a little different i'm very interested in this theme also of how to kind of uh excite and liberate the youth how to how to help people uh especially young adults kind of see like how much more badass and creative and radical they could be if they just decided to do you in your experience or in your observation like are there particular interventions do you think that work like maybe some more everyday things than like doing a big movie is there something that you can actually tell a kid is there something you can do with a kid or a young adult to shake them and like break break break the mental shackles you know peter till you give everyone a hundred thousand dollars for college and if you're smart now you and you're a young kid you just make that with on with d5 now so uh you know i think there are ways that just by the nature of like different systems are emerging will just happen by nature right that people are starting to think outside the box because they don't need to go you don't need to go to harvard business school if you figured out defy right it's like how the business was not even understanding what's happening at deepik right right so i think you know it's it's the next generation is going to be very interesting because they grew up on the internet like i really only got i mean i was on the internet when i was young like 15 plus but i mean i met a 14 year old the other day who'd been playing with ethereum for like six years so you know it's a very it's a very different mindset um but what can you do i don't know i think one of the responsibilities of the people who do work in these systems like in technology or in crypto is to show the young people that we're having fun this maybe isn't so much like what young people can do but to go back to the social network analogy like it works to say like hey if you do these things you're also going to enjoy your life and um and i think that makes me sad because people make money in tech and they're like living in these minimalist houses like fasting all the time i was with my friend rob reinhart the other day like he said he was the founder of soylent and he lives on this ranch in marble when he hosts these big dinners he came to las vegas with his pet piglet like he's such a surrealist like soulful individual he's like enjoys his life um we were talking about how like you know the wellness stuff like people don't eat gluten anymore like all of these ideas that everyone's so restricted i think it's our responsibilities people who've like been successful to show that if you do work hard it is going to be rewarding for you right because i'm like who do young people look up to like i think elon musk is having fun i think that he had a big change in 2016 and came very far on the internet so he showed that like working hard can be fun but we've got this kind of mindset you know there's like cheryl sandberg all these people just like you have to wear a hoodie every day and you have to like be very minimalist like it's all about just working like you know and i want to say i want to i think it's very important that we show that it can be extremely fun and rewarding and if there's beauty like there needs to be more we need to put more beauty in the world to inspire the young generations to not become like nihilists like they're going to become nihilists because who are they going to look up today none of us seem like we're having much fun i mean i'm trying to kind of synthesize your world view as i'm getting it in these different pieces in this conversation and it's interesting because it's it's like you're kind of you're obviously pro technology you're pro you know you're kind of technological progressive in in a way but you're also kind of trad like you're not into polyamory and you're not into you know a lot of the stuff that is kind of associated with the so-called transhumanist crowd that maybe you were kind of more associated with in the past you're more into things like kaczynski now i feel like the rivetez model of the future would be something like should you know you do like a private charter city or like a private you know city dow with you and your friends and you basically just select for the most badass happy beautiful ambitious energetic people uh go full on into crypto rails and basically just find a way to pretty much exit all currently existing institutions and like build your own kind of somewhat trad based like society um on your own outside outside of the mainstream institutions is is this the kind of stuff that you think about is that is that a promising avenue or do you not think in those terms no i mean i mean this is my exact reason for investing in practice which is you know they're trying to build and the reason why i invested in that there are different groups who've pitched me on charter cities or like cities right the reason why i like the praxis guys is that they fundamentally understood that it was not about politics it was not about crypto it was about culture the way you get people interested in this stuff is by making it culturally interesting and the way they thought about it when they were telling me about you know how do we change the self-efficacy of young people and how do we make them want more how do we build the gold skulls for the next generation isn't going to be like us writing all the value of charter cities like blah blah it's about you know putting those concepts in and like creating a funnel for young people like figuring it out on their own and like making that the this other thing look like a better option or you know not it's not a rational argument it has to be downstream from culture so that's one of the reasons why i have been you know some i'm working right now on a on a magazine for practice was like how do we get young people to um learn about these concepts like it's like it's got to be it's got to be cultural so yes it's going to seem fun it's going to seem like people you want to go join it and and think a lot about practice is that they hear all these parties right and everyone's like why are they favoring parties they're a start-up i know i think a party is extremely valuable because you say these people are having fun like what are they doing and that's a great entry point to learn about things um you know these young people aren't going to go read austrian economics or like you know uh my my cat who's right here is called milton right uh um and i don't know they don't read free to choose um but uh but if they go to a party and they're like what are all these cool people doing they're like oh we're actually gonna go go work on the city it's like well you know i want to go during that i think that's very powerful yeah i went to a practice party just last week in austin it was cool it was interesting it was very interesting yeah yeah it was it was very it was very like when i was when i was there after like 15 minutes i was kind of like so are they gonna like try to get me to buy something now or are they you know what like what's going on here is kind of it was kind of weird in a cool way because there was nothing to sell there was nothing there was no pitch there was just like we're gonna throw on this uh lovely dinner and have an excellent little party and that's just like that is what we're doing and i was like huh that is actually pretty creative and pretty outside the box when it comes to like strategies for for building a startup and it was it was really pretty cool well reba thank you so much for hanging out today this is fun thank you for having me",
