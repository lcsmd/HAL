  "transcript": "the people of New York call Hope Hicks folks hope Hicks took the stand she's testified today she's Donald Trump's former campaign press secretary Donald Trump's former communications director she worked at the White House from 2017 in 2018 and then she worked there again in 2020 and 2021 she was there during the Insurrection she hasn't spoken to Donald Trump in a few years and her testimony was absolutely devastating to Donald Trump from what we hear she was not looking at Donald Trump at all during her testimony she passed him by they never made eye contact with each other towards the end of her testimony on direct examination before Donald Trump's lawyer began cross-examination she started to break down in tears after what she testified to and here is what she testified to folks that Donald Trump had told her that Michael Cohen had made a payment on his behalf to stormmy Daniels in order to help Donald Trump in connection with the campaign Donald Trump claimed that Michael Cohen was just doing it because he wanted to be friendly hope Hicks testified that she did not believe Donald Trump she testified that Michael Cohen is not a charitable person and that she obviously believed that she was doing that he was doing it on his behalf she realized the import of her words she realized that saying that was a Perry Mason moment that would bury Donald Trump at this trial connecting it the way she did Trump's awareness of what Cohen was doing Trump's falsification of business records and she started breaking down in tears crying and crying um before cross-examination commenced just take a look at everything that went down but here's how Andrew Weissman described it a coup gr from Hicks Hicks says that Donald Trump told her Michael Cohen on his own paid Stormy Daniels to protect him so Trump eventually learned of the hush money payoffs on this uh telling of it which means later Donald Trump labeling uh reimbursement payments to Michael Cohen as legal fees would be false falsification of business records bonus hopix said that it would not be like Michael Cohen to make payments on behalf of um to make payments to stormmy Daniels out of the goodness of his heart and to not take credit for it again devastating testimony Adam clell's in the courtroom KFA is in the courtroom multiple prosecutors who we've been communicating with in addition to KFA are in the courtroom we have this from every angle folks here's what Adam clel says Trump trial News the people call Hope hick court officer witness enters hope hick shows up hope hick takes the stand and raises her right hand and is sworn in do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth hope pick says I do before settling in she says that she's nervous she says that she's afraid but she begins her testimony she talks about how she was a teenage model before following in her Father's Footsteps ultimately to be in the communications field how about four years after graduating from college she started working in the Trump organization and then that led her to become a press Secret AR for Donald Trump's campaign Hicks talked about the Trump organization's structure she said everyone who works there at the Trump organization in some sense reports to Donald Trump even if it's a big and successful company it operates like a small family business she says questioning pivots to Hop's media work for the Trump campaign question did you speak to Mr Trump in your role as the press secretary answer every day as Adam klasfeld says hopix DSE any notion that Trump was somehow out of the loop of anything in terms of Public Communication hope pick testifies Donald Trump knew what he wanted to say and how he wanted to say it we were always following his lead question did you send text messages for the campaign answer yes and did you receive text messages too answer yes they then showed her an email um from The Wall Street Journal requesting comment from Donald Trump Trump questions did Mr Trump have an extra marital affair with Karen McDougall was he or anyone close to him aware or involved in this contract between Ami and Miss McDougall when the Wall Street Journal found that out hope hick forwards that to Jared Kushner whom she wanted to press the matter with rert Murdoch the owner of the Wall Street Journal then Hicks talks about a conversation that she had with Donald Trump who at that time was in office he was the president and he said said that Michael Cohen as she says this she sigh he goes he said that Michael Cohen had paid this woman stormmy Daniels to protect him from false allegations Trump told her that Cohen did so from the kindness of his own heart and that he didn't tell anyone that it had happened she says but she says she did not buy it she did not believe it she saids that would be very out of character for Michael Cohen I didn't know Michael Cohen to be an especially charitable person or a selfless person he's the kind of person that seeks credit let me show you this right here this is from Lawrence o'donell who's been in the courtroom he describes this moment as then H pick after burying Donald Trump with that testimony walks past him they don't look at each other here play this clip today we actually had what may be a meaningful moment of that kind of observation and it was right at the end as we broke for lunch when witness hope Hicks was leaving the witness stand and she walked by Donald Trump within less than an Arm's Reach from each other and neither one of them looked at the other Donald Trump made sure that he was busy talking to Todd blanch and hope hick very deliberately avoided any any regard at Donald Trump any look at him it wasn't like David Pecker's uh smile to the defense table when he walked by that's allowed you know there's nothing wrong with HCK saying hi to her uh former boss as she walks by the table or nodding or smiling that's all available within the normal kind of behavior of that courtroom in that moment but it was there was nothing there was absolutely nothing between those two maybe that'll change maybe there'll be another moment where they exchange some kind of human silent human contact but not today it didn't didn't happen when they broke the lunch and hope pick and Donald Trump had not really been in communication um you know following the Insurrection um recall that she was there as the White House communications director from 2017 to 2018 then stopped working there she came back 2020 to 2021 so she was there during the Insurrection remember she testified as well before the January 6 committee here's what she testified to play the clip testimony when you wrote I suggested it several times and it presumably means that the president say something about being nonviolent he wrote I suggested it several times Monday and Tuesday and he refused tell us what happened um sure I I didn't speak to the president about this directly but I communicated um people like Eric hman um that it was my view that it was important that the president put out some kind of message in advance of the event and what was Mr Herman's response um Mr Hershman said that he had made the same you know recommendation um directly to the president um and that he had refused just so I understand Mr hman said that he had already recommended to the president that the president convey a message that people should be peaceful on January 6 and the president had refused to do that yes that was hopix of course from her testimony before the January 6 committee now I'm getting messages from prosecutors from people in the office again they're reiterating that was a Perry Mason moment as big of a Perry Mason moment that you will ever see in a white collar case others are telling me how she broke down crying it was one of the most powerful sites ever seen in a court and trial in my career another prosecutor tells me this was a bombshell moment folks will see what the jury makes of it look on cross-examination Donald Trump's lawyer Emil Bo tried to act like well you know Cohen's known to go Rogue he's known to create issues that's what that's where they were going with the cross But ultimately you have hope Hicks connecting Donald Trump to the knowledge that the payment was made and then ultimately what the jury's going to see in a little bit here's the check take a look I mean there's I think 11 Separate Checks um that were paid to Cohen and many of them were signed by Donald Trump himself like this check to Michael Cohen relating to this also at this time you had Donald Trump saying that Michael Cohen was a great lawyer a respected lawyer here's what Donald Trump said after these hush money payments were made Trump applauded Cohen here play this clip and by the way we just found out I was coming down Michael con I was being Michael con is a very talented lawyer he's a good lawyer of my firm wow folks this was
