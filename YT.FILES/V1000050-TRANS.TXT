  "transcript": "the first thing before anything happens at all is kind of going back to what are we trying to achieve what's the business imperative are we trying to reduce cost are we trying to increase productivity that has to be very clearly defined and understood the second thing after that is making sure that the leadership prison alignment then after that you have the communication so each work stream gets essentially a supervisor or leader that's assigned to that workstream that's another part of the structure [Music] reishi thanks so much for jumping on and volunteering to be part of my systems Thinking podcast Series so as I mentioned in the introduction letter like it's a perfectly candid conversation we've only messaged a couple times on LinkedIn but so like let's let's get into it so I always like to open these conversations with just a little bit of a back and forth introduction so obviously you know a little bit about me so tell me a little bit about yourself like where did you get like where did you come from what are what are your interests and that sort of thing and we'll just go from there sure thank you so much by the way for having me on your show really appreciate it so my name is Rishi pel I've been in North America about 20 something years I'm originally from Bombay India I moved to the US 20 years ago got my MBA and then I've pretty much been in management consulting for most of my career till till pretty recently till about I would say 5 to seven years ago when I really got interested in actually the applications of artificial intelligence to business problems and that's what i' I've been doing for for the now now about seven years excellent so you know as as you know systems thinkers as someone who has come from I mean I guess let's start there like you know crossing crossing cultures uh obviously there in in America in England in in the west there is a lot of immigration from India I've worked with lots of people either still in India Hyderabad other places but then coming to America so I guess the the the very first thing I want to know is like what are the cultural differences that you experienced or or that or that you learned and and Mo and I don't know now but more importantly but how has that shaped kind of your trajectory so I I think it really depends on on where where in India you're from so what I mean by that is like I grew up in Bombay which is or Mumbai which is a pretty big city and it's it was always very westernized so I grew up westernized and I grew up kind of with the influence of you know listening to guns and roses and you know watching uh you know watching The Wonder Years and things like that right so it's it's a very different experience when you come from that to uh to the us as opposed to some you know a relatively smaller town where it's it's very where the culture is so different uh so for me it was almost like actually actually like a reverse culture shock because when I first landed here I landed in New York and that was awesome loved it love you know it felt exactly like what I expected America to be but then I hop on a on on a plane and I go to where my University was which was somewhere in Virginia a small town and it was almost like a river culture shock because you know the bus ran once every hour or or two hours on the weekend and just not what I was expecting I mean there were there were no buildings taller than three floors I think like three floors was the highest and it that to me was more of a culture shock than anything else but you know also I think what I learned very quickly was the value of of individ individual freedoms here that that this that America or North American General AFF fors which which was you know a pleasant surprise to me because in India there's a lot of expectations that you to follow no matter what stage of life you're in what what what profession you're in ETC so so for me that was like almost like a revelation and a pleasant Revelation at that interesting so I mean there there's so much St unpack there one I just I think it's hilarious that like you you kind of grew up with like Guns and Roses you know listening to Gunners and then you get to New York City or or New York State I don't know if it was New York City and it's like this it kind of felt familiar but then you get to Appalachia and it's very different and that's I mean that's you I I grew up going to the uh the mountains of Virginia my grandfather has a cabin up there uh yes very very different culture probably lots of cow pastures near the university if I had to guess so you know well let's let's follow that thread a little bit and then we'll we'll get to like Ai and business management because that's obviously very interesting and very timely but one of the things that you said that was was a pleasant surprise was the the import importance of individual freedoms here versus I guess where you grew up in India where I I think the way that you said it was there's like some some expectations to be followed um and I guess it's more cultural expectations or maybe family expectations what what was your experience there in terms of the structure the system the lifestyle you know what are all the patterns of differences that you notice between there and here so I I think the fundamental when I say expectations natural as well as familial Etc it's it's almost like you have to have certain trajectory in your life otherwise you're a failure so it's like you know if if you're if you haven't gotten gotten an engineering degree or or or or a computer science degree or or you're not a doctor then it's almost like you're a failure or you have to you know you have to get married at this age and you have to do this and that and you know when I when I moved to to America I was like hey wait a second I can actually to really any path that I want you know like I had never for example I had never really heard of management consulting before or or you know I didn't really know what it was but when I learned about it I was like yeah that's something that is of super would be of extremely you know a big interest to me whereas culturally like I would have been expected to try to join a large firm and kind of work my way up there the ladder there and you know like it's it's a very traditional set and if you deviate from that path it's it's it's almost like you're kind of ostracized from society you know this is this is interesting because this is something that that I think about a lot and that is that you know in many cases you know there whether it's a family pattern or a local pattern or national like our societies our cultures have some kind of default paths or or expected trajectories for us you know like in America we have we have SL had the American dream which is you know you grow up you go to college you get a job you settle down in the suburbs so on and so forth it's a very very kind of like wellestablished well trodden path but more and more like you know it's not working for people or we're changing it or we're you know deviating from the path and so it's interesting is that you know like because that that's a social system right that is that is a a socially constructed and reinforced set of like Milestones right by this age you should have you know two children and a wife or this age you should have be this far in your career and there's only a few you know idealized careers I guess so you like when you when you have having had that life experience having had that trajectory and picked something that really resonated with you because that like you're you paying attention to a signal right there was something like maybe it was emotional or intellectual or maybe even social maybe you've found the right people so what was what was the signal that that you heard or felt that made you say like hey this career path is actually what's right for me what what resonated there so I should kind of take a step back so before I moved to America for two years I had kind of started my own small Web Solutions firm I was doing that so I had a sense of Independence you know this is I'm talking about the year 1999 to to 2001 approximately so I had a lot of freedom I I I really enjoyed taking on different challeng es taking on different meeting new people and kind of that problem solving right so when I learned about management consulting and what what it entails and what people do it was just very intriguing to me because I was like that's exactly what I want to do I want to basically find problems that are not necessarily simple talk to people find out what their real issues are and try to solve them and and that just resonated a lot as compared to you know like go into the same old same old same old job same old kind of care career path and that was that was it to me like hey I get to get to actually meet people get to solve different problems get to travel all over the US uh US and Canada and I just love that so you you said a few things one one reminds me of kind of a mantra that I came up with a while ago which is that any any problem is solvable when you have the right people in a room talking to each other so would you would you kind of agree with that as a as a consultant and as a as a Management Consultant 100% I mean that's really one of the ways to to get to some of the root causes of these issues these large issues that that we regularly deal with uh when you get the right people in the room that have different backgrounds different experiences come have different viewpoints and when you kind of bring that together that's when you really get to what's the real problem here so it's you know kind of alludes to the or is somewhat tangential connected to the systems thinking right which is how do you really get to what's the bigger picture what's the fun more fundamental issue that you're trying to address and not trying to fix just a symptom of the potential problem well you know and so when you when you when you're tackling these these problems like may maybe maybe now would be a good time for a story like what's what what's a story that you have you know from from your from your Consulting career trajectory or or you know career experience where you had some of these more complex problems the ones that really kind of get you stimulated because it sounds like you're you're a lot like me where more complicated problems are very interesting and then you just kind of feel more more energized so what was what was a good story around that like what were the right people what was the mystery like how did you get to that okay so I have tons of those by the way let me think about one that might be of interest okay so I did a project this is about I don't know 7 to 10 years ago something like that in a coal company like a 150 year old Coal Company somewhere near Pittsburgh and what we were tasked with was we you know we were given the problem of this company was spending close to $50 million in transportation annually uh the transportation spend so we w we were tasked with how can you can you reduce the transportation spend because it's it's it's a lot so we kind of started you know the 8020 rule looking at what's the biggest buckets of span and you know what are some of the opportunities and we just realized that there is something called truck detention and I had no idea what that meant uh so I start of kind of asking around what does truck detention mean and turns out that if a truck is waiting to load or unload and if it's a third party truck if it goes beyond a certain allocated time whether it's 30 minutes or an hour Etc it starts to get incur a fee and you know the fee might be 250 an hour 300 an hour so it doesn't sound like a lot for some of these companies but when you add all of that up it was something in the order of I would say couple of couple million three million something like that and and that obviously it adds up right and it's pure waste because it's it's just money that you're not you're just throwing down the down the drain basically so that was a good bucket to try try and kind of start and capture so I first started talking to the transportation director and kind of get get her opinion on you know what what is the potential problem and one of the remarks that she made was yeah you know it's it's a problem I I know it's a problem and you know some of the the lers are so lazy and they you know they they just don't necessarily they're not up they don't know when the truck is there Etc so what we should do is we should just put up an alarm so that when the truck arrives they can you know they will know that the truck is there and the bell keeps ringing and you know till they answer it right so I was like okay sounds like a reasonable hypothesis but why don't we actually investigate that why don't we actually verify that so we I drove in her car we sat outside of the factory and actually for 3 hours in the morning we actually noted down trucks going in and out and noted the timings and when you know how much do they wait and how much do they leave Etc so we did did kind of a verification and then after that what we realized or or what I had data to to show was that sometimes when the when a truck arrives it's not just one truck there might be three trucks arriving and at the same time there might be a rail car arriving so it's not like the that the the lers were lazy it's just that they're overwhelmed because you know you you got like a bunch of trucks loading and they have have no option to to to do anything besides let the other the other uh truck or the rail car Wait So what I realize that this is basically more of a scheduling issue than anything else what if you could schedule better what if we could actually schedule the third party to make sure that the the trucks arrive don't you know arrive in a staggered Manner and not not arrive all all of them at once right and that was one of the hypothesis and then we the other thing related to that was it would that that detention bill they would sometimes take about 3 weeks before you saw the baill and so if if a supervisor is looking at that bill after three weeks it's very hard to figure out what really happened that day and do any kind of analysis on it or try to make any improvements on it right one of the other things we realized was the the gate the gate entry actually had time stamps of every truck entering and and exiting so from that we were actually able to calculate the detention before hand right before we actually see the bill we were we were able to calculate the the detention right there and have that as a report to the supervisor that same evening so now you have a much shorter interval control that says I can analyze what happened today and maybe I can take proactive steps to address that or prevent that so as a whole collectively by looking at scheduling and by doing a more proactive look at how do you track that we were able to cut down their detention I don't remember the exact numbers but it was somewhere in the order of 50 to 60% from where they started and you know that was again like a I mean obviously there was other other people it wasn't just me that they were they were looking at Logistics and movement of goods Etc but that was in an area that was literally money that was just being thrown down the drain that we were able to capture and and actually utilize so you know that that's that's one example of how if you talk to the right people and kind of correlate that with actual observations to get to the root cause the result is better than just taking things at face value there's so much to unpack there so first thanks that's a that's a fantastic story perfectly illustrates many of the concepts um not just in systems thinking but organization and and investigation so you know you talk to the right people you come up with a hypothesis you gather information this is is all like relatively straightforward principles like you basic concepts um What In your experience you know why why is it that that you would need to bring in an expert so what I mean by that is why couldn't this Transportation director why didn't why didn't she figure it out on her own is it was it just a matter of perspective or inertia like maybe there's some institutional or organizational inertia and she just didn't think to look or she had made an assumption you know her assumption sounds like the workers were lazy and there's nothing you can do about that except maybe pay them more or you know punish them whatever but it was in this case it was very little that the workers had control over so what like what's the Gap there and and you know what what could other organizations or other people do to to identify those gaps so this is okay so this is just my personal opinion based on my experiences but what I feel is that companies and people tend to get into a rhythm and tend to get into you know the status quo right and no matter where you are in the hierarchy you generally don't want to rock the boat so you got your job you got a set of defined things that you need that you are given as your task it's very hard to take a step back and say okay I'm going to spend the next seven days investigating something that that I wasn't originally tasked with no nobody's getting paid for that and unless you you know unless you're hired within an organization as specifically a continuous Improvement manager or some some something of that nature it's really hard for people to kind of step away from their job take a big picture view and and say these are the things I'm going to resolve most companies unless you you know some of the top top companies in the US that that have everything figured out unless you are one of those companies the rest of the companies you got very very set defined set of rules roles and responsibilities people are assign those roles and responsibilities and people tend to perform to those expectations and and that's why I feel like you need that external view external perspective which not only addresses provides a different perspective but also that person has the freedom to that's their job like they have the freedom to to to kind of take a big picture view and say I'm going to talk to these 10 people I'm going to look through these departments I'm going to look through this systems or this data or these Excel reports or these PDF files right you generally if if that's your role and that's your task then you're you're able to do that but otherwise it's it's very difficult when you're ENT entrenched in that you know you know like for for the example that I gave this person this Transportation director she's super smart and she you know she knew her business so she performed to the the roles that she was expected to perform but it was hard for her to step take a step back and look at something outside of her her day-to-day activities yeah no and it makes perfect sense like you know people tend to stay within the boundaries of their defined role you know there's there's the the racy Matrix right the responsible accountable you know so on and so forth and and so then what you're saying is is really the solution or part of the solution is is is creating a structure right like you have to you have to you have to have someone who comes in with a with a systematically or structurally different set of objectives outcomes responsibilities and so because you came in with a different set of incentives it was it was your job to optimize this or to find a problem or to look at it differently and so because you're coming in with a fundamentally different point of view you're able to see things differently so that that that makes sense and it it it kind of all comes down to like what is the outcome that you're paid for or what are you being paid to achieve sorry if I may add you know the so I was in the last whatever 20 years or so I've been part of mostly mid to large siiz Consulting companies operations specifically operations Consulting companies that have a program in place so when they go in it's not just they don't just arbitrarily send people what they do is they really start at the top have a communic ation plan have get the buying from the leadership and then put a program in place it could be of 4 months to 6 months maybe sometimes 8 months program that says here's the different work streams that that are going to be part of this program here here are their objectives and it's not just external people so it's not just external Consultants what most of these companies did was or or do is that they got for every one consultant from outside they would get maybe two or three internal resources to work as part of that that program so it's it's a very it becomes a very collaborative approach so it's not just like a strategy firm where you get the strategy you know you you hand the strategy in your gone in operations Consulting what we did most of these firms did was you you build a collaborative program in which the clients feel that they are part of the solution not not just field but they are made to you know ensure that they they they they are part of that team they are part of that solution and that gets to much better results and and you know the point I was trying to make is like it's a structured program it's not just you kind of get thrown into the mix without in the deep end it's it's a full structured program that achieves that objective so I mean either either using or creating structure to me is is a big component of of systems thinking so what what variables or factors or kind of rules or paradigms go into that structure because it sounds like you know for for the operations Consulting that you're talking about there is a lot of structure that you bring right that's part of what your service brings um and it's it's interacting so that I guess taking a step back there's a few structures there's the existing client structure like their existing business so that's you know all the Departments all the people all the roles um you know then there's every person who's involved has their own experience there's the tribal knowledge that sort of thing then there's the structure of your consulting firm you know your operations consulting firm and then there's the structure of the project that you bring or that or that you create for them so what are some of the key aspects or pillars of these structures that you pay attention to that you use to design the inputs and the outputs and how do you measure the effectiveness like let's let's let's unpack some of that some of the the scaffolding and some of the framework there so I I think the first thing before anything happens at all is is kind of going back to what are we trying to achieve like what's the business imperative right are we trying to reduce cost are we trying to increase productivity are we trying to U make Logistics more efficient whatever the imperative is that has to be very clearly defined and understood because otherwise you're trying to solve a problem that you know like it may a be in a vacuum so you really have to always always start from that and then the second thing after that is making sure that the leadership is first of all bought into that because without leadership having bought into some of these implementations you don't get the you don't get the momentum so that's where you got to start with making sure that the leadership is in alignment and then work with them to to figure out okay so what departments should there be as part of this implementation and then of course we'll make recommendations as well like they may say well you don't need to talk to accounting and we'll say no no you you know we we really need accounting for making sure we can look into where the truck detention cost or Etc right so we'll make some there'll be some back and forth but then you build that that structure then after that you have the communication Because unless you have a clear communication of again like what are we trying to do what are the objectives what are these different work streams and what are they trying to achieve so you might have a work stream that's trying to improve productivity in in in the production line there may be another work stream that's trying to reduce downtime on the on the production line or some somebody's trying to reduce Transportation spend or improve logs whatever you have these different work streams so each workstream gets essentially a client leader supervisor or leader that's assigned to that workstream so that's on the part of the structure so that's the communication piece and then we want to usually build a feedback loop that provides updates and reports and kind of Direction at regular intervals and that regular intervals might might differ for you know what level you are at so the for the work stream it might be you have a daily report and you have a daily meeting but then maybe you have a weekly meeting with at at a one level about that and then you have a maybe you have a steer executive leadership steering committee meeting that gets an update every two weeks or four weeks to make sure everything is on track and then you you know you got to have the right key performance indicators kpis that track the the meas or or measure how far are you against what you said you you were going to be at so right to so making sure that whatever objectives you started with you got to make sure that you actually achieving those objectives or at least having moving in the direction of achieving those objectives and and that's kind of extremely important in in my view in making sure that this is is a success so when you start off it sounds like there's there's kind of two or three-ish kinds of things and so one is you're trying to increase something or decrease something so there's some there's some s some measurement uh whether it's productivity or costs or throughput so there's there's a value you're trying to change or there is a problem you're trying to overcome there's some some blocker or or or so I guess it is that kind of like highest level most abstract principle is those are kind of the two basic ways of looking at or maybe there's a third one which is you're trying to achieve something right would you agree with kind of that that assessment yeah t typically I think to your point it's it's typically you're trying to increase revenues or reduce cost those are the two primary things a third Rel ated one might be trying to improve overall productivity productivity meaning uh it takes me you know like I'm I'm doing something very complex in in terms of my services or offerings and it takes me 10 days to get a contract or get a code out and can I reduce that time frame from 10 days to maybe five days or two days right that might be productivity gain that somebody's trying to achieve and that could be another objective which is not necessarily tied to Financial but the the first two that I mentioned which is you got to increase revenue or reduce cost at a high level that's always tied to a very measurable Financial metric that you can always tie back to so no matter what you're doing like you know improve productivity well you can always say my current prod production is X and now after doing so my production is y and then I apply the the marginal cost of the product and that's my savings of over what I achieved not savings this is my Revenue increase of what I achieved or or the other way around like if you're trying to take out cost maybe I take out the cost of I used to spend 100 tons in raw material now I only it only takes me 90 tons of raw material and the cost of raw material is is this therefore my savings are are are are are why and that's how you kind of bring it back to the measurements and metrics for for anything unless you're doing something that's that's like more productivity and and in some cases it might be hard to measure but I I think you know that that kind of brings me to the the next things which is the evolution of technology has enabled in the in the last I would say you know 10 10 or so years 10 to 15 years to to have more objectivity to some of these measurements so when when I kind of started doing some of this you know 2006 2007 a is it was a lot of there was a lot of subjectivity to some of these measurements like we would you know sit sit on a line and do something called line studies where we observing you know how long does it take for widget a to go from this uh production line to the end of that production line and what's the average time Etc and those were all you know there was some subjectivity to it I mean you had stop stop watches and stuff like that but the more objectivity that you can bring to it as a result of Technology the the better the results are going to get because you now have data that that is really truly represents what's actually happening in the system as opposed to like some human human element of subjectivity that that used to exists before so it it it's what's really emerging to me as I'm as I'm listening you know there's there's something numbers right whether it's a measurement uh you know kpi money time what you're saying is a huge component of all this is measuring the right things and then optimizing those measurements so with those tight feedback loops and kpi you need to make sure that you have the right kpi and I want to ask about that in a second like how do you how do you identify a good measurement and then of course you're probably familiar with good Hearts law which is the moment that you measure something it becomes a bad measurement or whatever so let's talk about that into a second so but but the number one principle here is measure what are you measuring right and and sometimes it's not obvious and this is this is I think one of the most interesting things about systems thinking and about problem solving more broadly is for instance the scheduling problem right it was it was not necessarily obvious that the bottleneck was that you had three trucks arriving at once you had to look at the right information you had to go find the right information talk to the right people and then go measure it um and you know you you come up with a hypothesis you test the hypothesis and but and before we talk we before we talk about measurements um I want to say that the to me what what seems like emerging the second main pillar is the people so it's measurements and people because the first thing that you said is leadership Buy in right you need to talk to you need to talk to the you know the executives of the company that hired you make sure they're aligned make sure that they understand that they're communicating their expectations and I'm sure that sometimes they ask for one thing but you re you recognize they need another right they they might not you know an example being like oh you don't need to talk to accounting well maybe that was the problem is that they weren't they weren't talking to accounting the whole time but then also one of the one of the most interesting things that you mentioned was placing people directly in the work streams to provide that constant feedback to communicate to like I'm guessing it's two-way communication so like you know hey we're going to make this little change I'm going to tell you that this change is happening at the workstream level and then you get the feedback did it work what changed so on and so forth but then it's it's you know Downstream communication Upstream communication lateral communication so anyways it you know measurements and people is kind of what's emerging is kind of the two big food groups here what about the kpi or measurements how do you how do you make good measurements and how do you how do you know how do you measure the measurements like because I guess you have to measure the efficacy like are you measuring the right thing and that sort of stuff so let's let's dive into that a little bit uh you know I think fundamentally I'll kind of take a step back and and say that if you don't measure something you definitely it's very hard to to improve it because you don't know where you stand right so you have to measure in order to improve that's that's you know that's that's I think the fundamental thing now how do you how do you uh how do you start to measure in my opinion again it it kind of I would you know we we we built something that we call a kpi tree so kpi tree meaning you know if your initial objective was I want to save I want to improve productivity or I want to save x million you know let's say I want to take out 3 million in in in in spending in transportation right so okay that's that's a given right so then that's that's your fundamental kpi at the top level and from there what are the other kpis that buil towards it so it might be okay I want to look at truck detention I want to look at the overall truck movement spend I want to maybe look at cost per mile because maybe maybe different providers give me different cost per mile when I'm transporting so those might be kpis that kind of are are the second level and there might be more fundamental what I call uh kpis that are leading indicators so they are not necessarily tracking that particular kpi but maybe there's there's a leading indicator so in the example that I gave you the report that's coming out of the gate that's that's it's not an official report but it's it basically gives the downtime that today and that's the amount of downtime right sorry not downtime the amount of dwell time like the the cut truck sitting there so it doesn't really have the cost because the costs are all different across all different carriers Etc but I know the dwell time and from the dwell time that's a leading indicator of what my actual cost of drug detention is going to be so that's another kpi that if I measure today that becomes a leading indicator of my financial number that's coming later so it's yeah so we we build what what what we call a kpi tree in which there's a Cascade of kpis that kind of roll up to the objective that you're trying to finally achieve okay that I mean that that's fascinating to to me like you systematically go through and and and create like a flowchart of kpis like so you have the the main goal so the main goal is the value that you're trying to change whether like you said it's it's generally the top line or the bottom line um but then there's subsidiary or secondary kpi like you know if you can have something go faster time is money right so like if something happens faster then that's generally going to be good for probably the top line if I had to guess because it's it's gets out the door faster you get the product or service to customers faster um and but then there's even there's there's there's components of those that all contribute so I guess maybe tributary kpi or or something but I can very easily imagine the tree and so then there's a temporal component right so there's there's there's because things are not necessarily true at all times right whether or not there's a truck in the loading dock or whether or not the truck is in transit um but then there can there can also be Ripple effects that are disconnected so one thing you mentioned earlier was how did you word it I think like shortening the feedback cycle or the iterative cycle so like if you get the report 3 weeks later you don't necessarily know why the detention was too high or the the fees were too high but if you connect that to the gate times so how do you connect it's because it it seems to me like one of the hardest things is not just laying out all the kpi that or all the measurements that are available but maybe identifying measurements that aren't being made um and then correlating those across time and space so let's talk about that because that that I think is um and if you've got any stories about that that could be really interesting yeah I mean that that's a concept called short interval control which is you know the the if if you're trying to steer a ship and if that ship you know you only measure it every four hours and if there's a there's a deviation in that you know or there's a drift in that by measuring only four hours you could be off by a mile or two miles right if if you if you correct it course corrected and if you measure where you are maybe every minute or or so your drift is going to be much lower and I mean that's always necessarily true like there's always the right frequency for measurement for some some things there's Al also such a thing as measuring too often but in in general if you match the frequency to how often a something is changing or some kpi is changing then the short interval control will enable you to better control it uh and take proactive steps to address it in time or before Before Time that reminds me so in my past life as a infrastructure it infrastructure engineer I was obsessed with best practices and detecting problems before they were problems and so I would have you know services that would you know look at all the systems that I was responsible for and show me alerts and errors and stuff and I don't know why but for for many it people they just ignore those it's like they you have systems that have critical alerts and you know you basically react you wait until until something breaks and then the fire alarm goes off and then you scrambled and I'm like but what if you prevent the fires and so for me like one of the things that I would measure is like number of alerts number of alarms any any kpi any any errors that could be fixed and so I would have dashboards and I'm like the correct number of Errors is zero so how can I Trend towards zero because it's like and you know when when people would first start you know when we'd first set up a dashboard it' be like you know 8,000 alarms and it's like well that's too overwhelming it's like well one of those is going to blow up though so let's how do we get that to zero so that that's kind of like an operational view of like okay what is the correct one measure the right thing and then take action about it and of course that's that's my my past life but I I appreciate talking about like the interval control like shorter interval controls and optimizing how often do you look at this and so for me I would I would have a report generally once a week but I'd have a dashboard that I'd check every morning just to make sure things are moving in the right direction that's excellent excellent stuff let's let's move to the people side of it so a as I'm as I'm talking to more systems thinkers what I'm realizing is that systems thinking is is first and foremost people thinking is is kind of one of the things that I'm learning and so you know you start with the executive leadership you start with the key stakeholders all the Departments so you've got you've got some you've got some natural silos right the accounting people don't necessarily need to be talk talking to the the doc workers it's your job to to go across those silos um so you've got you've got a lateral view as well as a vertical View and an outside view but you're talking to a bunch of different people and then you've got outside vendors and so I guess let's start at the beginning you you mentioned a little while ago about making sure that you get Buy in at the leadership level um and then it goes goes from there so what are all the other stakeholders and the relationships and kind of the the people systems aspect of all this so I think breaking those silos is is is really critical breaking silos of communication across departments is is is super important in my opinion so after we kind of get leadership Buy in after the communication is is done uh we then make sure that those work streams that are assigned for each each area or each department is Staff with people that are that have either you know going by the Ry principal who's responsible for some something who's accountable for something who needs to be consulted and who needs to be informed so we got to we make sure that there's at least one of each representation there in that in that in that workstreet so if if you know if if you need to make sure that uh shipping needs to be consulted while you're trying to address uh production then we got to make sure or we will make sure that there's a person that represents shipping in those discussions and whether they are part of that on a daily basis or maybe we just involve them on a you know as needed basis or maybe once a once a week but we got to make sure that that representation is there because without that representation uh there's there's a big disconnect and the same thing goes for you know more more more and more these days you got to have it buying you got to have it involvement you got to have you know technology involvement because it's it's really hard to separate out these days any anything that you you're doing in the factory or in a uh in a company without make without it involvement so that's kind of another big area we want to make sure that there is Buy in on all sides before you kind of move too far down the down the road there I really I I had never heard it described like that because typically in the past when I have engaged with you know aacy matrix it's usually a particular system or a particular business domain but what you're saying is you actually apply the racy principle to the work stream to each step of of the process and so what you're talking about is actually creating creating structural lines of communication by looking okay who who at each part of the workflow or the workstream needs to be responsible accountable consulted or informed about a particular thing and this so This goes from top down left to right across silos so is that is that part of well let me ask it this a different way when when you're you know doing a doing a a consultation and you're trying to solve a problem how do you identify when there is communication should be happening that isn't because that I think that's probably one of the most perennial problems in businesses how do you know how do you make sure the left hand is talking to the right hand at any given you know step of the process in in the US this has been in operations Consulting this has been around for almost 70 years so I didn't invent it you know none of the companies that I worked with invented this but there's a principle called management operating system and management operating system essentially is is not technology it's it's a system of making sure that there is communication at the right levels at the right frequency and that there's there's a complete Loop so it's almost starts you know in the olden days they would really start start with a brown paper on the wall and then start putting together here are the meetings here are the levels here's the the frequency at which you know at which these meetings occur so you you start with like corly uh monthly weekly daily meetings and then kind of draw a full loop of of those meetings and and what are the inputs and outputs of those meetings so when you kind of do that exercise it's often very easy or very apparent to look at what's missing and you might you know you might look at it and go you know there's supposed to be forecasting forecast control report Etc and I'm missing the report Loop for this meeting at this level so maybe we need to actually install a meeting that that communicates that back to the right stakeholder so maybe there's a planning meeting that's missing for actually for for procurement right you're not procuring at the right time because you don't know what your forecast is and maybe that's a meeting that was missing maybe there's redundancies in meetings where you have two or three meetings that are doing the exact same thing except they're in different silos and we we might go look at that and say why can't we combine these meetings where you're talking about the same thing and you look at the same reports but why have one for sales Ops one for ship shipping one for procurement one for production while when they are talking the exact same thing so this should be just really maybe one meeting and and that's that's a way of of kind of identifying some of those gaps as well as redundancies in that communication and again like I I didn't invent it it's been around for at least the last 70 years in the US in the operations Consulting space now meetings are are often considered the bane of people's existence I remember my my boss at my last job my last corporate job he showed me his calendar once and it was back-to-back meetings all day every day almost and to me that seems like there were some redundancies almost certainly if you're spending all day talking to people unless it's your job um but as as a manager of of people I imagine it wasn't his not supposed to be his full-time job but what so what kind of what you're saying is that there are there is an appropriate an optimal amount of meetings with the correct stakeholders so like I guess what are all the key inputs because you have to have the right people in the room talking you have to have the right Cadence or frequency um you have to have a correct agenda like you said maybe it's a forecasting or several other agendas so what are all the correct structural inputs or structural decisions to have an optimal meeting because it it sounds like it serves a very critical purpose in operations so there so what are what are all the key inputs first of all we what we do is we we have like a almost like a objective or a goal for the meeting so we create like this small PowerPoint slide or or a Word document that that states here's the goals of the meeting Here's the the the people that are in attendance here's the inputs that you need to bring here's the output of that meeting and and essentially you know that that's kind of the almost like a like a yeah that that's the first step you set a goal and then you make sure that those goals are those objectives are actually followed through you have the right people in the room they bring the right sets of inputs you have the right discussions and everything is is is measured so it's not just a free discussion where I I just want to talk about you know safety issues you got to have some in you know some objectives of what are talking about why are we talking about this and what are we trying to achieve out of that and making sure that it's connected to that objective that's set you know I would call it a meeting Charter a charter of a meeting and then follow that Charter to make sure that the meeting is essentially a success and then initially we would also measure the meeting Effectiveness by kind of having a check box that that says you know where the right people in the room where the object is called followed where did the meeting start and stop on time Etc so you kind of have a meeting effect in a score that you also provide to coach and help imple you know help improve those meetings but you know if if I may kind of Veer off track a little bit the the what I'm really excited about is I think there's a and that's what I've been doing now for the last four years or so there's a lot of artificial intelligence that can help in many of these aspects and that's to me is super exciting because now you can take inputs that are that were primarily just people talking and convert it into nice summaries that you can now actually have maybe an llm analyze and figure out you know here's the inputs here's the outputs what decision could be potentially made from it I'm not saying the llm you should have the llm make a decision necessarily right right away but maybe it can help you actually figure out like here's the decisions that that could be potentially made and then you have a human in the loop that says yeah that's right or that that's not not right and now you know maybe initially you cut down the meeting from 160 minutes to 15 minutes and eventually maybe you eliminate that all together because maybe you just just people just send voice transcripts or the right inputs in various formats it could be Excel files PDF files Etc and to me that's that's the real the next boundary of what's what's really exciting about all of this how how do you combine like operations with with technology to take it to the next level one way of looking at AI particularly from an operation's perspective it's an it's an information processor it's it's a tool that can help either process information or participate in automation or a little bit of both is is a good way of looking at it so pivoting pivoting to that topic like where do you see it going what are you working on like what's what like have you seen it materially affect outcomes yet or are you kind of working towards that where's where is AI right now so okay just taking a quick step back I I think like you know in my so 20 20 so years in in management consulting and then seven or so years in like applying AI to kind of solving these problems what I realized is there's a big disconnect typically in people who come from a pure business background and people who come from a pure technology background and they often don't talk the same language they don't they often they don't even have the same goals and what we've been trying to do for the last I would say seven years is trying to bring those people together and and say okay if you try to achieve an objective of you know the the example like improving truck detention or another example is we improve productivity of number of bags produced for a food manufacturer in the Pacific Northwest and whatever those objectives are if you put on your business hat and you put on a technology hat what are the different things that that you're seeing as as an as from that perspective that if you combine you know you you get better results so just to give an example for for the food for the food manufacturer if if you're if you were doing this this this is a project we did about three years ago and if we had done this project maybe 10 years ago we would be looking at pure purely from a perspective of you know what are the down times what are the people bottlenecks what the process bottom legs Etc and and that's a good good way to start that's a good point of point of starting but because we had also put on our technology hats we realized hey wait a second there's actually information that is stored inside the pl or the production line that has the weight of every single bag that's produced on the network and the time and the time stamp so from that we can actually get down to the to the the second level and and down to the grams or what that bag weighs and any deviation from it and when was it produced so from that we were able to actually calculate all of the components of what we call oee overall equipment Effectiveness that measures basically rate quality and rate quality and availability inverse of downtime so having a perspective of where we were actually able to use technology to to get that information and then the next part was actually training a simple deep learning algorithm to figure out if you have a bunch of sensors what are you know can you predict your quality downtime or quality and downtime in the next half an hour or next two hours uh so that was like again very basic but this is about three years ago and but but when you have that combination of of having the business perspective business View and a technology view the results are much better in my opinion than anything that you can do individually usually so to to answer your question which is where is AI today I think what AI is missing is the true business applications in Industry at least you know I can't speak for other countries but in North America US and Canada I feel like other than the big boys you know the apples and Walmarts and Amazon we are the rest of the the manufacturing sector or you know industry is is is lagging behind and in their adoption and that adoption there there's several causes of this I mean I could talk for another two hours on that but I I think that you know the fundamental disconnect is is again starting with you have the people that are have a a business View and you have people that have a tech View and it's very hard to bring that that that those people together so one of the things that that I'm doing or we are doing in my company is is trying to build that from the ground up which is we have people that are operations experts and AI experts and and Technology experts and kind of trying to bring that from the ground up and say how do you look at this holistically as a problem and and and identify what are the business aspects that we can that we should be looking at and what are the technology aspects of having some of these Advanced Technologies at our disposal that were literally science fiction 10 years ago right and and and now you know like as an example I can I can process like 80,000 customer service records to get insights from you know what what somebody what the market is saying about their products or saying about their their issues and it's just such valuable insights that would have taken literally hundreds of thousands of dollars several months and and a ton of people to get that kind of information even 10 years ago and now you can do that literally with you know with just like you you put like a simple model there and you get the you get the result there and that's true for almost every that I can every single business application that I think that I can think of so if you're trying to reduce downtime you're trying to increase improve quality improve the forecast when you take that combination of you know what if I I can look at my last five years of of historical demand and train a train a simple ml algorithm on it that takes other things as inputs besides just the last historical value and we find that that gets much better results in terms of you know mean mean absolute percentage error or however you measure accuracy then if you were to just look at yeah I'm just going to look at the last two years and do some maybe some moving averages or you know some and that's what lot of companies use so even the more sophisticated ones today they they they still you'd be surprised that they still for forecasting they use things like moving average expon moving average maybe the some of the more sophisticated ones use arima that's the auto regressive integrated moving average uh but then you know there's not lot of companies that are going Beyond using historical records to do that I'm I'm I'm digressing but if I take a step back I think what I was trying to the main point I was trying to make is that combination of using technology at the right levels in the right areas to to to get information that is uh that is more objective so to to reduce the subjectiv subjectiv subjectivity in that information and then bring the right set of people together that are looking at it is what is the impact of having an llm for analyzing my meetings or analyzing my my contracts that you know previously took me 10 days to process now I can analyze it and get the results in in in like literally five minutes right if if you combine that then you're going to get much better results because now you you can start to re refine your business process around that new technology so you got those views that says okay you know if I remove this bottleneck I can make my business process different and and I completely change it knowing what is possible so that that combination of knowing the technology enough to be able to combine it with with the business process and having a a right level of understanding of the all of the business itself of of the business process of the business the the the the the details about the business itself that combination in my view gets gets you much better much better results and I'm I'm really excited about that because I feel like that's that's the future that combination of of this business and technology I mean there's a few really key important principles that you you outlined here so first is the hybridization or bringing together of of the tech technology perspective or the technology people and the business people because as you said they have different even even different language different goals different concerns different points of view but then you're talking about the actual implementation of AI and and getting more Telemetry and it's as as you mentioned there's many machines many workflows they all generate data or they all generate information but what one of the things that artificial intelligence can do is it can give you either the ability to interpret that data that was otherwise would have taken too long to interpret or or was too complex to interpret manually via an Excel spreadsheet and so it gives you it gives you new new sources of information new high value sources of information but really it sounds like the the main principle of what what do you do with all that information is reduce subjectivity is you know like if you've got if you've got you know a bunch of seemingly uncorrelated or maybe vaguely correlated data points train a deep deep neural network on it that will be able to discover the effects be able to discover which which variables are predictive versus which are irrelevant or spous um but then ultimately the idea is you reduce the subjectivity whether it's from the from the the factory line worker or the management whatever you know the human fallibility and you put a number to it so the key thing and then like you said you can also here what was it you said like you can have 80,000 customer reviews and then rather than rather than having you know a team of business analysts spend weeks reading all of it you have an llm read it all in five minutes several times over and you ask questions and you you correlate it and so then but that again that's that's another thing of you're reducing subjectivity because it's no longer just a marketing person reading it or a product owner reading it it's you say hey let's have this machine read all of it and then make it more consistent so uh would you is my understanding correct and that that reducing subjectivity broadly is kind of like that's what you do with the numbers that's kind of the goal of artificial intelligence here or is there more to it than that that's that's primarily that's I would say one of the goals right but then the second goal which is you know we've only been doing that part for the last I would say 8 months N9 months because obviously llms didn't exist like or at least not to that scale didn't exist like till like a year ago right approximately before chat GPD came out but I think where we are going with you know so three years ago when we started uh doing what we doing it was more about to your point reducing subjectivity looking at s different sources of data uh whether it's from a Machinery or whether it's from sensors or whether it's from you know whatever else and and trying to get more data out of it to make sure that you can make the right business decisions from that data object to business from the data I think where we what's possible in the last been possible in the last I would say you know nine months to a year with laws language models is you can now potentially use them for decision making itself and and we're not I I don't think we're there yet but that's where I think we even ually moving I mean you know one of the things that I was I found very inspiring one of your videos talked about the latent spaces on how llms are able to compress things into latent spaces and then expand on that that was that's really powerful because if you think about what that means is that in my opinion that means that there's a really good amount of understanding that's going on in the llm to be able to compress and then expand it to that that level so if you have that level of com comprehension or understanding I feel that if you have the right inputs there's no reason why you couldn't over time start to actually enable decision making right from the llm level and and that's to me that's super exciting and and again I'm not saying we should go go and you know yield control to an llm tomorrow but if you can start taking steps in that direction I think that's where in my opinion that's the next evolution of where all of this is going and now you have you know you have the right people in the mix still right I'm not saying you should take out humans at all like you should obviously have in the loop but can you actually help them make better decisions that are supplemented by using llms that actually have a good amount of comprehension and can Aid in decision making and maybe help reduce bias help provide more objectivity to it Etc okay I'm starting to to kind of grasp where you're coming from so I guess first like what kind of decisions are we talking about and then what are some of the advantages so it it sounds like uh you know reduce bias increase objectivity but basically help humans make better decisions and eventually maybe take over some of the decision- making for humans I guess presumably once machines are more consistent and consistently make better decisions but what are the kinds of decisions that you're thinking about like deciding what products to buy or deciding you know who to hire and fire like what sorts of decisions business decisions are you thinking of it's certainly not things that would affect you know humans so definitely not hiring or firing decisions but yeah but but things like you know for example right now we we talked about where you use reports and you use reports that are generated maybe daily weekly and then somebody's looking at that report and making a decision here's what I need to buy here's what I need to procure here's what I need to stock here's what I need to produce you know in supply chain in know snop Department here's what I need to do in terms of shipping those are all decisions that are currently driven by usually tons and tons of reports and meetings and all and all that and there is inherently a lot of pel necks that are represented in that in that decision framework where I'm going with this is if you have the right inputs you have the right source of information and you have llm agents that can essentially now have the you know the the the ability to look five steps or 10 steps Beyond just the most immediate decision uh why could we not have some of these reports and and automation go directly into the llm and it makes a recommendation so it's not necessarily you're not still giving it the trigger that you don't allow it to press the right button but it's basically giving you you know based on the observations you need to procure from these 10 vendors you need to stock this amount at this these these these factories and again I mean don't get me wrong I mean there are specialized software that have been doing this for last 20 years right so I'm not saying that this is not been done what I'm saying is like the ability to bypass all of that and retrofit this into companies that didn't have any of this before that's the more exciting thing I mean you always have had companies that I'm pretty sure again I'm not going to speak on behalf of any of any companies but I'm pretty sure like if you go to the the Walmarts or Amazon they have a ton of processing power that's doing all of these decision decisions right now and they've been doing it for last 10 20 years right but if you talk to a company that's I don't know 20 million or $50 million in revenue and you go and talk to them today and ask them how do they make this their decisions and how do they do this XYZ you often find it's it's still today it's all done in Excel it's all done in like maybe some basic CRM and you have people printing out reports and making decision so I'm I'm talking about right now like we have clients today that are in that boat right now and to me the exciting part is what essentially AI in general enables you to do is essentially democratized access to some of these things that would have been the reserve of very sophisticated Technologies or or very expensive technologies that would have only been accessible for for for large companies right so if you're a big company yeah you can afford to spend you know maybe $10 million on o operations optimiz optimization software that does all of this automatically but what if I could take PDF reports and what if I could take Excel reports and and and voice transcriptions convert that into essentially what something that an llm can can understand which you can very easily do these days and and have a decision that can guide some of these smaller companies at a fraction of the cost of what it would would have taken in the past to for for some of these things to to to to to do and and that to me is the exciting part like in the next two years or maybe maybe it's maybe it's going to be less than that I don't know you have the ability to really transform business across across you know the whole of North America obviously other countries as well but I can't speak for other countries I I only no experience here but that's exciting to me because now you have smaller companies even mom and pop shops you know it could be maybe they're doing five million revenues and they have a ton of information stored in PDFs that they can't really do anything with and now you can easily actually extract information from that have maybe a maybe some AI system actually ingest that and enable decision making that this person can you know can now have and they don't have to spend $5 million maybe they spend 50,000 or maybe they spend you know 5,000 a month I don't know I'm just making up a number but you know at a fraction of what the price would have been just even five years ago or 10 years ago and that's that to me is truly exciting so so I appreciate like a few key key ideas one like you said not you're not Reinventing the wheel per se these a lot of these practices are there for the companies that can afford it you know Amazon for instance they're famous for they know which products to place in which distribution centers because they look at the trends and so on but they have the data and they have the the the discipline to and by discipline I don't mean like emotional discipline but I mean they've made it a business discipline to constantly ingest that data to automate it to operationalize it um and so what you're what you're really looking forward to is getting that big Tech that Enterprise scale you know data informatics but give it put it into the hands of of everyone in in terms of whether it's an automation capability or just or even just you know reading the reports that you get on a daily basis and taking maybe maybe not taking it away from a human but empowering the people to make more informed decisions or faster decisions or better decisions or all of the above ideally um and so but you use the term I think I think you said uh decision bottlenecks um is that is that kind of a is that like one of the things that you would expect to overcome uh in the long run with AI is like maybe maybe there's you're waiting on an expert to make a decision and it takes them time or there's too many decisions to be made and so you have decision fatigue like what what what is what is a decision bottleneck and how will it how do you how do you think AI can or will like overcome that just as an example if you if you are a company that's selling some complex product or service offering and it takes you as an example it takes you and this is you know I observe this in in in some Pharma companies as an example it takes you 10 days to come up with a quote because you have to follow a bunch of you know you know steps and you to have to refer to a bunch of different sources of information so I'm look looking at some PDF here I'm looking at a SharePoint there I'm I'm trying to collect all that together and if I have a system that allows me to at least access information much quicker and compile that information to something that I can then review so you're still not eliminating the the the the the key decision maker but you are enabling them to get have access to that information better faster quicker cheaper now you can they can make that that decision or they can get that Contra that that code out much faster than before or wi you know in the opposite direction if I'm doing a if I'm doing procurement and I have to look at 10 contracts every day and I have to read through those contracts that are all maybe 50 pages each and and I'm trying to figure out you know are all the terms as I expected you know is there any deviations now you can just have you know pass through that and say he you know give me the exceptions to my standard right if there's an exception to this term from the standard you know it's Net 7 instead of net 45 or whatever it is just highlight that as an exception and maybe mark it as as here's the difference now you suddenly enable them to look through those 10 contracts in in an hour or less as compared to 10 hours right and now you you can enable you've just enabled them to make a decision quicker because they they they not spending 10 hours looking through those contracts or the same thing could be for emails you know like maybe I need to refer to you know 50 emails before in order to actually make a decision on something that that I'm trying to do because I need to read up on what was the history of what happened here or maybe I'm reading through slack messages maybe I'm reading through some notes that I've showed in my CRM if you can actually have a large language model help with that and provide a susin summary that I can use much more effectively quickly and again obviously I mean you know better than anybody else like there's a lot of issues over about hallucinations and all that biases that we need to address but in general I think as long as those issues are known and addressed it helps to it this would be a step in the right direction because now your decision making abilities to people from data that previously would have consumed a lot of their their their mental bandwidth and the less the less you have to do that the the faster you are you can be at at decision making I mean I know people who you know who have like 500 unread messages or 5,000 unread messages and there's no way they're going to catch up on all those email messages and there's a there's a lot of you know inherent information that's in those unread messages that they're probably they're not getting around to because it's like too overwhelming and what if you could have a system that you know just allows them to extract key elements of that in a in a nice you know easy to consume Manner and and again obviously there's a lot of like caveats to that I mean you you got to ensure that you didn't miss anything there's legal liabilities Etc but with all those caveats if you're helping them to to kind of get information faster make decisions faster I think it's going to be beneficial in the long run for for especially for the smaller smaller to midsize companies yeah so one I I love all that and it sounds like part part of it is you know consuming more information obviously reading faster and having a backlog of messages and emails to sift through um you know I'm thinking about the the people that have you know 5,000 unread and it's like like like you said there there could be critical information that they're missing in that um but one of the principles that I I've talked about for and it's been a while since I since I visited this but I call it it's called cognitive offload right and so you you you take as much mental bandwidth and you you take it away from the person and you say what is what is the AI capable of doing right now you know computers for a long time have been able to do math much faster than humans why so what we what we do is we use Excel and other things to have the machine do math for us why because math is mentally taxing but now it can do a lot of reading right and reading is also it's it's slow it can be mentally taxing not Everyone likes doing it some people even if you do like reading you have a finite amount of hours in the day and a finite amount of pages that you can read and so you know whether it's unread emails or you know legal contracts was another example so you know and and as you said if one of if if all you do with this is just have it help read read more and read faster that can result in e either better decisions or faster decisions or ideally both in in in an Ideal World so this is this is all really great so we've we've been on the call for a little while so let me let me take a step back and and and just as as we start to wind down like what did I what did I not ask or what what are what are the things that you're that you know most about or are most passionate about that we didn't get to in the in the call so far I I think you covered really most all of the most important things I I think the only thing that I would that I would add is is you know the the the possibility of of having AI really com you know to to to be utilized in in in day-to-day life more and more that's going to create in my opinion that's going to create positive effect in the long term uh in the short term that there you know there will be probably disruptions in in certain sectors but overall I think there you know in in a long-term trajectory I see this as as a very positive development and it's going to really help improve Societies in in in in general and so if if I want if if you want to kind of summarize that the way I see is this combination of of having artificial intelligence play a greater role in reducing subjectivity improving decision making reducing cognitive off offloading cognitive load I think all of those are super positive developments that that I'm excited that I'm excited about the other thing that I think we didn't address and maybe this is a maybe it's a future video for you is is how do you you know some of the things that that you have used in your videos I've been following for a while which is you know some of these concepts of latent space and how re really how capable capable llms are how do you utilize that for you know enabling even better decision making in in the long term right I mean what else can we actually give enable llms actually do or have ai do that that we are not doing today and and that that would be another you know interesting possibility to explore maybe just have one of your videos we're still and constantly discovering new capabilities and all the while the underlying technology is advancing so this time next year I'm sure we'll be talking again and there will be a whole new set of capabilities to to discuss well Rishi thanks so much for jumping in it's been incredibly Illuminating to talk to you and learn about operations management and Improvement and the Consulting side of things so thank you so much for for jumping in and and yeah I look forward to keeping in touch and seeing where all this goes so thank [Music]
