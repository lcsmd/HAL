  "transcript": "with so many settings and checkboxes and drop downs to choose from inside the network controller of ubiquity it can be really difficult to know whether or not you have your network set up correctly especially if you're new to ubiquity so in today's video we're going to go through my top 13 tips for setting up your home network in UniFi that way you have a sort of Baseline if you will for setting up your home network that you can sort of tweak from there let's get started hey guys welcome to ethernet blueprint my name is Tim trit now if you already have ubiquity products or you're new to the ubiquity world you may have noticed that their system can be a bit more complicated than anything that you buy over the shelves now this can be both good and bad on the good side it's going to give you a lot more data about what is happening inside your network and it's going to give you in most cases control over that data you're going to be able to morph and bend and shape things the way you want it however on the flip side as a negative it can be a bit overwhelming for you to even know whether or not you have your your system set up correctly so today I just want to go over some best practice tips for setting up your ubiquity home network and make you aware of some settings inside your controller that you need to have set now I love comments from my viewers it's very important for me to hear from you guys so if you have a best practice tip please leave it in the comments below so we can all learn all right before we kick things off I have a couple disclaimers first and foremost what we're going to be talking about today is my home network how I have my network set up and my needs May differ from yours you may have something special in your network or a certain kind of Technology happening inside your home that may have you turn off some of the settings that we're talking about so just kind of keep that in mind these are General best practices for a typical home network okay secondly for today's video we are going to be inside the udm pro and that means there may be some features or settings that are available to this device that are not in your devices um some of the more entrylevel uh UniFi gateways out there do have some limitations as it pertains to some of their security features and what they can do or can't do so please keep that in mind now if you are interested in learning about the ubiquity Gateway so you can figure out which one is best for you check out this video I did where I break down some of the pros and cons of each of the uh some of the new products that the ubiquities came out with very recently um that are all very good options for a home network however they differ in a certain way so I wanted to just point that out in this video there's also a link in the description all right guys let's go ahead and get started with setup tip number one and that is pre-plan your network work as best you can before you start setting it up and remember to keep it simple I see a lot of you out there get very very excited about vlans and you just want to dive in and go crazy I really do encourage you guys to start out small start out very very simple and then grow it from there remember you can always move devices into new vlans that you create down the road it's not like whatever you're creating day one has to be that way forever I've changed my network a lot of times over the over the years however when I first started I had two networks guys that was it the main Network that we kind of put all of our normal devices on and then I had an iot Network because I was wanting to learn about firewall rules and how to secure that network but still be able to communicate with it you know do you stick sonus over there do you put your smart plugs in there I was just kind of trying to learn the ecosystem and what worked and what wasn't going to work so then I could kind of grow up from there now since then I've added management vlans and Camera VLS and all sorts of things but I started out small and I recommend you guys do the same secondly when I say pre-plan I don't mean draw this thing out as like a network diagram and you have to know exactly what you want but there are probably things that you're trying to accomplish with your network um that I want you to think through from the beginning right so think about the devices you have on your network think about the things you're trying to accomplish and then what's the best way to slice up your network to get all those things remember in the beginning you can just do maybe two VLS and grow into it but you still want to sort of have a goal in mind as to where you want to go for a lot of you out there who are parents you know the idea of creating a kids network and locking that down and blocking pornography that's a great option do you want to do that day one or maybe your kids are too young just be thinking about things before you dive in and start tweaking settings and checking check boxes it will really make your life easier it'll make your network more secure and it'll make things work better um for you in the long run so big big uh setup tip is to keep it very simple and pre-plan your network okay guys so setup tip number two is very very closely related to setup tip number one and that is don't have too many Wi-Fi networks so as you guys kind of sit back and think about what you want your network to look like I also recommend to keep it very very simple for your Wi-Fi networks when you have a ton of Wi-Fi networks it can be very very difficult to know which one to choose when you're trying to connect up a device there are just going to be some devices in your home that can sort of fit into two SP spots you know iot is a very broad term cameras are a very broad term so take a smart camera that's Wi-Fi do you add it to the camera Network or do you add it to the iot network right so it can be very very difficult to sort of know where these things fit so as you're starting to plan your network and figure out how it needs to be categorized kind of work your Wi-Fi into that as well now I recommend starting out very very simple having a main Network maybe having an iot Network things of that nature similarly what I said in the beginning with tip number one um I recommend to do that with Wi-Fi 2 um they're just having a lot of networks broadcasting can make things very very confusing as to what devices go where all right guys we're going to move over to the console for setup tip number three and that is to keep your console and devices up to date with official release versions now honestly guys it's up to you on how you want to do this some people like to manual manually update their equipment some people like to just set everything to Auto so the choices your let me show you where that's done at and then you can kind of set it the way you want so we'll switch over here to the console let me show you around a little bit so this is on the main dashboard I'm just going to come down here to settings I'm going to go to system and then I'm going to choose the updates tab this is the area where we would go to um for device firmware Updates this is going to be like updates on your switch and your access points and devices that you have running on your network you can see I have mine set to automatically check daily at 3:00 a.m. I am not set for early release channels that's a personal preference you're welcome to do that if you'd like and then um you can also manually check for updates right here by clicking this now this is going to help with the devices running on your network the other area you need to make sure is up to date is your console and applications actually running the software running on your um udm Pro or your your gateway that you have um so you can actually click right here to get there or you can come up here to the OS settings and go to Applications this is where it would have taken you if you would have clicked that link you can see I have two running here Network and protect these are the applications I have running I'm running the official release Channel but if I wanted to sign up for any of these I could get early um updates if I wanted to um I like the official version and you can see I have mine set to automatically update um checking every day at 3 so go to both of these places make sure you have your system set the way you want because you want to make sure you're you're getting updated whether you do it manually or automatic uh is up to you but you want to make sure your system is at least set up the way you want as it pertains to updates all right guys so let's go ahead and continue in our configuration with setup tip number four and that is to make sure your automatic backups are set up now backing things up is very very important we want to make sure that you have your automatic backups set the way you want them set and in just in case you have an emergency and you have to rebuild something it's nice to have these they will save your bacon and it stops you from having to rebuild everything again from scratch so let's go over to the configuration I'll show you where that's done all right so we are over in the network application again you can see I'm going to go down to my settings gear go to system and then I am going to go to backups now I can download a backup right here if I want to um and you can see I have mine set to automatically backup this I think is a worth setting in your system and a good way to go go um the other thing is if you don't want weekly you can click the reschedule button here maybe you want daily backups and you want to keep 30 of them uh because you're making a lot of changes to your system and you just want to make sure that you can restore back to a good working point the point is is you can set this the way you want it and then once you have your system all set up then maybe just back it off to weekly or whatever uh you know and and move away from that but minor set is weekly I have it done on Sundays 2:30 a.m. I keep an three backups but I could keep keep more I could keep four backups if I wanted to and I just keep my settings only um instead of like all my logs and all the other stuff you can keep you can restore and back up all that stuff as well um that's up to you um preferably I only really need my settings and so that's how I have mine set um then we need to be able to back up our console um so let's go over to that so we're going to click on the console settings and it's actually down here in console settings and you can see right here system config backup um I just have the Auto weekly checkbox checked you can take a a a backup now if you want to do uh a current backup if you want to and the restore buttons here as well not as many options in here you can see I can't configure this it's either Auto it's either backing up weekly or it's not so if you want more backups um more frequently than weekly you'd have to come in here and manually grab them but this is going to be able to be able to restore your OS console back to the way it is right at that moment in time um and so a lot of times what I'll recommend is if you're going to go make a change to some settings maybe you go take a backup quick manually save that to your computer go ahead and make your changes and if it breaks something then you can always restore to the way it was right before you made that change so guys just know that these tools are here for your benefit um ubiquity has done a very very good job of the backup and restore process when you set up your new console they syn to the cloud so you can actually say I want to restore from this specific backup and it'll just put everything right back to normal it really really does work awesome um and I've had to use it I mean I I know personally I've had to use it and I think you guys will really appreciate having these checked especially if you're just starting out and making configuration changes it's good to be able to make sure you have a good working backup all right guys setup tip number five is to name your network devices name your devices in your system this is a troubleshooting step it is an extra step but it's a very easy thing to do and it can make troubleshooting things much much easier especially as it pertains to Wi-Fi and here's what I mean so let's go over here to the to our controller we're going to go into our devices right here and you can see that I have mine named they are not named Frank Susan and Mary they are actually named based on their location and the reason this is important is if you are trying to troubleshoot maybe a poor wireless connection it's nice to be able to tell what device that is actually connected to when you first adopt your your access points they're all going to say what model they are so like these are you know U6 LR so it would just say U6 LR U6 LR U6 LR and you you wouldn't know which one it is um so I recommend naming them um and that way if you have to troubleshoot a client or something like that you know which device which access point it's connected to if you have an access point go down you know which one is down um it just makes everything much much simpler to have these named um and I'm going to show you how to do it so you're going to click on the access point like I said this would just say U6 LR and you're going to come over here to settings and it's right here at the top basement AP this is also where you kind of tweak some of your settings but the naming part of it is done right here and this is where and I usually recommend naming it based on its location master bedroom living room basement whatever it's going to make it much easier for troubleshooting down the road now if there is a little trick if you already have them all up and you haven't named them and you want to name them after the fact you do not have to go unplug them from the switch and see which light turns out uh ubiquity has a locate feature so this is actually really cool um you can click on the one you want to try and locate you will have to walk around your house but if you go over here to settings and go clear to the bottom you can see there is a locate button here so if I do locate what that's going to do is going it's going to make the light start blinking on my access point so I know this is that particular one so right now my basement access point has the light blinking on it um and then when you're done make sure you choose stop locating and then go to the next one and locate that one so um because if you don't hit stop locating it'll continue to Blink Forever Until you tell it to stop so this makes it very very easy to name your devices um same thing with your cameras if you guys do have cameras this is more focused on the UniFi Network space but guys name your devices it will make troubleshooting much much easier for you down the road all right guys so setup tip number six is to label your switch ports and I know the picture sort of implies I mean label your patch panel but some of you might not have patch panels and while I do love labels on a patch panel that's not what I'm talking about here I'm actually talking about labeling it in the configuration so let me show you where that's done at so if we click over here into our um console I'm on the network application you can actually get to this um area two different ways you can actually go into your devices click on your switch and then go to Port mapper over here or you can just click on ports on the side and you got this nice little drop down so you can see all your switches in here um I'll just focus on the 48 Port switch here now as you can see ubiquity does a really nice job of matching up ubiquity devices and showing you where they're plugged in and giving you a really nice visual for stuff that's happening on the network what I'm talking about though is taking things a little step further you can see if I click on Port two right here it just says Port two um what I'm talking about is actually giving this port a name as to what is plugged in there so if I unselect this and click in that you can see this is my living room AP um this is my Philips Hue Hub okay um I got my fir Walla over here so it just makes it much easier because if something gets unplugged or you need to move some cables around um maybe you bought some pretty patched cables and you want to unplug everything and replug everything you got to you want to know where everything goes and so it's nice to be able to um have your ports labeled it just makes things much much easier um in a troubleshooting step yes it is an extra step I will agree with you all there but I've just had to save my bacon so many times um with you know moving cables around or whatnot I think it's an important step and it is definitely something I recommend especially if you're getting a nice network setup like this to label it and get it um set up the way you like all right guys setup tip number seven we're going to take this documentation a step further we're going to identify your client devices now this is probably the lengthiest or the hardest of all of them um especially if you reuse your same Wi-Fi name and password and all your devices just kind of connected again um sometimes it can be difficult in ubiquity to find out what's what but with a little bit of diligence I'm sure you can get there let me show you where to do that at and how to do it so if we go over to our client devices this is what we're talking about the actual specific devices in our Network um again when you're troubleshooting something it's nice to look at at this and be like okay here's my Canon lexark printer or my Canon printer it is connected to my basement AP which is where it's located that's a good thing um here's its IP address you know what you're looking at inside the network it just makes it much easier to identify Rogue devices and things of that nature now ubiquity does its best to try and identify devices it does pretty good with Apple devices and it might and like a switch and things of that nature sometimes it knows printers and sonies um but you know smart plugs and things like that usually just show up as a MAC address and so you know you might have to go unplug them and look at the label on the bottom and get the MAC address which is right here um and then be able to identify that device which by the way I'm going to show you a couple little tricks to do this first off the MAC address isn't always listed so you need to come over here and you can click on columns and then make sure the MAC address column is listed that will help you identify devices when you're first starting to do this okay so that's kind of step one once you get the MAC address identified and you know okay I need to change this uh to a Canon printer or whatever you click on it it may show a MAC address in the name here too and we'll go over here to settings and then you're going to give it a name so in the settings area that's where you actually name it you'll scroll down at the bottom and you'll choose save you have to choose save before doing this next step then as an additional thing and this is kind of something I like to do maybe you don't want to do it that's fine but I like to change the icon so if you come over into this area right here you can see I can change icon so if I click on that I can come down here and search for Canon printer okay so here's a Canon printer right here so it may not have your model that's okay it actually may actually have your model some of them they have quite a few in here but I'm going to choose Canon printer and I'm just going to say change and now my little icon changes and you can see I know I'm looking at a printer yes this is tedious yes it takes a little walking around and figuring out what IP addresses are and Mac addresses are and stuff like that but when it comes to troubleshooting your network having the stuff this stuff filled out is really really helpful um and something else too it you can sort your devices up here by Wi-Fi devices or wired devices so if you have a mix and one of the devices you're looking at um is a wired device you can kind of narrow your search um down a little a little bit so um it's it's kind of it's kind of nice now some of you guys may have just endless smart devices and it's just you know what I'm not going to pull apart light switches and and things of that nature I completely understand that this is might be an additional step but again I just find that when you're troubleshooting something to make sure that device is connected to the proper access point which now has a name um and is on the right Network which is shown over here it just makes things very easy or easier to troubleshoot and that's why I recommend doing it but it is up to you on how you go about it all right guys so setup tip number eight is to secure your network with firewall rules now I wish I could show you guys how to make firewall rules as part of this setup tip I do have another video where I take you guys step by step in how to set up a very Baseline firewall setup in your um udm and I highly recommend you check that out there'll be a link in the description but one of the big reasons of owning a nicer ubiquity system like this is to be able to separate your networks with vlans and then create firewall rules to create some security between your networks I mean that's the reason you spend a little bit more and get something like this and so um I highly recommend don't leave your network as a flat Network go ahead and create some firewall rules now I'm not going to show you how but I will show you where you need to do that at and so we'll actually be over here on the network we're going to go down into our uh settings gear and then we're going to go to security and then your firewall rules are actually set up right there now yours might look like this when you first click over there um it's got this simple and Advan so uh the advanced view shows you a little bit more about what's going on so these are mine right here and my video that I was talking about a minute ago it shows you how to set up a very very nice Baseline if you have iot um it goes into setting up your main Network an iot Network maybe a guest Network it talks about how to actually create the firewall rules to do that and is very very step by-step great for beginners um but guys set up some firewall rules let's build some security in your network you'll be glad you did it's just going to automatically protect you thing protect you from outside threats and the world is full of them nowadays and so I highly recommend setting up firewall rules in your network all right guys we're going to continue on the security Trend here with setup tip number nine and that is to enable your built-in security features now if you remember in the beginning I did tell you that your system might have less features than the udm pro depending on which Gateway you have but let's go dive into the console and let me show you where they're at and then you can take a look and get them set the way you want so we're going to go over here we're going to go down to settings um and then we're going to choose security from the left and then I'm just going to stay in the general tab here and right here in the middle is kind of where we're talking about now some of the gateways have abbreviated version of this so go set things the way you feel you'd like it set in your house this is how I have it set at mine so I have my suspicious activity set to advance because I'm only having it look in these two networks if you set it to auto um it will you know just turn them all on all the VLS on which is fine um but this is how I have mine set up and then under filtering mode I have notify and block enabled again I believe the auto just has it set to notify I want it to go ahead and take care of the things for me I don't want to um you know have to worry I'd rather just have it block something if it blocks something it's not supposed to then I can troubleshoot that but I I it's going to know what's bad out there and I'm just going to trust that it takes care of it for me plus it's notifying me if it's blocking something so you know I can troubleshoot as necessary detection sensitivity right here um again I recommend out the box choosing high but you can even customize your list and check the things you don't want maybe do some toric at your house or you go to the dark web on tour or something like that um by all means set them the way you uh want it set but I have everything set by default I just want to just keep things as clean as possible um I also have my dark web Blocker on and my block known malicious IPS you can see there is a security detection allow list down here so you can add things to um allow through if you need to create some exceptions but this is where you would go to turn on and enable some of those additional security features that are built into your system and and I highly recommend having these turned on all right guys so setup tip number 10 is to turn on your notifications now I like being notified when something is going on and ubiquity does give you the ability to customize your notifications so it will tell you things that you want to hear and I'm just going to show you where to get where to take a look at that so you can set it up the way you'd like so again back over in the console we're actually going to go down over into the system log this is where they actually put the notifications at and you can see there's this push notification setting right there and this is where you can go ahead and adjust your settings now they might be turned off by default then then so you just would turn them on and then you have the choice here between the Bell icon and the email envelope so this will email the account that you're logged into with these alerts you can have it do both or you can just have it do the alert which basically if you have the um UniFi app installed on your phone your phone will actually just give you a drop- down notification like it does for a text message or something like that which is what I recommend doing and as you can see that's pretty much what I have set in here um is just to have the app notify me but there's a lot of good updates in here to to kind of look at here um some of the big ones for me are to I want to know if I have a device go down so if my if an access point goes down I want to know know about it um I want to know if it has an IP address failure you know something's going on um but you can see there's some stuff in here that I don't use I don't care about using backup power I don't have any of that stuff set up in there um I'm not too worried about DNS issues I want to know about a switch issue if I have some kind of switch issue I want to know about it um I want to this is where that like our security detections right detection and prevention I want to know if it blocks something okay I want it so I can go look at it but there's you as you scroll down you can get these set the way you want so this is one area that you're going to want to go to the second area is over in your OS console and it is also in the system log and there's a push notification setting here and now this is more like physical stuff happening on your OS on your console self so hard drive failure I want to know about that hard drive issue detected I want to know if I'm if my drive is starting to go bad um but I don't need to know if a hard drive was installed you know things of that nature I I I don't have people who work on my own stuff it's going to be me I'll know if there's a hard drive installed um I like to know about updates when they were installed when they you know so because I told you earlier I leave M set to Auto I like to know when that stuff is happening but some of this other stuff I don't really need to know about um admins added or any of that stuff I am the admin so I'm too worried about it but your situation may dictate otherwise so I highly recommend having your notifications on guys have your system going out and doing the searches but then also letting you know about them okay now one other thing I you should probably check to make sure is set um to make sure so if you are using the email notification there's an area you need to make sure is set so we're going to go over here back into the network go into the settings gear and I believe it's under system here under Advanced and you're going to want want to make sure this is set right here email Services unless you have your own custom SNMP server um that you want to use which that's fine it will if you check this it'll do that but the SSO email will basically allow your email notifications to work if that is checked and so you're going to want to make sure that's checked on your end it might be off by default I can't remember what the default setting is but if you need to if you do plan on using the email notifications make sure this setting is set right there all right guys so set up tip number 11 is to start with automatic and then adjust now what do I mean by this I have a lot of things set to Auto on here and I recommend that you guys do the same especially when you're just starting out is to recommend I recommend just kind of keeping things set up the way ubiquity recommends them um there are a few exceptions and I'll get to that a little bit later but for the most part when you are setting up a network or you're setting up you know some of your Wi-Fi stuff in here guys you can see there's a lot of check boxes in here that are unchecked um I recommend just kind of leaving this stuff alone in the beginning um again with a few exceptions but for the most part ubiquity does a pretty good job of not turning on the things that it that it doesn't need to turn on for you to have a successful deployment of your network um don't get overwhelmed with what every little check box is now there are a few optimizing things that I'll recommend and I'll do that here shortly but at the same time don't overd do it yourself trust me you guys you can get overwhelmed with what all the little boxes are I've been in network and it for a long time and I don't fully uh know what every little checkbox inside the ubiquity uh ecosystem means they you know sometimes they have different names for things and so what ubiquity calls it maybe Cisco called it something different which is what I was kind of raised on um but at the end of the day uh don't don't go in there and start checking all the boxes because you think you need them checked typically I recommend start with what what ubiquity kind of has already checked and then tweak from there it will make your lives a lot easier as you're trying to get things going if you're not researching what every one of these little check boxes are okay guys so setup tip number 12 is going to sort of uh combat what I just said in in setup tip number 11 and that is to optimize your Wi-Fi settings now typically I think you're okay if you set up and leave things set to Auto you're not going to go wrong here but there are a couple settings that I recommend you set in your Wi-Fi that I think will give you a better experience and so I want to show you what those are um um here as part of setup tip number 12 so let's head over to our console here we're going to start over in the Wi-Fi settings themselves and so I'm just over in settings and Wi-Fi I'm just going to choose one of my networks here not going to set up a new network for this so you can see I have my iot network here and it's delivering both 2.4 and 5 GHz I've left most of this stuff you know set to default I have my VLAN setup in here okay um but one thing that's usually checked by default is this band steering now band steering is a really interesting setting and it typically doesn't hurt things but what it does is is if you have a device that's capable of both 2.4 and 5 GHz it's going to try to force that device to use 5 GHz because that is the faster more reliable um band Spectrum to use however I find a lot of simple smart devices like smart plugs and stuff like that really struggle if this setting is set you'll go in you'll be setting it up you'll type in the Wi-Fi password correctly to get it online and it just says it can't connect it just keeps selling you it can't connect and a lot of times that's caused by this band steering even though that device is not capable of 5 GHz for some reason the system tells it to try and use it and it just doesn't know what to do and so it just never gets through the setup process so I typically recommend turning off band steering I think devices like cell phones and tablets and things that can do both 2.4 and 5 already do a pretty good job of choosing the 5 GHz the faster the faster Network um in general and if you notice here um I also have an iot 5G only Network so if you need to force a device to use um 5 GHz you can create a 5 GHz only and not worry about band steering it's irrelevant at that point because if a device is only 2.4 capable it won't even be able to see this network at all anyway so if you're streaming and or something like that doing it on Wi-Fi creating a a a 5G only network is a really nice way to be able to force those devices to choose 5 GHz every time but I don't recommend the band steering um aspect the other one I recommend checking is fast roaming that's typically unchecked by default and I just really have not run into a problem where unchecking fast roaming has fixed the issue I think most devices that roam around a house sell phones tablets even some laptops and stuff of that today um are typically fast roaming capable and they just do a decent job they don't get frequent disconnects so I'd recommend checking that I think it helps devices kind of move from AP to AP a little faster the second area that we're going to optimize is actually in our access points so we'll go over to devices I'm going to choose my basement AP here now you would have to do this in the individual APS um themselves and so you might have to do this a couple times but we'll click over in the settings and basically what we're going to be looking at here is the Channel width Now by default when you adopt a an access point these are U6 lrs like I mentioned the 2.4 Channel width will be set to 20 and the 5 GHz will be set to 40 now I think ubiquity plays it a little bit too safe here um and I think by bumping up your Channel width you're going to get better Wi-Fi speeds um in your home and so you know I recommend putting the 5 GHz at 80 and the 2.4 at 40 now one thing I will point out here is that by doing this you're actually allowing your your access point to use more of the spectrum to communicate and it gives better throughput but if you live in a high dense Wi-Fi area like a like an apartment building or something where there's just Wi-Fi in all directions setting a setting like this could hurt you because you do leave yourself more susceptible to interference because you're using more of the spectrum so um maybe set it try it see make sure you don't have any problems and if you have to set it back you can always dial it back back a little bit but this is going to give give you faster WiFi speeds in general in your home and let's face it we all want our Wi-Fi to go as fast as possible um and just for Grants here let me show you the living room U7 I have a U7 Pro that I bought cuz I was just kind of playing with it if you go into the settings there you can see I got 40 5 GHz goes up to 240 and then my 6 GHz goes up to actually 320 so this is how I have my Wi-Fi 7 device which has the new 6 GHz band enabled on it set you can see I'm still not going above 80 even though I have the ability to and the reason for that is is because when you get up to the 160 range you start using what they refer to as DFS channels and not all devices in your network are compatible with using DFS channels and so you could get some devices that can't communicate or or or throw errors so typically this is where I recommend leaving your 5 GHz unless you need to dial it back because of interference but as you can see the numbers are getting pretty crazy and by the way when you see a speed test on a on a Wi-Fi 7 or 60 device and they're pulling gigabit speeds it's because they have all this stuff enabled and tweaked and they're in a perfect environment that's how they're getting those speeds they're opening up their Channel width um you know wide open so they're using all of it at the same time so I I typically recommend um setting these settings now as it pertains to power and my channel I think you're probably okay to leave it set to Auto ubiquity I think does a pretty good job of this there are of course a few exceptions if you have a lot of access points maybe eight or more it's probably in your best interest to go and set the channels manually so you don't so you can dictate the overlap and then also on the power typically I leave it as Auto but you might have an outdoor access point that you need to ramp up the power turn it all the way up or even turn it down I turn them down a lot of times so they don't interfere with my interior devices a lot of times my outdoor access points are just broadcasting around a swimming pool or a fire pit or something they're not shooting 4 miles down the road and so typically I'll turn the power down because there's no obstacles in the way you're going to be able to connect okay but I don't want an interfering with my devices and my Wi-Fi inside my house so sometimes I if I have an outdoor access point I'll turn down the power but I think you're probably safe just leaving it as Auto they do a pretty good job so guys optimize your Wi-Fi you will have a better experience um again just keep in mind these are General recommendations and some of the some of the cautionary things I mentioned too could hurt you so you might not be able to leave it set that way depending on your environment all right guys so the last tip I have for you is setup tip number 13 and that is to turn on mdns multicast DNS to help with network discovery across vlans so let me show you where the settings at I get asked all the time well what happens if I have vlans and I have things like a chomecast or you know I want to airplay to a different VLAN so let me show you the setting I typically put Point people towards to turn on so if we go over into our settings and we go into I believe it's under networks and right here multicast DNS so under just the the networks I didn't click into a network I just went into my Global network settings right here you can see this multicast DNS and if you read the thing here it says allows multicast traffic to transmit across multiple networks we recommend this feature when using AirPlay or chomecast and so this allows you to have you know a Chast on the iot network and still be able to control it and and Discover it from your main Network and so typically I recommend turning on multicast uh DNS for the vlans that need to communicate back and forth now you can just turn them all on if you want to um but you can see I have my home network here which is where my devices would be like my cell phones or my tablet or whatever and then I have my iot network which is where I would typically have those kind of devices so I have mine optimized with that those two you might have a couple different networks that you need to tr Traverse across uh but so it may be a little bit different in your setup but this multicast DNS can really help with that sort of communication now I am going to put a little caveat here as it pertains to Sonos Sonos is kind of a special deal it's really not designed when they built Sonos it's really designed to be on a flat Network it's not designed to be on a network with vlans I've talked to their support many times even though you have everything set set up correctly uh they just there's things built into the inner workings of Sonos that just make it not work very well in a multi VLAN sort of environment so I know Sonos is probably seen as a vulnerability probably seen as more of an um a um iot like device uh that has vulnerabilities and things like that but I just really haven't found a set of perfect fir rules or the perfect set of settings that make Sonos work really great across VLS so for the for right now my recommendation is if you do have Sonos in your house is to go ahead and put your Sonos gear on the same network that you're using to control it which would May in my case would be my home network um yeah you maybe open up yourself a little bit but I promise your Sonos and music listening experience will be uh a better one where you might still run into problems is if you did Implement maybe a kids network and your kids cell phones are on that that VLAN and they want to be able to run the network you might have to have like a tablet or something that's on the home network for them to be able to get the sound system on or something like that um so you might again your situation really dictates it but in general whatever Network you're going to use to control sonus I recommend putting your sonus in there but that multicast DNS is a really really great setting um and will save uh you a lot of headache and troubleshooting with communicating across VLS uh in that capacity all right guys you made it you made it to the end that is my top 13 setup tips for a set setting up a ubiquity network settings you can tweak which ones to leave alone what to be thinking about I covered a lot in this video hopefully you find this helpful um I do know that a lot of my followers are new to the ubiquity world they're they're building a house they want to upgrade to something a little bit nicer we want to teach you how to do that but also teach you um not to get in over your head right start small and work your way from there it will make your lives much much easier um hopefully this helps you kind of kick things off and get you think about the right thing so like always guys like follow subscribe we'd love to hear from you leave comments what are your best practices tell the viewers um everybody's learning on this channel and we really really like sharing that knowledge with people I have really great viewers um and you guys have put in some really nice comments to help other people um we're almost up to 5,000 followers so thank you guys for the support on the channel uh I'm going to continue to make content um I enjoy this aspect of it and again hope this video was helpful to you and we will see you guys in a future video see you",
