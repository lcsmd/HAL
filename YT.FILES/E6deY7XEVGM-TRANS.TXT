  "transcript": "SCENARIOS LIKE YOU POINTED OUT,  WHAT IF THE PRESIDENT ORDERED  THE ASSASSINATION OF A POLITICAL RIVAL AND NOT IMPEACHED.  >> IT IS SO POIGNANT, THAT JUDGE FLORENCE PAN SAID, MILITARY  SECRETS AND SELLING PARDONS AND  A LITANY OF QUESTIONS.  LISTEN.  >> IF THE PRESIDENT ORDERED SEAL TEAM SIX TO ASSASSINATE A  POLITICAL RIVAL.  >> HE WOULD BE SPEEDILY IMPEACH  AND CRIMINALLY PROSECUTED.  >> BUT IF NOT, THERE WOULD BE NO CRIMINAL LIABILITY? >> AND IN MADISON AND OUR  CONSTITUTION DISCRETION AND THE  IMPEACHMENT CLAUSE ALL CLEARLY  PRESUPPOSE WHAT THE FOUNDERS  WERE CONCERNED ABOUT --  >> I AM ASKING YOU YES OR NO  QUESTION.  COULD A PRESIDENT WHO ORDERED  SEAL TEAM SIX TO ASSASSINATE A  POLITICAL RIVAL WHO WAS NOT  IMPEACHED, COULD HE BE SUBJECT  TO POLITICAL PROSECUTION.  >> IF HE WERE CONVICTED AND  IMPEACHED FIRST.  >> THE ANSWER IS NO.  >> THE ANSWER IS QUALIFIED YES.  >> I MEAN, WE ARE ALL AT THAT  POINT, WE ALL IN THE ROOM KIND  OF SAT BACK FOR A SECOND,  BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL TO TAKE A  CONFESSION OF ANY KIND IS MAJOR, BUT WHEN YOU ARE HEARING THAT  TRYING TO GO THROUGH THE  HYPOTHETICALS AND TRYING TO  FOLLOW THAT THREAD OF COMMON  SENSE AND LOGIC, WHAT STRUCK YOU ABOUT THAT MOMENT WHERE HE  ESSENTIALLY HAS A QUALIFIED YES  THAT A PRESIDENT COULD ACTUALLY  ORDER THE ASSASSINATION AND IF  HE IS NOT IMPEACHED AND  CONVICTED IMMUNE.  >> HE IS TRYING TO MAKE THE  ARGUMENT FOR JACK SMITH, AND  THIS IS WHAT JACK SMITH IS  WARNING ABOUT, ARE WE A COUNTRY  OF REPRESENTS OR KINGS.  AND TRUMP'S LAWYER IS SAYING WE  ARE A COUNTRY OF PRESIDENTS AND  THE PRESIDENT CAN ACT AS HE  WANTS OR CHOOSES AND WE HAVE  VIOLENCE.  WE HAVE VIOLENCE OF JANUARY 6th, BUT THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF CAN  DIRECT THAT VIOLENCE OPENLY AND  USING THE OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT  RESOURCES AND THIS IS FINE.  I THINK THAT WHAT IT DOES IS TO  ESTABLISH HOW DANGEROUS THIS  PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY ARGUMENT  TRULY IS, AND TO YOUR POINT,  ELIE, WE COULD HAVE HAD THE  ORIGINAL ARGUMENT SPEAKING ABOUT THE OUTER PERIMETER.  HEY, I WAS DOING MY JOB, AND TO  PROTECT ME AND THE INSTITUTION,  I SHOULD BE GIVEN THE COVERAGE  THE SAME WAY THE PRESIDENTS GET  THE CIVIL IMMUNITY AND WE SHOULD GO FURTHER, AND WHEN THE  PRESIDENT IS NOT UPHOLDING AND  FAITHFULLY EXECUTING LAWS AND IN THAT SCENARIO, HE IS COVERED AND BREAKING LAW, HE IS COVERED AND  NO ONE GETS TO SIT IN JUDGMENT  OVER THE PRESIDENT, AND THE  DANGER WAS SEEN BY THE COURT  TODAY.  >> AND SKEPTICISM TODAY, FROM  WHAT WE EXPECTED, BUT JUDGE  HENDERSON, THREE APPOINTED BY A  REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT SAID AT ONE POINT THAT SAID IT IS  PARADOXICAL THAT THE  CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO BE TAKEN  CARE OF THE LAWS TO BE EXECUTED  ALLOWS HIM TO BE ABLE TO VIOLATE CRIMINAL LAW, BUT JUDGE PAN SAID THAT NOT THE UNDERSTANDING OF  THE SENATORS, BECAUSE WHEN TRUMP WAS IMPEACH AND WENT TO THE  SENATE, A LOT OF THEM INCLUDING  MITCH McCONNELL, IT IS SOMETHING FOR THE COURTS TO TAKE CARE OF  AND SOMETHING TO BE HANDLED IN A CRIMINAL PROSECUTION OR COULD BE HANDLED IN THAT WAY.  >> YES, AND THERE ARE TWO  DIFFERENT TALKING POINTS, AND  THE PROBLEM OF THE ARGUMENT OF  TRUMP'S LAWYER SAID IT HAS TO BE AN IMPEACHMENT AND CONVICTION,  AND IT CAN LEAD TO ABSURD  RESULTS.  IMPEACHMENT IS DIFFERENT,  BECAUSE IMPEACHMENT COULD BE  POLITICAL AND BASED ON A NUMBER  OF FACTORS AND THIS IS A  DIFFERENT BALL GAME ALTOGETHER  THAN A DECISION TO PROSECUTE AND EVENTUALLY CONVICT SOMEBODY, AND THE THING THAT I KEEP COMING  BACK TO, THEY HAD AN EASIER WAY, AND TRUMP'S TEAM HAD A BETTER  WAY AND THEY BRIEFED AN EASIER  WAY, AND THEY JUST SAID THAT  WHAT HE IS CHARGED WITH IS THE  SCOPE OF THE OUTER PERIMETER OF  HIS JOB AS PRESIDENT, AND IF  THEY STUCK TO THAT, I STILL  THINK THEY WOULD HAVE HAD A  LOSING ARGUMENT, BUT NOT A  PREPOSTEROUS ARGUMENT AND  STRONGER CASE TO MAKE.  >> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, THINK  ABOUT THIS, WHAT THAT WOULD  SUGGEST IS AS LONG AS I CAN HIDE MY BEHAVIOR LONG ENOUGH TO BE IN OFFICE AND AVOID IMPEACHMENT, I  CAN GET AWAY WITH ANYTHING I  WANT AND ALL I HAVE TO DO IS TO  NOT HAVE TRANSPARENCY AND EYES  INTO WHAT I AM DOING, AND WHAT I HAVE TO DO IS WHAT I KNOW ABOUT  THE BEHAVIOR AND IF THE HOUSE  BRINGS IMPEACHMENT ARTICLES AND  MOMENT TO CONVICTION AND TRIAL  AND IF I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, I HAVE TO BIDE  THE TIME, AND THAT IS PART OF  THE ARGUMENT, BUT THERE IS A  MOMENT WHEN THE COUNSEL, I MEAN, THE SPECIAL COUNSEL FROM DOJ  SPOKE ABOUT THIS ISSUE, BUT I  WANT TO GO BACK TO A SECOND FOR  THE LAWYER OF TRUMP, BECAUSE IN  THE SOUND BITE HERE, HE TALKS  ABOUT THE IDEA THAT THE NOTION  FOR A CRIMINAL IMMUNITY NOT  EXISTING IS A SHOCKING HOLDING.  THEY ARE STANDING TALL AND  SAYING, LOOK, THERE HAS TO BE  SOME LEVEL OF IMMUNITY, BECAUSE  WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PRESIDENT  BIDEN AND OTHER PEOPLE.  LISTEN TO THIS.  >> TO AUTHORIZE THE PROSECUTION  OF A PRESIDENT FOR HIS OFFICIAL  ACTSOUOULD OPEN A PANDORA'S BOX  FROM WHICHS NATION MAY NEVER RECOVER.  COULD GEORGE W. BUSH BE  PROSECUTED FOR OBSTRUCTION OF A  PROCEEDING FOR GIVING FALSE  INFORMATION TO CONGRESS TO  INDUCE THE NATION TO GO TO WAR  IN IRAQ UNDER FALSE PRETENSES,  AND COULD PRESIDENT OBAMA BE  POTENTIALLY CHARGED WITH MURDER  FOR AUTHORIZING DRONE STRIKES ON CITIZENS ABROAD.  >> THAT IS THE QUESTION THAT  TRUMP WAS RAISING OF WHAT IS TO  BE IF YOU OPEN UP THIS PANDORA'S BOX POLITICALLY, THEN EVERYONE  IS FAIR GAME.  >> THEN THE ARGUMENT THAT JAMES  PEARCE MADE IS THAT THEN IT  WOULD OPEN UP PRESIDENTS TO  COMMIT A WHOLE HOST OF ACTS TO  GET AWAY WITH IT.  >> BOTH SIDES ARE OPENING UP A  SLIPPERY SLOPE THERE, AND THE  ARGUMENT FROM JACK SMITH SIDE,  AND SPEAKING OF HISTORY THERE,  AND THERE IS A WHOLE LOT OF TALK FROM THE PAST AND THE TALK OF  PRESIDENT NIXON WHO ENGAGED IN  THE CONDUCT AND WHAT DID HE DO? HE ACCEPTED A PARDON AND HE  TALKED ABOUT HOW WE HAVE IRAN  CONTRA INVESTIGATION, AND WE  HAVE RONALD REAGAN AND NOBODY  THOUGHT THAT HE COULD NOT BE  PROSECUTED.  SO I THINK THAT THE SLIPPERY  SLOPE ARGUMENT, AND THERE IS  SOMETHING THERE ON BOTH SIDES,  BUT IMPORTANTLY, THAT IS THE  NATURE OF ALL PROSECUTION, AND  WE HAVE BOTH BEEN PROSECUTORS  AND FOR THE SYSTEM TO WORK  EFFECTIVELY, YOU HAVE TO HAVE  THE PROSECUTORS TO ACT WITH  DISCRETION AND PERFECTLY AND  TRUE FOR EVERY SCENARIO FOR THE  EVERYDAY AMERICANS AND  PRESIDENTS AND THAT FAITH IN THE SYSTEM, IT HAS TO MAKE SENSE NO  MATTER THE DEFENDANT, SO IT IS  NOT ESPECIALLY STRONG ARGUMENT  TO SAY THAT SOMEONE COULD ABUSE  THIS, BECAUSE WE HAVE COURTS TO  REVIEW THE INDICTMENTS AND WE  HAVE STANDARDS AND BURDENS OF  PROOF AND REASONABLE DOUBT FOR A TRIAL, AND WE HAVE OTHER FAIL  SAFES THAT IS NOT A ROGUE  PROSECUTOR TO GO AFTER IT, AND  SO JACK DID HAVE THE BETTER  ARGUMENT THERE.  >> AND MINISTERIAL AND -- THAT  IS WHAT EVERYBODY WAS SAYING,  JUST SAY IT, WHETHER IT IS HIS  ACTIONS AROUND JANUARY 6th WERE  OFFICIAL ACTS AND THEY WERE  TALKING MINISTERIAL AND  DISCRETIONARY AND TAKE-CARE  CLAUSE, AND THIS IS THE  PRESIDENT HAS THE DUTY TO ENSURE THAT THE LAWS OF THIS NATION ARE EXECUTED AND ENFORCED.  BUT THIS IDEA, ELIE, OF WHAT HE  IS DOING IS OFFICIAL OR ROGUE IN SOME WAY PLAYS",
