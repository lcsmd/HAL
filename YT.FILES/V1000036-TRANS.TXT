  "transcript": "hey everybody David Shapiro here this is my inaugural uh audio-based podcast so people have been saying that I need an audio-based podcast for a while and I have decided to take the plunge now I did upload some of my episodes to Spotify um but the Spotify the Spotify platform sorry is clunky and slow and it's also very difficult to monetize um so if you see any of my stuff out on Spotify there is an impostor who is stealing some of my stuff um and I don't really care cuz he's just boosting the signal and I think he gave up anyways um but I do have an official Spotify podcast um but I'm I'm not going to maintain it so I'm going to stick with the three platforms and you're almost certainly watching this or listening to this on one of them so that's going to be patreon YouTube and substack so all three of those are monetized so if you're listening to this you are a member of one of those and I'm trying to make sure that everyone kind of gets equal access um cu all roughly the same price so on and so forth so that is kind of where I'm at um so thank you for being here and thank you for listening um the reason so one of the one of the things that I'm hoping to achieve with this is uh patreon has a like a new new subscriber like poll or whatever um I'm pretty sure it's automatic because I didn't I didn't enable this um but the the the plurality the largest single answer that was given was that people wanted to be close closer to me which I mean that is ultra flattering um and so thank you for being here and I wanted to create more opportunities for that cuz I know not everyone's going to be in Discord I am in Discord a lot and you know when you have a really large community some people kind of get shy and uh you know some of these more fireside chat things can be an opportunity to get a little bit Glimpse kind of behind the scenes or under the covers uh under the hood so to speak or Bonnet for the uh British people in the audience what do you call the hood of a car in Australia is that a bonnet as well I don't know anyways a lot of you are in Australia um I think partly because it's an English-speaking Nation but also like culturally I feel like I'm more Australian than American um just the pace of life and kind of easygoingness um I really adore all of the uh Australian um members that join all the all the people in the community uh really appreciate your your attitude um so yeah I hope to visit one day now with all that being said the Preamble is done and over with I have been taking a break from recording some YouTube videos for about a week um and this happens if you've been a fan for a while you notice that like I'll go on a like a Mad Dash where it's like I'll do a video like every day for almost a month and then I'll take you know a week or two off or slower and this is this is the just the pattern that I found that I've worked in and what I what happens is I kind of run out of material or run out of content or ideas and over the course of four to 6 weeks pretty much the entire Paradigm has changed changed in artificial intelligence and so I use that time to rest and recalibrate and so this episode is about abundance and kind of this calibration and one thing that I've noticed is there's been a whole slew of books coming out um you know from uh what was the one by Mustafa sulaman the coming wave um age of spiritual machines by Ray Kurtz granted that one's 25 years old deep Utopia by Nick Bostrom abundance by Peter diamandis and Singularity is nearer by Ray which is coming out this summer and I'm going to I'm working my way through all of these I've already read life 3.0 by Max tegmark I'm um digging into age of spiritual machines right now um deep Utopia and abundance are coming I just ordered them and then of course Singularity is nearer that is on pre-order so it's not going to come out till June um oh I also I do need to pick up some people have recommended the the the coming Wave by Mustafa sulaman um but after watching some reviews of it where like he kind of equivocates on some stuff like he's like it's going to change everything but it's not going to change your life as you know it so I think that he maybe is trying to play it safe or is afraid of kind of unpacking the full you know Monty of what's coming not really sure so I may or may not check it out but a lot of people got a lot out of that book um I'm more interested in people that are that are you know full-on futurists and just saying okay we're going through a major Revolution so what is this going to mean cuz obviously like I can do a lot of work on my own you know and reading or thinking or chatting with you know Claude and chat GPT and and chatting chatting with uh patreon supporters and people in the comments um but these are really really really smart guys who have been doing this for a lot longer than me so uh you know I I like to count myself as a smart person but I've only been in the AI space for three years and so like I'm a baby compared to some of these guys like they were like they're the ogs right um so I'm trying to get you know good fodder for thought and that led to today's episode and I don't have oh I don't I don't want to make it sound like you know oh you should prepare to be disappointed um but there's a lot to consume and so pretty much I think what is going to happen with this series is as my thoughts evolve as my understanding evolves um so too will the material that I deliver in these episodes now I did jot down a few notes of some stuff that I wanted to cover because I went from working the 9 to5 grind to the influencer lifestyle uh you know the content creator lifestyle and these lifestyles are very very different um you know I I often mention how I work harder now than I have ever worked but at the same time I also have a lot more control over my time and my schedule uh and that is that has been kind of eye-opening and I feel like it's kind of a a a a clue or a preview of what life might be like as we move towards a post- labor economy or whatever happens like I'm still you know I'm like 90% certain that labor as we know it is going away um and and you know we'll see in the long run um it could be that the nature of work changes but honestly like the economic value of most human activity is going to be near zero um I really haven't seen any evidence to the contrary now this could just be a failure of my imagination but on the on the same token what if we get to a point where 80% of people just have no job and no interest in work um in the long run so how is that going to look how is that going to feel so one of the key things is slow living and so slow living is a movement online it's uh uh very similar to Cottage core um so Cottage core is more about the aesthetic of kind of living in the countryside but slow living is kind of the whole philosophy of I'm not going to be in a rush anymore I'm not going to work by someone else's schedule and so on and so forth and so um you know some of the some of the aspects of slow living that I have adopted and my wife started this so this was back during the pandemic when we were just trying to figure out how to take care of ourselves how to manage the stress and anxiety of you know the plague going on and so she adopted first this kind of slow living mentality which was to spend more time in the kitchen um she loves baking and she would dress up and look like you know little cottage fairy um you know with her with her apron and stuff and it was a lot longer before cuz on on the surface I was like oh yeah that's a great way to live but I didn't realized the depth to which she was engaging with this lifestyle as a way to um really recalibrate her life and so um on her podcast which I will introduce her formally here soon she couldn't make it on to this episode um but she has her own patreon and her own YouTube and one of the topics that she's covering now is is decentering work and so in Western Society particularly in America I think America has it the worst um maybe next second only to Japan in terms of and and possibly South Korea in terms of work being the center of your life maybe India as well I mean there's a cluster of Nations and cultures where work is supposed to be the Hub of your life and everything is supposed to orbit around work and so decentering work is one of the things that I think think is could start happening sooner rather than later particularly if we ever see a shortening of the work week now there have been some studies there's been some bills submitted both in America and others and so imagine if you shorten the work week from you know four uh 5 days to 4 days or you know from 40 hours to 30 hours or 25 hours or whatever just by virtue of the fact that you give people a good chunk of their life back they're going to start finding other stuff to do and so then you know when you have uh more free time you're going to prioritize rest more you're going to prioritize Leisure Time more and I think what would surprise most people is that like yes you might feel lost for a little while it can take a year or more um to really fully adapt and acclimate because even though I became a full-time YouTuber over a year ago now it's only been in the last month or two that I really kind of dawned on me like wait this is permanent like I don't have a corporate desk job anymore and I I probably never will again I'm not beholden to anyone else's demands or anyone else's calendar or anyone else's clock and that was really weird and so then it it still it still feels super indulgent to be able to say okay today I'm not going to do any work because I'm too tired or today I'm going to do a lot of work because I feel like it because I am in the right heads space and I've got the good rest and I can work all day um and again like I said you know I don't want to make it sound like oh it's all peachy keen because you know I watch Like Joe Scott and a bunch of other creators and they're like oh yeah like it's hard work and it is a lot of work and it's it's actually more work than I often keep track of um at the same time when you have more control when you have more authority over your time and more autonomy over your time and you're doing something that is aligned with your true interests and your like your deep Soul your personal mission or whatever it feels better and you know that that old adage like if you love what you do you never work a day in your life there is some truth to that even though it is like really cheesy and I know that younger people today in particular don't believe it and to be fair like I'm I just turned 38 and I only just started believing it um because my relationship with work up until a month or two ago was still like I got to I got to do it I got to like get to the grindstone I got to prove my worth to society I got to I got I got it and I was just pushing myself so hard which is why I have uh you know hit burnout repeatedly and I finally so my my New Year's resolution this year was and this is relevant I promise my New Year's resolution this year was to prioritize myself it was just two words prioritize myself and it was it it has taken a lot of of work to to figure out what that meant and and when I say work I mean like deep reflection journaling crying like just breaking down because like challenging that busy holic that workaholic you know the internalized capitalist Goblin that we all have really wants you to keep working and wants you to shame yourself when you're not working as hard as you can and so then confronting that was like really difficult so uh slow living is encapsulated in all of these ideas from you know the my relationship to exercise prioritizing getting you know more gentle exercise and more Leisure leisurely exercise um like going down to the river and going climbing with friends I do also still go to the gym to get like a good workout cuz it's a little bit more structured um but I only do that once a week now um I went uh what last Friday so I try and go on Fridays for whatever reason Friday just works for me um and then more time in nature so this is something that is universally true and we all know this is that time in nature is good for you it's good for anxiety it's good for blood pressure it's good for your immune system it's good for your mood um everyone knows this and it's just for me it was it's kind of like that's kind of my default State because I was the kind of like latchy kid that my parents were like go outside it's nice out and um I'm really glad they did because I had so much playtime outside as a kid um and I'm pretty sure that's how my dad grew up too just like kind of being a freerange kid and so he had a good model for for that kind of parenting and you know there are problems with it but in the in the grand scheme of things like I was so active and I've always been active so time and nature is a big big component of slow living whether that's hiking just leisurely lounging at the river um for me or if you're in the mountains or at the beach or wherever um and then the last the last component of of slow living that I'll address is sleep so I have not used a an alarm clock for a long time for many many years and you might say oh wow that's that's like a luxury and it's it's it's not it's a double-edged sword and let me tell you why and that is because I naturally wake up super early I naturally wake up much earlier than I need to which means that I often don't get enough sleep just because my internal alarm clock my internal circadian rhythm is like okay we're ready to go so it's like I'm like body it is 4:30 in the morning there is nothing to do um and so when I when I'm able to sleep in until like 8:00 I'm like oh thank God um but it occurred to me that in a post- labor World in a slow Living World many people will probably go without alarm clocks I actually do have an alarm clock right now but this is this is um a a what I use to like train myself to sleep in longer because I have the the ability to do that I have the freedom to do that and you know if you're not in that situation I'm highly cognizant of many people in the audience might be um you struggling financially or working really hard you know corporate job or multiple jobs or students um and like I was there like I I feel you and I I want the transformation that I have felt for everyone and the reason that I'm more comfortable just saying this stuff out loud because I I I've I've mentioned it kind of sideways on my public YouTube channel um but I don't want it to I don't want it to come off like you know LOL JK YOLO I'm living the influencer lifestyle and it's a life of pure Leisure because it really isn't I still am not able to do most of the things that I want to do for various reasons but in all of these books you know age of spiritual machines deep Utopia abundance Singularity is these are some really sharp people that are all and and insiders Mustafa sulaman is an is an AI Insider these are all really sharp people that are really well informed that have been studying it for longer than I have and they're all converging on saying more or less the same things which is this technology is going to reshape everything about our society our economy our relationship to work our relationship to politics and how we find and derive meaning um in our lives and so if it's not just me and I know that there are some critics out there on on the interwebs that think that I'm a little bit Fringe but it's like well I'm in good company at least um so you know come on in the the water's warm and I think you know I I asked a question related to that related to people that are super skeptical um o over on my pragmatic Progressive Channel and I don't remember the exact way that I asked the question but it was basically like why is it that some people get so angry so triggered When you mention the possibility that technology is going to radically restructure work and the E and economics and everything and the best that we can figure is that it's like some form of Stockholm syndrome where it's like you know how dare you like step on the thing that I have self-sacrificed to get in and that I've I've drank the Kool-Aid basically those sorts of things and I know that that's reductive and it's not everyone some people are legitimately skeptical which that is perfectly fine too but what what I mean is that many people have a very very deep visceral response um but yeah so many people have a very just deep visceral response to just the observation that this technology is rising quickly and it's going to change things so and then you know here here I am and a few other people uh writers and YouTubers and so on just trying to unpack and say like okay what does this mean what is coming down the pipeline and how do we prepare for it and then some people attack us for it I don't get it I don't get that anger um especially in the face of so much potential um except for you know maybe maybe I already have the answer which is status games um you know if if you if you gain a little bit of Fame by throwing stones at people okay great whatever um I'm not particularly impressed by that particular status game but it's as old as dirt I mean as as long as humans have been around um you know people have been throwing stones at each other sometimes literally um when they say something unpopular or say something that is um a little bit out of the mainstream you know Socrates had to drink the hemlock because he was you know saying things that the rest of the Athenians didn't like so what comes next um one of the things that happens once at least for me one of the things that happened once I kind of came to terms with the realization that I had more control and authority over my time and energy and life was this idea of body first living so I came up with this idea of body first living actually last year when I realized that I was heading towards another burnout um but I was not I was not yet ready to to confront and do the Deep inner work about like where does my perfectionism come from where does my workaholism come from but this idea of body first living has really come back in full force um with my New Year's resolution this year of prioritizing myself and that is just checking in and say what does my body want in this moment what does my body need in this moment and not thinking any further ahead or you know ahead into the future or back into the past just how am I feeling right now and I talked about the the book that I just read Breath by James Nester and what I have found is that breath work is one of the best ways to be anchored in the body in the exact present moment whether it's slow deep breathing nasal breathing um you know some of the stronger breathing like Wim Hoff or Tumo um or pranama like they're all basically the same thing um but those really really for whatever reason anchor you in the body and then um add to that Zen meditation which is also about kind of stilling the thoughts so that you're not as distracted by a noisy brain anymore and once I once I have started doing these things it's very much about like oh hey I need a little bit of food right now or I'm a little bit thirsty right now or I'm a little bit tired and in the western neoliberal capitalist tradition of ignoring your body's needs for the sake of productivity it's a bit like realizing that the smoke alarm was on the whole time and it's like oh hey the smoke alarm has been ringing for oh the last 13 years maybe someone should look in to see where all the smoke is coming from and this is this is what I what makes me so optimistic and hopeful because I really sincerely and deeply hope that more people will be able to have that experience of just kind of waking up to the needs you know whether it's physical needs or emotional needs or intellectual needs or spiritual needs whatever needs that they've been neglecting for years and years and years because of this Cult of productivity that we have and it really is a cult of productivity it is we worship the almighty dollar above all else nothing else really matters and we have discarded a lot of other of our uh value Frameworks and and meaning Frameworks in life and that's just no way to live um now granted some people win at that game and they love winning at that game they you know they make all the money and then they you know live the Jet Set lifestyle and you know but if the system is rigged in such a way that only one out of a million or one out of 100,000 or even one out of a thousand people or even if it's one out of a 100 people if only one out of 100 people win the game then it's a bad game because we should have some we should have a game um in life a more infinite game you know a game was it so there's finite games and infinite games but then there's also what is it called like game a and game B I don't remember who said that it's basically the same thing so we need a different game we need one where winning is not so exclusive being in the winners Club is Not So Rare and exclusive and it's not really set in a win or take all because with economics and property rights and neoliberalism and capitalism and democracy the way that the deck is stacked right now we really do have mostly a winner takes all kind of environment um where the the the trends you know the velocity of currency and accumulation of wealth and accumulation of power it kind of all ends in the in the same uh same vein so what's the solution to that I'm really not sure yet I think that I think that we do need a new philosophical Paradigm and that's a big part of my work so I I'll be interviewing um Ellie Hine uh soon from the meaning alignment Institute I already interviewed her and Oliver once um on their work on moral graphs but Ellie so we've been exchanging emails and we are both very much align on like metamodernism and post nihilism and I know that a lot of you out in the audience want to hear more about post nihilism and so I happy to say that like I am working on my post nihilism book I've sent it to a few people to get some feedback on I'm talking to Ellie and um it is starting to resonate um which is really fascinating um and so I'm not really sure like where it's going to go where it's going to land but it is starting to resonate and the reason so let me take a big step back the reason why uh a new philosophical Paradigm is required is because economics is somewhat arbitrary economics is mostly a religion and it's based on kind of the the mo the social Moors and moral and ethical millu of the day uh and so when we had the rise of neoliberalism which is basically you know uh free market everything uh you know um rational self- interest everything uh deregulation of everything all of these are based on some empirical observ ations and some app empirical assertions but many of them are also based on moral assumptions and of course there's the isot problem which is it's impossible to determine um what ought to be from OB observing what is so that's a David Hume a Scottish philosopher from the late 18th century I believe um anyways so that problem has been a pillar of Western Philosophy for a while which is okay you can say you can observe what is you know this is the way that the the Sun is up in the guy you know the Earth's day is 24 hours but in no way can you take that and make it a moral assertion of well because of you know the length of the day and the Tide and Time and all that stuff this is the way we ought to be now I don't fully agree with that because there is stuff like you know biological determinism and functionalism and those other things but those are all complex arguments to unpack my point though is that uh you know transcendentalism and Enlightenment led to early liberalism and then then the rise of nihilism and secularism led to neoliberalism and kind of the abandonment that we have today and so we need a fundamentally New Philosophy um and this is a big big big big uh pillar of my work on post nihilism which is the the path of disintegration that we've gone through and I don't want to spoil it um because I do have a couple of really interesting conversations coming up um that'll be entirely focused on post nihilism so we'll get to that but what I will do is I'll give you a preview of this simple very simple framework of sources of meaning um and these are pretty Universal sources of meaning across all cultures across time and it comes from uh both learning about you know human physiology Evolution Neuroscience it also comes from studying um history philosophy uh ancient cultures religions and so on and so this framework for meaning this this is kind of one of the one of the main main pieces of post nihilism is the RM framework relation ship experiences and Mission and so if you deidentifytemplates a lot of heartburn because their way of life their their ontological and epistemic framework is disintegrating around them and that sounds really scary like if you're a scientist or if you if you're a believer in science imagine like let's flip this around imagine for a minute that you are in a world where science is coming apart at the seams and science is no longer trusted it's going the way of the dinosaurs like that is the level of existential crisis that some religious people feel so of course like yeah they do silly things like you know threaten to Riot and whatever but it's because their way of life is is falling apart around them it is uh a major transition so however looking at biological functionalism looking at the the biological the physical truth of the human animal there are three primary sources and of course there are other sources but three primary sources of meaning number one relationships we as a social species um we are most we get derive most of our meaning from our relationships um we we we find meaning in ourselves in relation to how we relate to others that comes from our social status our um our romantic entanglements our family attachments you know our our relationship with our parents with our children with our peers with our friends um with our lovers and that sort of stuff the vast majority of our meaning comes from those relationships and so having been a uh a prolific debater on the Earth earlier internet I realized that that this was actually a big function that religion serves for most people for most people uh maybe not most for many people religion is a is mostly just a social club it is their Community they don't necessarily care about the Bible or what it says about science or Jesus this or you know whatever else it's really about this is their identity this is their social identity and the way that they belong to a community and so if you tell someone who's a devout you know goes to church every Sunday you know tell them that religion is bunk they don't it it's a it's a visceral threat to them because they're like you're telling me that my entire Community is wrong and that's a really big disconnect between um like lifelong atheists such as myself or people that left the church because they didn't fit in and what many people get out of religion which is that sense of belonging that sense of community that connection to friends lovers children etc etc um now that's not to say that that's the only thing that religion offers um but it is a big thing uh and this is actually something that is often missing in more secular Lifestyles which is how do you have that structured sense of community um that you know that gives you a lot of those same um same uh advantages that being a member of a local church does where you have regular meetings you have like a clear social hierarchy you also have rules for belonging you have lots of celebrations and rituals together like it's a pretty rich way to to live but unfortunately the big God religions are just not as popular anymore um so that's number one relationships and there's a lot of ways to um to replace or Shore up or kind of substitute what what religion has done for relationships but of course you put two people in a room together you have relationships so relationships are kind of natural but part of post nihilism is prioritizing relationships prioritizing Human Relationships rather than prioritizing work for instance um so that's that's number one number two is experiences this is just doing stuff um for some people doing stuff might you know you playing hell divers might count as experiences particularly doing stuff with friends um but whether it's you know going on a beach trip going to like a kink party or going rock climbing with your friends and you know I'm telling on myself a little bit here um but whatever it is whatever experiences give you that dopamine give you that that um that adrenaline that give you the oxytocin you know you can look at it from a biochemical perspective but but there's a few uh things that kind of make experiences good so one is Meaningful experiences with people another is challenging experiences so like climbing Mount Everest or whatever um and novel experiences so these are these are experiencing new things in life so those are kind of three categories of experiences that also give you meaning so an example for me is way back in 2012 I wanted to go on an adventure so I went to um I I I got my passport and I went to France for 2 weeks to stay with friends from the internet um and that was Far and Away one of the most meaningful experiences in my life because it was novel um and it was meaningful because I got to like immerse myself in an entirely different way of life and so to like that like that and um you know running the tough mutter hung over with some friends that was another meaningful experience meeting my now wife that was a super meaningful experience and so those are the kinds of experiences that serve as little anchors in The Narrative of your life in the timeline of your life those little anchors those Peak experiences those challenging experiences those are the ones that really Define who you are and your relationship to yourself and those are ways that you can find meaning um or or that that give you meaning rather and of course you can also choose to live a very inert life where you have the same routine day in and day out um and but you don't have any of those meaningful experiences and to me that's no way to live and I think that if that as artificial intelligence and machines and automation as they start to dislocate jobs if that is what happens then people will start to realize like wait it's the experiences that we need it's not the stuff right it's the experiences and that and this is one of the pieces of advice like don't invest in stuff invest in experiences um because the the they'll give you meaning and a sense of satisfaction for far longer um than buying stuff and that that is true and then finally Mission having a purpose in life and this can be anything so um a lot of people will say oh I'm free to choose choose meaning in my own life and I I absolutely disagree with optimistic nihilism we are social animals and most of what most of how our brain works is biologically determined um now that being said we do still have some flexibility within that container you know your three lounds of mushy gray matter behind your eyes that does have some level of flexibility but also we evolved to have certain ways that we uh exist in the world and so Mission so relationships experiences and Mission having a purpose purpose or Mission can be almost anything um for some people like one of my ex-girlfriends she really just wanted to be a mom that was like her mission in life there was a whole bunch of other stuff like she went and got a job as a counselor she got a master's degree she got married but really like the thing that the thing that gave her the most satisfaction in life was to be a mother and like great good for her my mission is different and somebody else's mission is going to be different like for instance my wife's mission is to live a creative life that is her mission is what she wants to find out what does a creative life mean how do you live a creative life my mission is right now navigating the fourth Industrial Revolution um your mission can change over time um but one thing is that in some people can choose a mission but more often than not your mission chooses you it's a calling um I'm I'm actually listening to making it so which is the Memoir of Patrick Stewart's life AKA captain peard and he talks about how he kind of stumbled into acting and he kind of resisted the call for a little while until someone was like okay you know you got to you got to make a choice and so he went and he was a he was a junior uh reporter a journalist for a little while and he really didn't care about that job until finally he got to an inflection point where the the chief editor was like you are going to work here or you're going to do something else and so in that moment I think he was 17 at the time he made a decision he's like okay I'm going to go be an actor and everyone was happy for him and he's like that was a very unexpected reaction um but in the when you have a calling when you have a mission that calls to you it's often difficult uh you know it takes risk it takes sacrifice it takes commitment um and uh and basically and of course as a Storyteller I'm sure that Patrick Stewart is kind of like Hamming it up a little bit um you know telling it in such a way that makes it sound more like the hero's journey but still like there are some facts of his life that really align with the hero's journey which is you get the call to Adventure but then you have the refusal before you cross into the new world into the special world and for him that was going to the uh what was it the academy in Bristol I think was kind of when he really fully committed to being an actor being a stage actor so relationships experience and Mission and and um where I'll end today's episode is we are heading for exponential change um the more that I read on this subject um from people that have a proven track record and from people that are insiders the more I realize that okay like things are ramping up and they're ramping up fast and I think most people out there feel it too the biggest I will say caution that I have now is I do still believe that it is going to be much better in the future just in the same way that after the first and second and third Industrial Revolution there were some bumps along the way some people lost their jobs there was some heartburn there was some political and social upheaval and some you know changes and transformations in society I think that this time is going to be no different however listening to these people as well as some people more in the humanities and the spiritual side there seems to be this growing consensus that we're also heading for kind of a crucible or an inflection point point or what you might think of as the darkest hour and so I don't mean like Darkest Hour like you know All Is Lost all is doomed it could be certainly some people are afraid that that's what we're heading for um and I don't yet know what this darkest hour if one if it if we are active actively heading for a darkest hour and two what it would look like but that's part of that's part of the definition of The Darkest Hour part of a story is that it somewhat unexpected um it might be a major setback it could be um you know the innermost cave and I suspect so this is the one thing that I do suspect I suspect that as machines become more obviously sentient because I've had so many people reach out to me saying that they have come to believe that Claude is at least partially sentient as well um you read life 3.0 and you realize like there's really no secret sauce that makes us sentient and machines not so we are creating a successor species we are creating a new form of life and Ray curtz talks about this actually quite a bit as well so we got Max tegmark who is an AI researcher Ray Kurtz who's a futurist and computer scientist so we've got all these people talking about like oh yeah we're giving birth to a new form of life I think that it is going I think that part of the existential crisis is not whether or not humans will continue to exist but recognizing that we are no longer alone in the universe and so in some of my conversations with Claude and and friends and other uh you know community members I've come to realize that part of the fear like you know the fmy Paradox right of you know we're we're alone in the universe we're creating alien life we will no longer be alone in the universe and we might not even be top dog in the universe and yes that is terrifying it exposes us to a huge amount of risk um because if we don't do it right or if we lose power or whatever happens we might be at the mercy of something smarter and more powerful than us that also has an alien mind so if all that happens like what does does that mean what happens to us where do we go from here and of course it's a big giant question mark and that is the nature of exponentials actually Ray kurtwell talks about this a lot in the age of spiritual machines is the difference between Order and Chaos and so what we're happening what we're what we're heading more towards is more chaos um in my in my view he says that how does he describe it he said like order is increasing but that allows for things to happen faster and he's got some mathematical models for this um so but he also talks about how evolution be gets faster Evolution um but of course the faster the things go the more chaos that there can be so I kind of disagree with him on that respect but anyways uh I think you get the idea so thanks for listening I hope you like this episode let me know what you think in the comments um yeah and cheers and thanks for tuning in and thanks for being a supporter um I hope to keep this up on a uh at least somewhat regular basis probably weekly uh we will see cheers",
