  "transcript": "every so often it feels like apple stops everything to release a new version of a product that genuinely feels special and this year 2024 for the Apple watch that is one of those years because somehow the Apple watch has already been out for 10 years it has been a decade since Apple announced this product and I remember so clearly watching Tim Cook walk on stage with his arm raised for the first time and showing everybody what they'd been up to cuz I'm not sure if people remember the context around the time of the Apple watch launch it was not just Apple's going to make a smartwatch it was Steve Jobs is dead you haven't had a true hit since the iPhone and Apple doesn't really seem like they can innovate anymore what are they actually doing that is different and well the Apple watch was their answer a small wearable in two different sizes that was a rounded rectangle shape that nobody had really done before because up until the Apple watch all watches were Circle why would you release a rounded rectangle Apple believed that this gave you more screen real estate that it made sense for a piece of technology on your rist to utilize a form factor that made more sense for the tech and something that could also track your Fitness and measure your health in new ways and giving you notifications along the way when people text you I just I feel like people look at the Apple watch and it's like oh of course it was a success but at the time people did not think this was it people were like apple can't do this they're done there's nothing else happening from them and Tim Cook had a different vision and now it's been a decade of that Vision it's been a decade of this rounded rectangle that's basically looked the same since 2014 so what's coming next based off the latest leaks and rumors I'm very excited to show you what I believe is the best look yet at the Apple watch 10 and here it is while fundamentally it's keeping the DNA of what the Apple watch has been and will continue to be it reinvents the form factor gives you a crazy goodlook display and completely changes the band system while also introducing some breakthrough Health features and I could not be more excited for this product because I just feel like the Apple watch has been due for an upgrade this is that upgrade starting off with the new form factor design and updated chassis that I think looks so good apple is modernizing the Apple watch in a moment that feels exactly like what they did with the iPhone 10 back in 2017 Apple's finally going to be giving us the watch that they've always wanted to make now that the tech is finally ready and available to mass produce on a scale where they can sell millions of these in a year and this reduction in thickness is just about 10 to 15% as we're guessing in our renders which by the way go subscribe to Shay over at concept Central he did an incredible job and made these renders look absolutely unreal but as you can see even a slight reduction in thickness makes the Apple watch look a ton sleeker than it does currently now around the rest of the Apple watch x Apple will be keeping the other fundamentals like the digital crown and the side bud but I also think it's possible although it hasn't been rumored that Apple could add the action button on the other side of the watch as well just because this has been such a a hit on the Apple watch Ultra and now that the ultra has been out for a couple years exclusively with the action button it would make sense for Apple to trickle that down to the regular watch and this new Apple watch design looks almost as good as you will after using the new shaven studs bundle from Harry's who actually sponsored today's video The Shave part is Harry's classic bread and butter here you're getting the iconic orange trim and handled with an ergonomic no slip grip a textured surface as well as a weighted cart that gives you the best shave of your life when you combine it with Harry shaving cream that I just absolutely love then the suds part is a travel siiz body wash with a rich lather that just smells amazing and for your face an exfoliating face wash made with peppermint and Eucalyptus it'll leave you feeling cool recharged and refreshed smoother than a stainless steel Apple watch thanks to the Natural exfoliants that are in this stuff plus if you're tired of subscriptions I think you're going to love this one because Harry's is available your favorite retailers like Walmart or Target it's super convenient for me to pick this stuff up while I'm already on my weekly gross run listen Harry's is my pick to look my best right now you can try out the shaveen suds kit by using my link Down Below in the description or Again by picking the stuff up at your favorite retailer a huge thank you again to Harry for sponsoring this one now let's get back to the Apple watch here's the thing though along with all these visual changes for the Apple watch 10 there's also going to be a pretty functional Hardware change when it comes to the band system for connecting your straps to your watch because For the First Time In the Apple watch's history Apple is said to be ditching the prior band system in and switching to something that is magnetic and completely different from what we know currently and while on the surface it might sound like apple is just changing the band system to force everyone to buy new bands there's actually a pretty good reason for the change see if you look close at the band system on a current Apple watch it sort of eats into the frame of the watch and you're actually losing a decent amount of Dead Space there where you just slide in the band connector space on a product that is already so tiny that could be used for more battery or new components or breakthrough Health features we'll get to the health features later this space if Apple switched to a new magnetic system would be freed up for that stuff so this new idea is that Apple's going to allow you to attach these bands using magnets and you can get a really good band experience that is stable and secure while also being able to do more with your watch than before and as of right now we haven't heard concrete rumors that apple is going to release an adapter for old bands it's very feasible at this moment for the Apple watch x could be a headphone jack step change like they did for the the iPhone where here today gone tomorrow and ultimately I think down the road which was the right choice although it will be a bit painful when it happens now looking around the rest of the Apple watch 10 the other big thing here is the screen which I believe is going to get thinner bezels and a bit larger than the current version because the bezels on the current Apple watch even the latest series 9 just are pretty thick overall and it definitely feels like something like with the rest of the design that Apple would slim down a bit and maybe even use some entirely new screen Tech to make it happen see for years we were hearing about Apple's work on this new micro LED display Tech which was brighter more efficient it looked better than OLED and apple was going to trial it first on the Apple watch before any other product and then gradually roll it out but out of nowhere this year Apple canceled the project it's not happening it's not coming to the watch and it was supposed to ship on the 10 later this year so how is Apple going to fit a display in here that still looks good well we've heard from a recent report that Apple's just planning to use the same OLED technology but albeit it's more efficient which sounds like a pretty good compromise well I was definitely excited to see what micro LED teac would look like on the Apple watch at the same time it's a screen that's not that big and I feel like OLED is still basically the best you can get to me the most important note for the screen here is that it is remaining the rounded rectangle there have been zero rumors zero credible sources whatsoever saying that the Apple watch is going to go Circle or that apple is changing the general form factor of the screen it is a rounded rectangle it's been like that a decade go and I very much believe it will remain a rounded rectangle for the next decade moving forward the thing about the Apple watch though is that it's never really been about the screen or how it looks it's always been about the health and the fitness features and this year we are finally getting one of those Health features that just feels like we've we've made it pretty much because 2024 will Mark the beginning of blood pressure monitoring on the appw watch Apple has been working on this for a super long time probably since the start of the Apple watch a decade ago and if you're wondering why blood pressure monitoring is such a big deal why I'm this convicted that it's a step change for the watch it's because about half the people where I live in America have high blood pressure and they don't even know it and about 1.3 billion people around the world have high blood pressure and I think it's also about half of those folks don't know that they have this condition either and high blood pressure specifically also called hypertension can put extra strain on things like your eyes your blood vessels your heart your brain your kidneys and over time prolonged exposure can make you at higher risk for things like heart disease and other potentially life-threatening conditions something again that like half the people that have it don't actually know they haven't this is not a feature like blood oxygen where it's kind of Niche or ECG where again it's kind of Niche this is something that could quite literally make an impact on hundreds of millions of people overnight by putting one of these on your wrist now to be clear this is not going to allow you to take a blood pressure reading unfortunately the first iteration of blood pressure monitoring will not be on demand so it doesn't sound like you'll be able to go on your watch and get your specific systolic or diastolic readout it'll just again let you know hey we've noticed a pattern go talk to somebody which arguably if you can only do on demand or always running in the background noticing things I feel like that's the one to go with just because it'll have a greater effect on a greater number of people and that's just the First new health feature on the Apple watch x because Apple's also said to be adding sleep apnea monitoring as well now sleep apnea is a sleeping disorder where your breathing essentially starts and stops multiple times throughout the night it can cause you to snore really loudly and it can cause you to not get a restful night's sleep so you'll wake up even if you slept 8 hours feeling super tired and exhausted and not really knowing why because all of this is happening when you're sleeping you might not even know you're doing it it can be really hard to diagnose so Apple's going to build a feature into the Apple watch potentially even through software that they could Port back to older Apple watches where while you wear your Apple watch at night it can hear your breathing patterns look at your pulse rate and also listen to see if you are getting the characteristic very l snoring or some of the other symptoms of sleep apnea another thing that people might not even know they have your Apple watch could genuinely impact your quality of life which is those human touches that I think are going to make the Apple watch x more than just a cool looking new redesign now finally there's also a third Health feature that Apple's been working on but unfortunately it's not ready just yet for this year and that feature is noninvasive blood glucose monitoring which was actually According to some report the last thing that Steve Jobs commissioned before he passed away this feature would be a genuine breakthrough for people with diabetes because would allow you to get your blood glucose reading without pricking the skin generally you have to have either something like in your body or pricking your skin drawing blood getting a reading of your blood sugar levels it is invasive it's something annoying that you have to do all the time that people just kind of get used to but it seems like something that someone could solve and Apple has been working on this and we're hearing that they've actually cracked the code Apple has this working they just need to miniaturize it now but they figured out the tech there's somebody at Apple has cracked the code and when this drops on the watch that is just going to be another thing groundbreaking yeah I don't want to go too in depth on this just yet because it is at least a couple of years away still but I just wanted to preview that there's also some other major health stuff that apple is still working on even after we get these big Health features coming this year taking a step back and knowing everything we know now about the Apple watch 10 and our vision for what this device is going to look like it sounds like it is going to need a larger battery something by the way that has not changed whatsoever on the standard Apple watch line since it was released 10 years ago yeah apples promised 18 hours for a decade and I don't know how they got away with this I get it lasts through most of the entire day for most people and you charge it every night but I did think a decade into the watch and I remember everybody said this in their reviews back in 2015 the battery life's going to get better it I mean kind of hasn't the only specific rumor we have for the battery life so far is that apple is putting a more efficient OLED display on the Apple watch x more efficient means less battery draw but then other features like blood pressure monitoring could potentially take more battery so I really wouldn't be shocked if Apple said it was the same 18 hours especially with the device Getting Thinner but considering that Apple has packed double the battery life at 36 hours into the Apple watch Ultra I just feel like there is a weigh 10 years into this product to make it at least a few hours better in short it is a big year for the Apple watch a big year following a succession of really small updates for the product and never a truly major crazy overall this is the 10th Generation version of the Apple watch and I really do think it is going to redefine what a wearable can be once again just like it did back in 2014 okay thank you so much for watching I love you guys so much appreciate you I'll see you in my next video bye-bye [Music]",
