nvidia's vice president of healthcare and Life Sciences Kimberly pal thank you good morning healthc care is good to put at 8 A.M because we're all early risers I expect uh thank you for many of you traveling a couple hours uh to come to this uh session at 8 a.m. uh this is an absolutely extraordinary time accelerated Computing has allowed us to help so many great Partners you just saw in that video and others around the world um create some of the most advanced Medical and Life Sciences instruments over the last decade things like our our first interactions with Seamans and the 4D Ultrasound way back when in 2008 for the last decade working on incredible genomic sequencing platforms from Next Generation sequencing long read sequencing single cell now into spatial genomics creating an incredible digital biology Revolution we're also working in helping uh these amazing new microscopes that are capturing biology at incredible you know submicron uh resolutions into uh the Next Generation CTS Photon counting CT able to now capture the function of anatomy it's really really quite breathtaking and then you saw Moon surgical a new generation of surgical robots is now being made possible because we've made accelerated Computing and now generative AI completely accessible accelerated Computing is what allowed generative AI to be invented and now we have these two platforms coming together to make Healthcare become one of the largest technology Industries in the world if not it will be the largest it's been an incredible journey and we're just getting started if you can imagine in the future billions of surgeries and imaging studies around the world will all have medical assistance working on their behalf from The Ordering of the image study or the preparing of the surgery all the way through to the writing of those reports the amazing um $250 billion dollar of R&D that is spent every year in the quest to find life-saving medicines is going to be completely redesigned I see some friends in the audience who are at the Forefront of this redesign because digital biology and now generative AI are going to allow us to redesign this process redesign this 250 billion that's spent every single year and then digital Health we're at the uh opportunity now to think of digital Health in a completely new way just as all of you I'm sure play with chat GPT every single day or use it as a a very regular tool we're going to have as consumers many co-pilots working on our behalf the future of Physicians and in fact the future of patients is also having many co-pilots working on their behalf all of these Healthcare interactions can be connected now to supercomputers that can be running these generative Healthcare agents it's just an absolutely extraordinary time and I would love to share a lot of the work that we're doing with our ecosystem uh to bring this to life you know that we launched Nvidia Clara just about six months after the Transformer was invented we realized that AI is going to be domain specific and so we invented the platform inidia Clara after Clara Barton not Santa Clara uh she was the inventor of the American Red Cross and it's a platform to help people Clara is a platform to help the whole industry take advantage AG of the most advanced Computing applications in the world computer Graphics accelerated Computing and then and now of course uh generative AI we work across the most important domains of health care of course we started our time uh with working in Partners who were innovating on sensor technologies that allows us to see inside the human body right and uh then moving into uh the Imaging and processing of that Imaging so we could add uh I'll use I'll use Eric topel's terms a a digital pair of eyes to all of these Radiology exams um but now we're moving into um very very important domains as I said through the genomic Revolution a digital biology Revolution is here and there's so much information in this data that we still don't even know about yet uh in pionering now into language models and multimodal using video and language models in combination to do some prettyy amazing things we're going to be announcing or Jensen even announced uh yesterday a new layer to the Nvidia Computing stack as you know for a while we've been building chips and systems we build the system software we've been building the application acceleration libraries even into application Frameworks that you know about Clara we have hollow skin parabricks monai we have bioo we're adding a new layer where we're taking these amazing capabilities and we're turning them into microservices this is an incredibly important uh packaging of software that is going to enable the industry to adopt these Technologies not in a matter of months but literally in a matter of minutes you can think about these microservices as a packaging of the software so we curate our own software we curate the amazing software that's happening around the world in the open source we curate software that is being developed by amazing Partners we package it up into a container it contains all of the software stack necessary the Cuda version the inference engines and it packages it all up into one container so it's optimized and it has a defined set of standard apis and it's essentially put into a too box imagine all of this amazing technology we've built we've now packaged it up so you can take it to go that means you can run it on the entirety of the install base I'm going to bring this concept to life because I think this is what's going to accelerate this industry to not in 20 years be the world's largest technology industry but maybe in five I talked a bit about the digital biology Revolution it's really quite stunning and we're right in the middle of this huge hockey stick curve of what's Happening you know we we've been working in genomics for a long time and across DNA RNA sequencing and then single cell sequencing has just made really really profound uh breakthroughs to be able to look at the heterogeneity of cells so that we can understand you know when you have uh something a tumor in your body what cells are causing the behavior and that is that was an incredible breakthrough and it's driving a lot of great Target Discovery and and initiatives in the drug Discovery Space and we're embarking now with some incredible Partners in pushing into what is spatial biology not only does It capture the uh heterogeneity of the cells but it also can capture spatially where are they located so you can understand the interactions of these cells in a complete tissue this is the kind of resolution this multiscale resolution and even the transcriptomes I should also add across that entire tissue this understanding of biology is going to hallucinate things we've not been able to understand in the past and this is really really really what's uh turbocharging some incredible work um in the digital biology area we're announcing uh today or yesterday I guess the official announcements went out um that we're going to be building a whole bunch of microservices uh for genomics we've been building uh parabricks for the last several years and we're going to be building more and more uh microservices to not only apply it to the genomics analysis pipeline so all of these incredible platforms can actually be read the data can be read but then we want to be building microservices in Earnest so that they can be understood you know there's one thing to read something there's another thing to understand it and we still have a ways to go to understand everything we can about genomics so we packaged up uh for example the the uh germline pipeline this used to be a very monolithic application you would take the whole thing and you would go and you would deploy it somewhere we've Excel at it immensely over the years but we've turned them into two distinct microservices and so now literally with two microservices one for alignment and one for uh variant calling we've leveraged uh and worked with deep variant uh with the Google team and we've created actually a universal deep variant collar uh that is completely compatible with alumina pack bios singular Ultima Oxford nanopore so you literally have one microservice that has the most accurate variant calling across all the platforms we've turned it into to as simple as an API call and so what what is the opportunity here to recognize I'm trying to put this into an application many of these sequencing platform companies they're really trying to get the platform to Market it's very hard these sensors and they literally have robots inside the machine so that they can get the throughput that they need the chemistry it's incredibly complex and so we're trying to assist in this analysis now they can take this alignment microservice and literally deploy it on the instrument if they wish they can deploy it on a a workstation sitting next to it on a data center sitting in the facility or on the cloud completely up to you and then similarly you can do your variant calling on the instrument data center or cloud and we've completely packaged up the software so you can experience this and what's amazing about it is you automatically get all of the incredible optimization work that Nvidia is waking up every day doing on your behalf and so here here you can see um it you can optimize for time in the case of critical care patients you might want to get to those variant calls in minutes you might want to optimize for price because you're doing very large scale population programs you have now that choice because all these microservices can be deployed on the gpus for the cost and Time Performance that you are looking for but it as simple as deploying this on a djx uh Cloud node you can literally get this working done in just 10 minutes so that is the power of these microservices and then as I said we're taking it further we're taking our genomics analysis work into this next tertiary domain and really trying to extract the insights we're working with the ecosystem when you're in spatial genomics Land one of the most important steps in analysis there is to actually do C cell segmentation there's millions of cells that are being captured knowing what those cells are and having a foundation found model which we are building called Vista 2D a foundation model that can generalize across cell types and cell strains is really really a powerful now again microservice that we're going to be making available to the genomics industry we have just incredible Partnerships and this ecosystem is continuing to expand in really powerful ways I've talked about um gpus being facilitating the actual building of these platforms they would not be able to get to Market without the accelerated Computing full stop um many of them have turned to deep learning to do the initial base calling step but we're not stopping there these microservices are giving the capability to make this acceleration available in all of the cloud platforms all of the genomics isvs that exist in the world all the service providers so that you can experience this as users of those platforms and then of course we're helping the pioneering work of translational medicine and the these large research programs around the world we're in the next phase some incredible research has been done in just the last six months where we're taking this amazing data that's coming out of these platforms and we're applying um generative AI in really really profound ways in fact uh the team at uh the vector Institute and University of Toronto they created one of the first single cell GPT models and they showed that just like in text has a relationship to the words that genes have a relationship to cells and that these type of models can generalize very well to a lot of powerful Downstream tasks the team at Deep genomics took that even further uh they uh invented big RNA and announced that uh late last year and big RNA is allowing them to really understand a lot more about disease mechanisms they actually using it to uh discover new therapeutic candidates um and do a lot of work in RNA expression um and then just last month uh was we were invited up to the The Arc uh Arc Institute and they announced their Evo model this Evo model took it even a step further using the ability to do long context biological Foundation model um that can uh essentially generalize across all the biology domains DNA RNA and proteins and it's really incredibly capable of both um prediction tasks as well as um generation from molecule all the way up to whole genome so we are just getting started here and these are some incredible breakthroughs and so we want to facilitate this ability to do that um and and it's just a representation here that we for the first time are at this point where we can digitize biology at new resolutions new uh volumes new sizes new new complexities we have the GPT moment essentially we have this ability to train up very very large language models and we have the AI supercomputer so we literally have the three ingredients that we are going to start to experience that exponential progress and capabilities just like we have in natural language processing Across the Life Sciences and Drug Discovery domain because for the first time we can represent essentially the world of drugs in the computer and the minute you can represent something in a computer you can start building really really powerful models once you can build really really powerful models you can start simulating how they behave together so this is this really really extraordinary time um that we're living in right now we uh invented Nvidia biion Nemo to facilitate and accelerate this uh research there is burgeoning research going on in Foundation models across all of these domains and so we built uh not only a framework but also a bunch of microservices that I'm going to talk about our nid biion Nemo framework is expanding quite quickly in terms of its functionality we're listening to all of our collaborators and users and again we've built in um features this is a domain specific framework that speaks the languages of chemistry proteins and DNA in fact some of the new features that we're announcing are that are the support of DNA language models it has the ability to do some really interesting geometric deep learning models so this is where we're doing a lot of sophisticated work and diffusion so we can understand the interactions of proteins and lians um these Foundation models are just incredible we're being surprised by their capabilities just like I'm surprised by gpt's capabilities every single day and so this framework is is continuing to expand we are also on a plan to open source it or is it open source today might be anyway it's going to be open source so the the hope is that everybody who's working on Research can continue to evolve on this platform we're going to be supporting all the latest application domain specific uh um uh Network architectures and all of the data loading necessary and we make sure that it's super super fast this framework literally allows you to train models across thousands of gpus essentially automatically no longer do you as a domain scientists in your domain have to think about all the computer science that has to go on below it we've taken care of it in the framework and you can see here the results are fantastic we experience essentially near linear scaling for training these models we are early days most of the models that I talked about today are in the singled digit billion parameter model size we're hitting well over trillion parameter model size in the language space you know that biology is going to take us there and this framework is in an effort to help us get there yesterday we announced a really really exciting effort with uh the novo nordis Foundation we are partnering with them to help them build out Denmark's AI uh Sovereign an AI Sovereign Innovation Center at the core of this Innovation Center it's going to bring together um Denmark's industry uh industry leaders as well as researchers to collaborate on bringing generative AI to Denmark for Denmark okay they're building up a gigantic AI supercomputer it's based off uh the Nvidia djx uh superod 191 uh dgx h100s so over 1500 uh h100 uh gpus in there with our our new Quantum andaban interconnect so it can do that in network compute that Jensen talked about yesterday it's going to be something like the top 500 supercomputer one of the largest in Europe and that Central instrument is going to be a way for um you know our collaborative agreement to bring like I said all of this amazing software in a to-go box into the Sovereign walls of a country to enable Denmark and its researchers and Industry to uh really really expand and and accelerate Innovation and boost their economy and one of the most important areas we're going to be working in is in in the area of of drug Discovery Precision medicine and also Quantum Computing so this is an incredible um an incredible effort and we look forward uh to really pushing um into new spaces here drug Discovery the Holy Grail I would say of of this digital biology data is so that we can understand enough of the complex biological system so we can apply it to something that something in large part is a medicine either you know hopefully we can get to preventative but we're still in in the phase of we have 10,000 or so unmet diseases in the world and so we're trying to understand biology deeply so that we can find new medicine this is essentially an infinite search problem at the get-go right people don't always understand unless you're in the domain just how complicated this is there are over 10 to the 60 potential chemical compounds in the world that's more than particles in the universe and you're trying to find that one that is the right medicine for me or for a group of me that have a similar disease not only that there are a lot of new therapeutic classes that are also protein based and guess what there's 10 to the potential 160 160 potential proteins out there that could potentially be a therapeutic if you think about that and an all by all we we're done and so if you think about how drug Discovery has been done over the last many decades decades it's very much an empirical science it's a lot of wet lab experimentation deep analysis by Deep experts with many many decades of expertise building on many many decades of a previous uh failures and successes of drugs and so because this is so difficult computational method methods have been applied and and CPUs were were one way to apply those computational methods but they really could only get us so far and so back when we invented Cuda the one of the very first places that we went with Cuda as an application space was in the area of molecular Dynamics could we simulate physics-based simulation the ability to understand how drugs and and proteins interact and that got us a little bit further into being able to search this space but we're really looking for how can we go much much further and I would say we're right at the beginning to be convinced that we're going to be able to search far and wide into the space with lots of innovative ways so recent breakthroughs in AI are literally touching each and every phase of this process um really really cool work um has happened uh at Stanford they built uh a very it's it's called a state space model these are one of these incredibly new and and capable especially in the area where you're talking about a three billion long genome and hundreds of thousands of long you know um proteins um these State space models can really accommodate some of that for this long range reasoning and hyena DNA from Stanford is actually doing that um Transformers as you know uh Google Deep Mind and the alpha fold moment is is profound um and you're going to see more from them and and and this is this is this is Nobel prizewinning uh breakthrough that triggered all of us to really believe you can now start representing biology and a computer and it does have very powerful Downstream predictive capabilities um we have diffusion models that can help us model complex behaviors right like diff do uh the the researchers at MIT and diff do and so diffusion models now are being invented across the space to really think about um lead optimization and and some of the other areas in in in um drug Discovery and then as I talked about geometric deep learning really being able to model these these complexes um we have a a fantastic partnership with company I Amic and we helped co-develop this neurop plexer which is a machine a physics informed machine learning algorithm for those protein linging complexes so these these generative AI methods are impacting literally every single um part of the discovery process and so announcing today is going to be a whole bunch of Nvidia nms Nvidia inference microservices that can be applied across Ross this very complicated drug Discovery process and really we're trying to open the aperture of places we can look for drugs and then we can continue to use these models to uh fine-tune their properties and then you know go into experiments with a lot lot more honed understanding and intelligence about what we're putting into experimentation and in fact the team at at amen takes and uses all those models up front does the experiment comes back around and injects that learning back back in and so we're going to be announcing a bunch of these Nims um I think we have over a dozen or so uh and I'm going to talk you through it um these Nims again take these very powerful AI models coming from three places some of them are invented by Nvidia some of them were curating from the open source because they've had very profound impact and some of them are our partners breakthrough models that they also want to make available to the research Community we package it up we we build all the AI inferencing into it we build it into a standardized API so that literally can be deployed into minutes into applications or configured into more advanced applications for the drug Discovery process and so it's biion Nemo to go that's all you need to remember bioo to go is NVIDIA nms and all of these models are coming your way if we can think about what microservices are as I said they're essentially these applications that can be composed into much more complex but very very capable applications this is an example of using um generative AI for virtual screening and I want to show it to you in action virtual screening for new medicines is a computationally intractable problem existing techniques can only scan billions of compounds and require days on thousands of standard compute nodes to identify new drug candidates Nvidia Bemo Nims enable a new generative screening Paradigm using Nims for protein structure prediction with Alpha fold molecule generation with MIM and docking with diff dock we can now generate and Screen candidate molecules in a matter of minutes MIM can connect to custom applications to steer the generative process iteratively optimizing for desired properties these applications can be defined with biion Nemo microservices or built from scratch here a physics-based simulation optimizes for a molecule's ability to bind to a Target protein while optimizing for other favorable molecular properties in parallel MIM generates high quality drug-like molecules that bind to the Target and are synthesizable translating to a higher probability of developing successful medicines faster biion Nemo is enabling a new paradigm in drug Discovery with Nims providing OnDemand microservices that can be combined to build powerful drug Discovery workflows like denovo protein design or guided molecule generation for virtual screening Bono Nims are helping researchers and developers reinvent computational drug design yeah it's pretty amazing so what we're making available today is you can see our our Nims road map is essentially here I wanted to share it with you all so you know where we're headed um we have Nims that are going to go across this entire process the ones in bright green are available today to experience on ai. nvidia.com go get them the ones in white are right now in Early Access as our Bemo cloud apis and they will be coming to the ai. nvidia.com uh um website soon and those in Gray are those that we're working on um we're working as you can see really really hard to expanding into um all of the great work that's happening in protein design so adding um Al fold multimer and open fold multimer coming and the protein mpnn and the uh RF diffusion models so these are really really powerful um so that we can expand and and really want to make U microservices available not just for small molecule but for all the therapeutic classes that are well underway and you can see above the top it's just there's so many workflows that can now be composed because these Nims um are readily available we're super excited uh that we uh announced this week that we are working with cadence so if you know open eye uh software not open AI open eye software been used for decades in the drug Discovery industry um they have a really really fantastic um molecular design software platform um so it's the Cadence molecular um molecular Sciences group and they are integrating all of Nvidia Nims right into their cloud-based SAS and what this does is instantaneous provides this generative AI capability to the drug Discovery users of their platform right in their native work right they're not having to exit out into any other application it's coming right into it and and that's the power of apis you know is being able to instantaneously bring them into um application platforms and we're delighted to work with them they are in over 18 of the top 20 Pharma companies and uh this is going to be a really fantastic going forward their Orion platform is wonderful and now has uh in gener AI uh integrated into it the bio EOS system is is amazing I sure I can't see many of you because these lights are very bright but I'm sure many of you are here in the audience with us um we have connected with over 2500 AI startups in the healthcare ecosystem through our Inception program many of those are in this new class of companies that is emerging because of digital biology and generative AI this new class of companies we call Tech bio these Tech bio companies are pioneering some of the most incredible digital not only the digital capturing capabilities but also applying these modern methods of generative AI Computing to discover new things about biology and new medicines and so over 100 companies in that ecosystem are well underway using and integrating biion Nemo um and so we're excited to to power this this great e system and it's been a wonderful Journey um and we're just getting started all right we're going to switch gears out of out of drug Discovery into the delivery of Health Care um you can imagine that um a lot of the work that you do in any this is this this model here is is really for anybody who is applying themselves to do some amount of work to to complete a task but the the notion of perception in medicine is such a powerful one which is why from the GetGo Nvidia started our work in imaging Imaging is such an important modality in healthcare for the you know start to the to the end of of the patient journey and so perception is such an important place where we we can continue to innovate and apply energy and bring the ability of AI to it it helps doctors reason well guess what with natural language processing we're going to be able to up that reason reasoning even more by uh automatically synthesizing a lot of the information about patients or what's recently happening in the literature so that we can again continue to help them make the best decisions possible and so general of AI meets Medical Imaging um we've been working with GE Healthcare for over a decade and a half uh they recently pioneered uh a New Foundation model called called Sonos Sam and this uh Foundation model automatically tracks organs and structures and lesions across images completely simplifying and speeding up um ultrasound analysis uh Phillips Healthcare developed Philips Phillips Mr smart speed this um model actually decreases the scan time of MRI by up to three times and if any of you had an MRI you would welcome this um and additionally it also helps improve the image quality um something like the resolution by 65% as you know MRI is somewhat noisy data but they're increasing that resolution by 65% um for um really great Downstream analysis endovision is developing cerebro using uh deep learning for video understanding so that they can help doctors especially during any kind of GI um any kind of GI procedure essentially make sure that there's no part of your Anatomy that's gone unex unexpected uninspected you want the doctor to see everything when they're in there uh so they don't have to go back again and they're resolving everything that they can see so um generative AI is here and it's and it's great for medical imaging for guidance for enhancement uh for inspection purposes and many things more we have an amazing collaboration with IIT Madras and their computational brain research they are announcing this week and their downstairs or excuse me across the hall in our exhibit hall um with their incredible new brain research platform called at IIT mados is literally Imaging the brain at the cellular level 100 about a 100 brains I think they're up to 50 today going to a 100 creating not each Brain image has well over between two and three pedabytes of data we've worked with them to um digitize that data and be able to visualize that data in its complete volume at any kind of slice level that you wish at any kind of resolution all the way down to a half a micron this is a a neverbe done uh type of data set um this data is so complex we're going to discover new things about the brain that we never have before they're making this globally available and they're doing some other amazing things so that we can expedite researchers exploration and understanding about the brain um they're going to use monai and they're using monai to segment the brain so that it's very easy easily navigable and you can understand um what these anatomy and these pieces are in the brain and then they're also doing something that is very very helpful is they're putting a chap front end on it and this chap front end does everything from connects to all of the last 10 years of brain research so you can ask it questions and it can summarize for you on a very evidence-based manner what are the papers that are talking about this partic particular phenomenon they uh you can you can ask simple questions about the brain you can ask it to launch the visualization of the application and this team is just getting started um so you can sign up for Early Access to neuro Voyager just across the hall guys go see it this is what is going to be made possible um because of all the AI technologies that we can pile on to it a whole new era of brain research um is being unlocked with this platform so um congratulations to the IAT Madras team and they they're they're hard at work uh and they're making this available for you know we studied the heart the last 50 years and and Eric's here we're really good at the heart now we've got to get to the brain this platform is going to be a huge enabler for us to help the world understand a lot more about the brain we need to hurry up because I'm on the second half here okay okay um so also um because Imaging is so important we similarly want to help this industry continue to to make the kind of breakthroughs we need and use artificial intelligence in new and magical ways so we are announcing a whole host of turning monai which is an awesome open source collaboration and turning that into microservices so it's very very easy to use um we have Nims that can be deployed um for at the front end for data curation so we have Vista 3D it's an Nvidia Foundation model for um 3D segmentation all Anatomy segmentation of and it generalizes across modalities we have Vista 2D that I talked about for 2D segmentation and then we also have Macy and Macy is a synthetic image generation engine so you might not have enough training data and so you can use that all in The Upfront you can also use Nims um at the back and deploy them into your systems we have microservices um for uh AI assisted annotation microservices for training whether it's self-supervised training Auto 3D or um or just optimized training across many gpus and then we even have the microservice um monay has got fantastic traction we have you know well over 25 models in the model Zoo it's had two two more than two million downloads it's um being cited in you know thousands of papers um monay is now the industry standard and we want to just keep making it more accessible and we want to be able to make build it into platforms um and then of course deliver the power of these AI Foundation models where wherever they can be made most useful the ecosystem here again is really really incredible and there's a a new monai ecosystem that is is fast emerging and that is a lot of the software vendors that um build applications for medical imaging again can now use our microservices and build them right in and in fact flywheel who's also um in our Healthcare Pavilion they're really attacking creating a platform to go end to end a complete medical image AI Factory and so they're going to be able to leverage all these AI services with their amazing uh data medical biomedical data platform and now build a whole AI Factory uh with it so go go check them out uh as well we're also announcing that um all these microservices are going to be put in the places you also want them um uh cloud service providers um AWS we've been working with them a long time they have their own um Suite uh of Health Care Services Health Imaging Health omix um their sagemaker platform and even for high performance Computing applications um HPC uh cluster and we're making all of our we've already integrated these Nims into those platform so you can access Bemo and and parab and the uh genomics uh microservices right through you know Health omics when you're there the NIMS are made available right into Sage maker where you might be commonly using and so it's a a great partnership um and we look forward uh to working more with the AWS team we're also announcing uh an expansion of our collaboration uh with Microsoft so we've had uh really fantastic work that's happened over the the last couple years um Nvidia dgx is in Azure and gotten a lot of momentum um from the drug Discovery Community who's building Foundation models and we're going to be continuing to expand um into bringing Nims and deploying Nims integrated into the Azure AI uh platform uh just as well so really really great um platforms and as I said Nims give us the capability to literally deploy this capability to to to take generative Ai and get it to you wherever you are okay digital surgery what an exciting time digital surgery it seems like a common name for me but as I read the research literature it's not actually a well-defined term and not that I'm going to Define it well but I find it in the ways that we look at it and it's it's really the ability to use um data Ai and analytics to drive really fantastic optimizations in the workflow or capabilities in the surgery workflow as you know surgery workflows start from preoperative surgeons have to do a ton of preparation they have to be trained on whatever instruments they might be using they have to know and think about and and and kind of memorize the 3D Anatomy that they're about to go um you know um operate on interoperative they're literally making thousands and thousands of decisions throughout that process and then postoperatively there's a lot of work to do just in summarizing um everything that happened in the surgery as well as surgeons do a ton of work um watching their own surgery so they can improve for the next time and so there's uh this ability now to take artificial intelligence and apply it across some really cool work um orsy Academy in Belgium um used uh our Hollow scan platform for the first inhuman assisted surgery using real-time segmentation um and a 3D model pipeline to do uh to over you know to do instrument deocclusion as you can imagine when you're you're putting an instrument um it gets occluded and so they're using AI to De olude that and this is actually a really really big breakthrough um to be able to apply you know augmented reality in the uh operating room arasmus Medical Center kind of built on top of that breakthrough and they have a realtime AI um and augmented reality to create essentially a GPS for surgeons so projecting virtual images as you can kind of see in the background there I didn't want to gross anyone out early in the morning some of us are good at looking at these images others not um but but they're really really overlaying all this information and and virtual images um on top of blood vessels so they can really help um with the Surge and navigation during you know for example here in a lung surgery Moon surgical um as you saw in the video perhaps um they give surgeons an extra set of arms and then they use real-time computer vision so that the scope control can move as the surgeon is moving so the surgeon doesn't have to take their hands off the instrumentation this is incredible and then medronic as you know we announced um the world's uh largest medical device company they're using Nvidia holcan and our igx platform to to power metronics realtime AI oscopy module um for AI assisted colonoscopies so we built this platform in video holcan to really unlock this D digital surgery era a lot of what you do intraoperatively has to be real time and so the first problem we solved for was the hardest and that was doing the real-time processing you can go from any sensor in to screen out in 10 milliseconds you can apply 30 algorithms to that stream and see all that in 50 milliseconds it's really really quite stunning we built not only the computer so we built the igx compute platform we made it so that it's medical grade 60601 it's not certified it's medical grade we work with Partners you can see several of them in our Healthcare Pavilion they have a complete little system like that that is fully certified medical grade so you as developers or those that that are you know healthare companies delivering Health Care applications to the surgeons can think about the application you don't any longer have to think about what chips and systems do I need to build all the system software how you know medical grade we've already done that and then we took it one step further and we built Hollow scan this is the realtime AI sensor processing application framework that sits on top of it and so now you can just drop in your AI algorithms and you can have this real time Hollow scan and GX are much more capable of that they can also um we have all those large language models that we also today or this week announced uh Nims those language models can be deployed on the edge as well so surgeons could actually have a conversation with the computer in the operating room recalling um important information from the health record system for example or I would like to you know bring up the their um preoperative scan so I can you know make sure we're we're in the right place here we're doing the right thing or got everything that I need to get um so this digital surgery platform is going to enable a huge ecosystem and it already is we've been working on this for a couple of years and we work across a huge ecosystem everything from the sensor Partners to the hardware Builders um to the solution delivery Partners um LTS who can help you actually engineer and build this thing and bring it to life um of course all of the application developers um and so we have a huge ecosystem and this platform is really starting to take off we're excited to announce that Johnson and Johnson Medtech is working with us um so that they can scale out this digital surgery or scale out AI for surgery um uh J&J is uh essentially in 80% of the operating rooms around the world they have a very very large surgery ecosystem that already exists and this is giving them the platform to really accelerate the ability to bring more and more applications and it's an open is an open platform where they're going to be developing applications they can work with their thirdparty partners that can devel um build and deliver applications uh for the O and so just as I described the opportunity for digital surgery that sort of pre- during and post is just there's the possibilities are essentially endless and now we have the compute platform to do it okay generative AI meets digital Health we have just a few minutes left um digital Health has gone from being Predictive Analytics into this because of GPT this ability to generate work and do work on our behalf okay generate clinical notes clinical decision support do summarization build a whole bunch of virtual assistance and so I want to give you a flavor of this next gener generation of digital Health that is right in front of us we have the capability now with because of the architecture of large language models to do three things one the models have the ability to generate two we've built the tools so that there's something called reinforcement learning with human feedback it aligns these models to have the ethical um ethical understanding and ability to act like we would as humans and then third it's augmented with data so the hallucinations are minimized if not eliminated and so let me give you some examples I see that digital health is going to be the thing that helps make a hospital a whole Hospital become an AI we're now going to be able to take all the data that sits in the information systems or is coming from any kind of sensors they could be cameras they could be microphones they could be medical devices and apply artificial intelligence arite is an incredible partner they're using multimodal AI so um you know Vision language models so V video and doing video understanding we uh are announcing today in Early Access a video analytics intelligent Analytics Mo Foundation model that can summarize what's being seen in the in the images and here they can use it for incredibly important applications like virtual care and smart operations you know patient monitoring so patients don't have fall risk again when you can understand what's happening in a video you can truly um come up with Incredible uh applications and arti side is doing that a bridge is another one um what an incredible company they are essentially a generative AI um clinical conversational AI company their first application is medical summarization so here you can see they have a cell phone that sits in uh the office with a physician uh patient interaction they use speech recognition they use a very complicated um you know mixture of Experts of large language models so that they can um summarize that patient interaction and automatically generate the clinical note for the physician this is literally saving Physicians 3 hours a day that's something like 60 or 70 hours a month this is incredible they are integrated right into epic um and this is just the first application that they have going look at those profound um time that we're giving back uh to the Physicians by applying these amazing Technologies um Hippocratic you saw them a little bit in Jensen's keynote um Hippocratic AI is building um incredible digital Health agents generative AI healthc care agents these agents what's magical about the agents that we're building together with them is that they are they're real time in order for you have a real direct connection with a human the interaction needs to be real time you want to have an impact on you know their care and you want to have them be able to react to you they also these agents that essentially can be always available and so we're going to give you an example of you know imagine you've come home from a surgical procedure you've been given about 15 different things you need to think about when to take your medication how much to eat how much exercise how much sleep don't eat this you know do that a and so you have a lot of questions and it's and and they have this ability to have an agent essentially standing by um this is a super complex system the the amount of technology is pretty jaw-dropping that happening here you're going speech recognition into their 1.7 trillion parameter constellation parameter model this llm has a whole bunch of 19 other supervisor llms so that it's safe so that it has all of your personalized data so it knows information about you it knows information about the drugs that you're taking it even has the ability to go off to a human agent if necessary and then it comes back through a text to speech uh microservice into an audio to face to actually activate um the digital human face so it's just a technology Marvel and we're essentially helping to deliver this in real time and let me show it to you in the full form hi Sarah I'm Rachel your AI care manager how are you doing after your appendectomy you know I'm good I'm glad glad to be home with my dog Dennis it's great to hear that you're back home with Dennis I noticed that Dr changen has prescribed you some antibiotics specifically ciprofloxacin and metronidazol due to your ruptured appendix were you able to get these medications I was um I did forget to mention to the doctor that I am allergic to penicillin is it still okay to take the medications great question the antibiotics you've been prescribed cicin and metronidazol don't contain penicillin so it's perfectly safe for you to take them can you begin taking them today yeah I certainly can um do you have any tips for a faster recovery given that you have diabetes keeping your blood sugar levels in check will be beneficial for your wound healing your hemoglobin A1c was at a healthy level of 5.5 but your glucometer readings from yesterday were a bit on the high side so keep taking your metform in and try to steer clear of foods high in carbs how does that sound to you uh I think I'll be able to to avoid the carbs for the week um you know I need to go right now but it was great talking to you I'm glad we had this talk I'll pass along your progress to Dr Chang goodbye goodbye stunning stunning and you can experience hypocritic Ai and you can talk to Rachel her name is not Diane it's Rachel uh you can talk to her in our booth and you will be blown away um incredible work guys we're over time um I just want to close with generative AI this is a technology leap for healthcare these domains of digital Health digital biology and digital surgery are going to be completely transformed and you can see it already here at GTC you they are being built and empowered by Nvidia AI microservices you can experience them and take them in near Togo box from ai. nvidia.com okay just quickly um we don't hear it from me only we have an incredible set of speakers um shortly here is going to be Priscilla Chen um I have an amazing panel with Kathy Wood Eric toppel and Peter Lee this afternoon uh mjal sha from the CEO of hypocritic the demo you just saw he's speaking tomorrow at 10:30 so please check the schedule this is an incredible lineup of speakers and you're going to be as inspired as I am I think um we have a special Healthcare pilion this year so all the demos I just touched on they're all in the healthcare Pavilion just walk straight towards the back where you see the big Nvidia booth and it's just in front of it and you can see all of these incredible thank you sponsors thank you partners because we are showing what the future of healthcare looks like here at GTC thank you very much have a great one",
