  "transcript": "hey everyone welcome back to yet another installment in the UniFi fundamentals series here on the simple Network YouTube channel this is video number four in the series so if you haven't watched the first three videos yet I highly recommend you do so especially if you are looking to get the full rundown on UniFi and you want to be prepared for today's Topic in this video we are going to be focusing specifically on the unify talk application by the end of this video you will have a basic understanding of the UniFi talk application how it works and how you could go about setting it up for yourself I don't like wasting time so let's pop our networking hats on and get started so UniFi talk is yet another piece of software in that UniFi software suite we keep talking about and it's used to manage the UniFi line of Voiceover IP desk phones as well as the UniFi talk Subscription Service which is a sip service like many other UniFi products it's very much designed to be an all in-one solution where you don't have to leave the ecosystem to get everything you need management of the talk application and its Associated devices is the same as with UniFi Network and protect you get that polished and easy to usee management interface I won't harp on that too much as we've been over it you should kind of get the idea by now ubiquities marketing suggests that UniFi talk is a plug-in play solution which I actually think is fair it's certainly very easy to get going and can be deployed extremely quick quickly provided you have the proper planning one of the best parts of UniFi talk is its significant integration with other applications including UniFi protect and UniFi access in terms of UniFi protect we uh have which we have already covered in this series you can view your security cameras right from your UniFi desk phone which is pretty neat that could possibly eliminate the need for dedicated security monitors and things like that and when you combine that with UniFi access integration which we have not covered yet but we will in a future video you would actually not only be able to see who is at your front door with a doorbell security cam or something like that but you could also unlock the door and allow them entry into the building right from your UniFi desk phone very neat Integrations that we will not be getting into in the fundamental series here but will certainly be topics for future videos on the channel so stay tuned how does it work well it works almost exactly the same as UniFi Network and UniFi protect you're going to adopt your talk devices in this case desk phones to the controller through the UniFi talk application and once adopted you'll handle all device management settings propagation policy and firmware updates through the UniFi talk interface you should be seeing a pattern at this point right it's the same idea over and over again just for a different set or different line of devices in this case the only difference that I would mention during the setup process is that in my experience the adoption of the desk phone seemingly happens automatically that's not an advertised feature or anything purely anecdotal just keep that in mind if you can't find where to adopt your phones they may have already been adopted and just in case you were wondering there is no companion mobile app for this application which kind of makes sense there doesn't really need to be one in terms of deployment like with unified protect we are looking at Hardware only deployments that's right once again there are no Cloud hosted or self-hosted software options for this application UniFi talk can only be run on supported consoles and Cloud gateways this is likely because a fully cloud-hosted Voiceover IP solution uh May tend to have very high latency I've certainly experienced that myself and it's also worth mentioning that there is also no dedicated Hardware controller for UniFi talk like there was with the UniFi protect NVR so there's no dedicated controller device in this case it's consoles and Cloud gateways all the way as is tradition now let's take a look at a live demo of an inroduction instance of UniFi talk so you can get a general idea of what the interface looks like and how it works all right so let's take a look at a live in production version of UniFi talk once again we are at my UniFi site manager here um and we've got my UniFi cloudkey Gen 2 plus running UniFi talk for us so we can go ahead and click on the talk application and right off the bat you're going to notice it looks very very similar to all of the the other applications that I've demoed thus far so we start out on our dashboard here with just some basic information regarding call usage and call volume so we can see you know how many ingoing and outgoing calls we've had and who our most active users are we also have some basic you know system uptime information like how long it's been up who our service provider is in this case we're using UniFi talk siip and also some basic information regarding how much of our allocated minutes we've used so with UniFi talk subscriptions um each line gets 3,000 minutes per month with the I think it's about $10 a month subscription moving on down to assignments this is where you will assign your desk phones to certain users in this case we've only got three running on this Cloud key and as you can see over here I need to take a look at my system because we've got uh poor good and poor for call experience in the last 24 hours now that's actually because our Cloud key did go offline yesterday for a little while so that's why we're seeing this but that's good information to have it lets you know that hey something with your system's not going right and you can see the phone numbers um that we've assigned to each user on down to engagement this is where you can set up your smart attendant the smart attendant is a very useful feature so this is where you would set up a system where people call into your office or into your building or what have you and they are greeted with an automated voice that tells them press one for this press two for this press three for that you know that kind of thing I'm sure you've heard that before so in this case I've press one for billing press two for programming press three for the IT department and yada yada yada you get the gist and you can get fairly complicated with the smart attendant and you can even choose what kind of voice the smart attendant is using very cool stuff once again we've got our system log and this is where you're going to see literally every call that comes in or goes out or is dialed internally for intercom it also does have some basic SMS features which I'm not going to get too in depth in right now because it's still in the labs environment it's not an official feature just yet but you can see critical information uh such as when the last backup was taken you can see uh event logs for specific devices in my case there are no device events right now which is good we have telepan options logs for telefony we also have billing and admin activity all standard Affair and then in the settings here is where we can activate our UniFi talk subscription so in my case it's $10 a month for a 3,000 minute line that I am paying for through UniFi talk I could purchase some new numbers if I wanted to and you can easily Port over numbers from other services that's what I did when we set up our account in the first place organization information this is where you'll update information regarding your location your address as you can see your business profile here and this is going to help with 911 emergency response as well as branded calling so if you want when you know if if a client gets a call from you you want it to say your organization's name right so you'll want to set all this information up to make sure that's working correctly we have our call settings hold music ring back fun things like that we can have a global voicemail profile that applies to everyone global conts that all phones are able to access as well as our phone designer so that you can provision devices more quickly you know you can provision 10 UniFi Talk phones exactly the same with one phone design pretty cool stuff on to our single deployment example for today's topic you can see it's a very similar setup to what you've seen in the last few videos we are still sticking with the dream machine pro as our Cloud Gateway as it can run the full Suite of UniFi applications and and would allow us to have that integration with protect and access that we discussed earlier in this example we have our dream machine pro running UniFi talk along with UniFi Network UniFi protect and UniFi access you can see we've got our desk phone here connected up to our switch just like any other UniFi device and because we have an active UniFi talk subscription line on our dream machine pro we can take and make incoming and outgoing calls as well as intercom with our fellow employees in the office additionally because our dream machine pro is running UniFi protect and access we can also use our desk phone to view our doorbell camera here to see who is at the front door intercom with them to see what they want and unlock the door for them if we so choose pretty simple deployment for UniFi talk and once again you've done it like I mentioned in the previous video the rest of these videos are going to start to move much quicker as it really is the same concept over and over again applied to a different range of devices seeing as this course is designed to be followed in order I don't want to waste your time spouting the same information over and over again that being said if there is anything you would like more clarity on or you have questions in general be sure to leave them in the comments below I will be down there interacting with you guys also let me know if any of the topics I cover in the series would benefit from an in-depth guide where we go into some more detail as always thank you so much for watching I hope you got immense value out of this video if you did and you want to see the rest of this series as it comes out be sure to subscribe to the simple networks's YouTube channel leave a comment down below if you so wish and if you want to contact me for Consulting head on over to Senda mediate.com cont the link for that will be in the description enjoy the rest of your day",
