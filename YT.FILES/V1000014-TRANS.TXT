  "transcript": "in the year the dc comics released the superhero batman the cape crusader used a gun and actually killed the bad guys but that quickly changed partially because of the book that was written by american psychiatrist frederick wortham published in 1954 he blamed comic books as a serious cause of juvenile delinquency and dc and batman would make the gun go away and have batman stop throwing guys off rooftops and out of windows and turn batman more into a smiling helpful kind of crime fighter unfortunately it also became boring to its readers and even for the kids but in the 1960s cbs was suffering with his ratings and decided to revive the batman character into a television show keeping the comedic angle which became an overnight smash for both the network and for the actor in the lead role cvs moved on after its cancellation counting its money but the actor paid the price this tale of fame and fate tells of that actor he was a tv superhero a playboy an alcoholic dealing with depression a loving father and even the voice of the mayor of a little cartoon city named quahog rhode island this is the tale of mr william west anderson known to us all as adam west william west anderson was born on september 19 1928 to otto west anderson and audrey v speer in walla walla washington his father otto was a dashing hard-working farmer and his mother audrey was both a talented pianist and an up-and-coming opera singer that left her career to raise her family adam west grew up as a happy child that loved to work on the farm he loved the animals riding horses and playing in the fields but his family life may not have been a very happy one at all it seems that even though his mother did leave her career to care for her family it was not a choice that was made without regrets and as time went on she would make everyone more than aware of those regrets audrey did not like life on the farm at all after all milking the cows and feeding the chickens was a far cry from the glamour of the shows in the opera though through it all life would go on in the anderson household but rough times were coming adam started his high school education in walla walla but the family problems at home were starting to show as adam began to start to get into trouble at school so much so that during his sophomore year adam was expelled his mother's life on the farm and her regrets of leaving her rise to fame became too much for her to bear blaming it all on otto making her start a family so adam west's mother and father would divorce and she would soon move her adam and his brother john to seattle it was there that audrey would remarry when she met neurosurgeon paul flothow she was back in the limelight so she thought and now they lived in what many considered to be a stone mansion audrey would continue to try to still be part of that celebrity lifestyle by entertaining famous other celebrities in their home but it was becoming evident that the family was not close at all and audrey suffering from depression and alcoholism would even go as far to tell adam that she blamed his birth for her losing her shot at fame a very hard thing for a young man to have to live with knowing that your own mother thought that you were a curse instead of a blessing [Music] adam had often said later that it was because of this that later in life he felt guilty for the fame that he had achieved adam continued his high school education at lakeside high in seattle where he would win trophies and medals from playing football running track and even becoming a member of the school's drama club but he would get into trouble here once again yes adam would get expelled from here also this time for sneaking out of the dorms after lights out and stealing the keys to the school bus adam and his friend harry hutchinson took the bus and drove it to tacoma so that they could meet up with some female friends to have a party and drink champagne pleading with the school principal adam's parents managed to get the school to let him back in but it came with a hard price to pay for adam he was told that he could no longer live on campus and that he would have to live with the family of one of the school's math teachers who was also an ex-navy officer adam would also have to turn in his athletic letters his trophies and all of his medals during his final years at lakeside the school newspaper described adam as a red hot looking shop dresser he was described as a ladies man with a cool mellow voice the school paper ran a story that took each classmate and compared them to what comic book character they most resembled adam west was said to most resemble superman's alter ego clock kent after graduating from lakeside west went on to enroll in whitman college close to his original home in walla walla he became a member of his father's old fraternity beta theta pi and would major in literature and psychology both of which he would earn a degree in adam west would marry his classmate 17 year old billy lou yeager in his senior year they lived in a small house owned by west grandparents billy worked at the local sears store and adam found work as

report to the base commander when adam arrived the base commander said to adam i hear that you know all there is to know about radio and television stuff scared and lying to his commander adam said yes sir i do it was then he was told that he would be transferred to a new on a closed circuit television project which is what he would do for the next two years of his enlistment after adam was discharged he and billy enjoyed life traveling across europe but soon their money ran out turning to friend kyle hebenstrait for help adam was offered a small pot on a local hawaiian tv show called the kini popo show of which heaven street was the star of adam and billy moved to hawaii and he took the job adam west also would work writing ad copy and manage the flying service for tourists eventually adam took over and became the star of the kini popo show and because of it became quite the local celebrity although billy supported adam's desire to act it may actually have been his newfound fame that would eventually destroy their marriage adam west liked to party and adam liked the ladies often disappearing late at night from the couple's home only to return the next morning clearly exhausted from an all-night party and whatever the couple began to drift further and further apart they would go their separate ways and divorce in 1956 and though later west would refer to it as an amicable divorce billy was indeed driven by her feelings of abandonment from adam's infidelity [Music] adam west would meet tahiti born dancer in garage matata frisbee dawson he would call her nah and the two would marry in 1957 they would have two children together a daughter jonelle and a son hunter while vacationing in hawaii a hollywood agent happened to see west in a local playhouse and told him that he looked the cowboy type and suggested that adam send some pictures to him in hollywood it wasn't long before adam west got a call from warner brothers studios and was offered a contract that was the last time that anyone had heard of william west anderson adam packed up his family moved to l.a and changed his name to adam west westerns had just taken over an american culture

made it off the ground called alexander the great the couple have been married for five years the actual reasons behind the downfall of their marriage are pretty much unknown as west has never really mentioned it but it has been rumored that it was adam's constant absence from her and their children that slowly broke them apart there also was a lot of gossip about his drinking and his attraction to the opposite sex that surely must have played a big role in the decision for the couple to break up after the divorce adam continued in his television acting roles and in 1965 adam landed the role of captain q a sort of james bond-like secret agent type that got his energy from drinking nestle's quick chocolate milk mix this was the beginning of adam west the crime fighter adam auditioned for a new cbs show that the network hoped could save their failing ratings based on the comic book batman both adam west and lyle wagoner auditioned for the lead role wagoner was preferred for the role at

parties billboards publications all announcing that batman is coming while this grew a lot of interest for the premiere of the sheries it may also indeed have contributed to adam's fame as being batman and unfortunately his ultimate careers downfall from being typecast he indeed became the unforgettable voice of the caped crusader the batman show became an instant hit and with it adam west because of adam's witty acting style and his ability to ad-lib and bring a mixture of comedy wholesomeness drama and innuendo sometimes all in the same episode adam in the batman series caught the interest and adoration of all age groups he was a crime fighter for the kids that could beat the bad guys a role model for the parents as he preached obeying the law and eating and drinking nutritious foods and a bit of the wild playboy type as adam and the show's writers would take full advantage of the innuendo in suggestion which is what made the show a hit even with the college kids [Music]
