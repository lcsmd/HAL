    "transcript":  "you as a person are moving exponentially better as better this model gets like I I was very powerful with GB3 I was Ultra powerful with gbt 4 I was even more powerful gbt TBO I\u0027m extremely powerful with with Sonet 3.5 let\u0027s assume somebody didn\u0027t see our last video like how would you describe clo engineer to a complete beginner CL engineer is more like somebody is actually listening to you it\u0027s imagine like it\u0027s your desk me imagine you\u0027re working on a project and you have a friend or your coworker next to you and you just throw question it and it answer not only with code and anything that you that you think about it but it also actually creates the file uh so you know what I want to do I want to create a new project and I want this to be a script to download video from YouTube Right nice so I like okay uh create a new project um and uh what we\u0027re going to do uh I need a script that downloads video videos from YouTube at the highest quality real use case that people can use today exactly so now it\u0027s going to do it\u0027s GNA create because this is a because say a project is smart enough to understand that it\u0027s not just a file it\u0027s a folder right so you make this folder it give you the name YouTube downloader right uh also just one fun fact I want to show you uh before we move to the file creation Cloud uh when you run function following is able to what\u0027s this thing called thinking okay which is really cool only class is this so basically every time you ask a question it\u0027s actually thinking first so here I say you know like hey don\u0027t like create a script whatever and this is what his thinking first it\u0027s like oh to accomplish this task I have to do a new folder I have to create a python file have to do a requirement like how cool is that that you can see it\u0027s thinking so if you can go into the YouTube folder now we also the requirement which of course is just P P2 because that\u0027s the the script that we using uh and I like great now is like and as you can see I made it so that every time you have to confirm and this is just a safety thing they just like go but I don\u0027t want that because you know maybe you\u0027re not experienced enough you don\u0027t know what he doing like let\u0027s just like you know make make sure you confirm every time yeah that\u0027s actually one of the biggest concerns that people have with building agents is to like run away agents because I\u0027ve heard people in my community who like experimented you know with um different agent Frameworks like agents considering like illegal activity is like you know it\u0027s better to you know confirm before agent starts like downloading some copyrighted stuff and doing something with it totally and especially like if you\u0027re working with things like python you can actually up your system like really bad right okay we have our project we have the requirements we have the downloader I already have P2 in my platform so on my computer so I don\u0027t have to like use that but let\u0027s just use the script let\u0027s just see what he did so what I\u0027m going to do I\u0027m gonna um I\u0027m gon to open here cursor I\u0027m going to open a new folder um there\u0027s our a script that he made how amazing is that he made it so that we have to enter enter the URL in the console that\u0027s really cool so we don\u0027t even have to like edit the script it already like was like smart enough for us right okay so let\u0027s go to YouTube now and I just pick a random video so I\u0027m going to copy this link and I\u0027m going to say okay run in the terminal you can see he\u0027s asking for the link put the link I press enter for the CER directory Great oh my God you made it so complex I can even name a directory for I\u0027m juster right and boom here\u0027s the video in high quality pretty cool right that has to be the fastest downloader possible CL Cloud engineer baby infinitely faster than any like YouTube to MP4 oh yeah never use like YouTube downloaders just make your own in P it\u0027s the best thing in the world by the way all of the files from this video as well as all my other videos are accessible in my community and if you join in the next 24 hours I will build you a custom GPD for any use case you want so make sure to take up this offer because it\u0027s only available for the next 24 hours it\u0027s the first link in the description now we can even say like okay love the script but uh you know make it so that uh when you download the videos actually make a folded with the name of the video like we can like do all things like that right but I guess you know for now this is like I just want to show you like Python and now we\u0027re gonna move on into a new project which is like HTM HTML CSS that kind of stuff right so one okay this was amazing uh amazing I always love to say great job because you know why not it was a great job it\u0027s like there\u0027s like two big trends I\u0027m noticing one of them is you know it\u0027s more and more agentic so obviously you can use cl. AI you can use C gbt but they are not creating the files you know they\u0027re not really like working with you and the second trend is moving towards prompts where you don\u0027t have to like prompt everything it just understands stuff and does on its own exactly that\u0027s because the the the when you start a new instance of cloud engineer everything you\u0027re saying in the chat is being like is remembering so every message you\u0027re sending is so like toen window yeah exactly until like you run out uh that\u0027s something I might want to add in the script which is like see how many tokens you left because you know that would be good but that\u0027s very easy to do it just doesn\u0027t doesn\u0027t take too long this is especially good to keep an eye on like what is writing you know understanding the basics because you see here what\u0027s writing too which is pretty cool right um and so you can see in advance what what\u0027s writing so you can kind of see like you know what what this thing is going so in a way if you like already recognize there something that you don\u0027t like let\u0027s say I didn\u0027t like the background color of the game I could already be like hey actually you know what like change the background color to this right okay and now finally the GS so now because it\u0027s an index file I can just double click and it will just open right boom look at that game start a game uh let\u0027s start a game oh okay let\u0027s see can you see it yeah yeah oh my God oh my God look he made the he made the thetion color that\u0027s crazy that that is so cool that\u0027s actually by far the best implementation of snake I\u0027ve ever seen and it\u0027s very simple to install so you come on the Appo which is on my GitHub and so what you want to do it\u0027s like you know you can just you know download this folder basically right download the folder and then uh you can either install the requirement if you already don\u0027t have those things install which is antropia colorama you know a bunch of install so the way you will do that that\u0027s the first St app you just do pip install a requirement txt inside of the folder uh that you have and then very very simply you can just run uh the script with like python or Python 3 depending on what you have installed and then the name of the script which is mypi and so I already download uh the script here so I just want to show you like how you can just like run it really quickly so I made a folder here uh that it\u0027s called Cloud engineer and so in this folder as you can see all I have is the script I download because I already installed the requirement I have to do that again and I mean this is even more powerful for people who are beginers to programming because we didn\u0027t even instruct it to you know do do these files it just like suggested in I\u0027m like yeah sounds good continue like that\u0027s literally all we did it\u0027s insane so what do you think like anthropic did was like seems like a huge jump you know on at 3.5 so there\u0027s a lot of rumors um I have one favorite rumors on this so do you remember the cloud gate uh Golden Gate Cloud do you remember that no so anthropic like a like a a month ago so they released this thing that was called Golden Gate Cloud which what anthropic find out is that they can actually um look at what the model knows and steer it toward certain direction um so what they did basically they can almost like they didn\u0027t edit the weights but it\u0027s almost like a weight to edit the weights of the model where the model just becomes better at one thing and so they made it they made Cloud believe it was the Golden Gate Bridge it was actually really funny so they had it on the app for a few days so you could say things like um acloud um you know like uh you know what do you think it\u0027s the best bridge in America and he would say like oh of course it\u0027s the Golden Gate is the Golden Gate Bridge it was like so funny or like every time you ask it for let\u0027s say I ask hey give me a python code for you know ordering numbers and he would be like oh the best number in the world are uh you know two because that\u0027s the Golden Gate it was so funny like like this model was like obsessed with the Golden Gate it was really funny to play with and so my theory is they did something similar towards intelligence it\u0027s almost like the fear the model ability just be more intelligent by yeah activ s part of the model this is pure supposition of my because I\u0027m like how do they make this jump so fast I mean maybe they just like kind of found how to you know ignore the dumb part of training data because you know most of training data is kind of low quality tokens so obviously we don\u0027t know but yeah I mean if it\u0027s somehow steer towards intelligence and like you know better activate the smart Parts smart neurons yeah and so that\u0027s my idea or uh they were just training this for a while and we just know about now and you know and there was actually an interview by um amod the the CEO of anthropic like a couple yeah and he was like um there basically is saying we found no reason to believe that we are plateauing in terms of like the more data because you there\u0027s a big meme right now that like those system have reached Max capability yeah no but that\u0027s like the opinion like now right it\u0027s like it\u0027s like there\u0027s like there\u0027s like two School of thoughts like some people say it\u0027s top some people say it\u0027s not but he\u0027s saying like oh no no no we have not top which makes me believe uh the things they\u0027re seeing are pretty crazy right and so I I mean you know for sure anthropic already has oppos 3.5 they already been playing with it I mean that it\u0027s going to be insane right so why do you think like anthropic is progressing so fast because you know we\u0027ve all seen the release date chart where the CLA just like out you know out improves gbd yeah so my theory and this is just theories of course like I know I can\u0027t speak for those companies is like I think anthropic is really focus on making those models better while open AI focus on the on the user experience right for if you saw yesterday open AI came out with this announcement they say hey we actually uh you know delay the release uh G for all with voice because safety basically that they didn\u0027t say safety but that\u0027s the reason and I think my theory is that they can turn down the sexiness part of the voice they can\u0027t have the voice not being like you know a little sex yeah right seductive and so I hate that because not sorry I don\u0027t hate the fact that it\u0027s stop it what I hate is that you know I I even wanted to tweet yesterday I wanted to be like hey open AI I don\u0027t care about user experience I don\u0027t care about you know this model has magical experience I can talk just give me something that it\u0027s smart right because to me that\u0027s life like like Cloud 3 Sonet for me is a is a point that it\u0027s lifechanging right it\u0027s a point that\u0027s making better huge right and so just give me something that it\u0027s lifechanging I don\u0027t care that it\u0027s magical I just want something that\u0027s life changing right and so I think open ey right now it\u0027s very focused on these experiences how do we get the next 100 million 200 million 500 million users right and anthropic I think is more focused on Enterprise you can see yesterday they release a project which is really cool uh I think they\u0027re just more into like okay let\u0027s just make those model better for the sake of be better and I don\u0027t know what\u0027s the right approach on the long term definitely opening eyes doing well from a pure customer perspective yeah but I like anthropic approach the other thing will say and this is something I\u0027ve been discussing all with my friends and I\u0027m and I\u0027m I\u0027m actually glad you brought up this question because I\u0027ve been thinking about this a lot it\u0027s this idea and this is gonna be a little complicated to explain but I feel that you know if you know how to use those tools let\u0027s say you know you you spend some time now you use cloud engineer you get familiar how to talk how to deal with it the things you want to say like how to you know use it better every time a new model drop you are getting better yes it\u0027s it\u0027s almost like you as a person are moving exponentially better as better those model gets like I see myself you know like I I was very powerful with g53 I was Ultra powerful with gbt 4 I was even more powerful gbt TBO I\u0027m extremely powerful with with with Sonet 3.5 right it\u0027s the smart smarter concept say it again it\u0027s the smart get smarter concept from BAGI exactly that\u0027s it right and so I think like you need to start using this thing like deeply and understand it because don\u0027t get scared they\u0027re like oh there\u0027s a smarter model it\u0027s better than humans no like you are getting better as the model gets better because it\u0027s it\u0027s almost like um and it\u0027s funny because we never have an example in in history to explain this because let\u0027s let\u0027s let\u0027s say this right let\u0027s say that you know I\u0027m driving like a regular car right and then I buy a Ferrari the only difference there is I\u0027m moving faster but I\u0027m not a better driver right with this it\u0027s almost like you\u0027re getting you\u0027re becoming a better driver yourself and you\u0027re getting faster right and so it\u0027s a very interesting um thing that I never think we\u0027re seen in the history of humanity because this is the first time that we are Comm like we\u0027re making intelligence a product right and then that was never the case it\u0027s the first time you can become more intelligent as individual ever human exactly yeah I mean it\u0027s just like equalizes you know even if you\u0027re not like intelligent biologically if you learn how to use these models you can destroy somebody who was like more IQ than you purely because you\u0027re leveraging technology ex exactly and and and you know I like to bring back this example like from the first time we spoke which was like uh you know at the time I I you know I would say I\u0027m I\u0027m a decent developer I\u0027m not the best but I\u0027m a decent developer and I\u0027m sure there\u0027s better people than me around it and I won the entropic uh developer challenge because I developed my estro with oppus you know like like my estro help me out sorry oppus help me out my estro and I won the you know the whatever the credits that that I now I\u0027m using the credits that I want with anthropic developer to give all those things right um but one thing I wanted to show you before we we wrap up is what\u0027s coming next which is the live app that uh which is this is super cool because Sonet took the script that we just saw and build the live app basically um and so I\u0027m going to run this and so the difference between this and my and and engineer yes it\u0027s the same thing the difference this is runs as a UI app instead of running in the terminal open the link here and so you can see this is a full app can you see the can you see it well yeah and so this works exactly the same way uh so I can say hello and it but the difference like this is super cool because it\u0027s a chat and I can say make the SVG of a dog so that that\u0027s all the things that we just saw in the demo just better because it\u0027s a UI so it\u0027s a much easier to use um so I\u0027m gonna like you know what\u0027s your plan with this I want to release this um not sure when not sure how this also has artifacts so you can look at the file and then you can oh it\u0027s doing the C data can you explain the artifacts for people don\u0027t know so basically artifacts uh is um this thing that anthropic made that just lets you visualize the coding file and there\u0027s only a few type of file they can visualize HTML MD file typescripts file and uh SVG right uh so in this case we made this SVG and now we can preview it\u0027s reallyy funny right uh or I can say like R um right uh uh Manifesto V save AI as an MD file so MD will be your markdown file right and those are the one that have like bolds and and and like the H1 H2 like all those like you know the headers like all this kind of stuff um and uh and so I want to show you this because I show you that that\u0027s another file that\u0027s previewable uh same as the SPG the HTML okay so the Manifest so you see like you have all this like you know the asterisk and all this stuff but then when you preview it just becomes a nice yeah for um but this one actually the image should work so let\u0027s just put back the meme because and see if this this works okay see how cool is this should be show the image what is this and why is funny look at this the image part of thei language like how smart is this guy the Centra figure Cloud show a regular Divine entity sitting on the throne anthropic Cloud blah blah blah surrounder it\u0027s like gb5 long uh the humor stems from talking to comp mother and dramatizing SE most religious scene of devotion and ychy that is insane really good right and then I can remove I can keep talking about this image or I can remove it right I mean it\u0027s funny because now I feel like I have a superpower like everything I\u0027m gonna code from now on I\u0027m using this which is which is crazy right um and it also has project so you can like toggle between projects too so like you know this is one project and start a new one like I guess you know you you obviously are using CL engineer but before you built it how did you use Sonet 3.5 you use the you know console went to Cloud yeah I went to Cloud Ai and um right here I just like yeah I just ask a question here so basically this is this is how I did it uh actually this would be interesting for people to see I I build Cloud engineer with Cloud nice uh so uh what I did they change the UI where is the console they used to have like a console I just use console. enr.com yeah that\u0027s the there you go so uh what I do is so I go into every time I start a new project with a this is what I do I go in the documentation right and so I look at the documentation I like okay I need to find a way where um Cloud does function call I was like great it\u0027s right here right so literally this is what I do I come here I make sure python is selected because I always start as python sometimes they have different they have different code and so I\u0027m just going to start and make sure that it\u0027s all python seems like it\u0027s all python here example example result Tool uh invalid name switch single oh you go so I\u0027m setting python here and I\u0027m going to select python to all those things too this one doesn\u0027t need so is this like the way you learn about the latest updates you know reading the documentation following e thropic yeah basically this this is the place where I\u0027m you will have all the information but you can do the same thing with anything let\u0027s say open IOP new tomor right so this is my Approach all the time I come here I just copy this whole thing right and I have like uh a quick keyboard thing now so if I say AB I\u0027m going to zoom out here so you can see it better um so if I say um the word absorb it transform into this absorb this code deeply sure understand it works soak in the code in the feature and then I say wait for my request right so I pop all the API and so now Cloud 3.5 son is going to learn about how to use cloud API with uh you know tools which isn\u0027t in the training data you know which which is not in the training data it\u0027s not right so I like great make a Pyon script now um and I I start step by step so make actually now that allows me to chat uh with cloud in the console I would say this is probably one of the biggest mistakes beginners make they don\u0027t realize what is in the training data what isn\u0027t so like it\u0027s almost always you know a good idea to just paste it in the documentation whether you\u0027re using you know anthropic open AI any anything else like that\u0027s programming related they all have docks so just paste it in that way you you know the model knows the latest stuff exactly and I always start by like um like I always start like with everything that I wanted to do like always start from what you want to do and if it\u0027s running out of um like if you\u0027re making a mistake the best thing to do just pop it back in the game because there\u0027s actually I always do that never like you know I knew it worked but now there was a research that came yesterday that says in context chat with long context type with long amount of text is always the best so basically every time just pop the content and gain it always have better results so it\u0027s better than starting over in yeah like you know like if it\u0027s running into into problem like if the script is not working just pop the instruction again it it will do better um so just looking at the code this is correct because now you know I I I have this in my brain like I know exactly like this is correct like if I if I were going to run this oh my God he\u0027s so smart look at what he did he even understood that the best practice when you run function calling is to actually do two two calls of cloud so one calls run the tools and the second call looks if the tools has become successful and that\u0027s what cloud engineer does too by the way but at the time when I was building Cloud engineer I specifying The Prompt I was like hey make sure you do the the second uh call basically when to check if you know the script is correct and he did that th this is right like if I if I was gonna run this and into the API call this will work we should actually try it um I G to do that right now going back into this live engineer Cloud okay I\u0027m going to uh create a new file here test Pi um I\u0027m going to copy my API key now which I will delete after of course yeah guys don\u0027t get too excited so let\u0027s just run this script and see if it works uh hold up how crazy is that yeah built in literally minutes that\u0027s the first step so what\u0027s cool about this it it did add function calling so it had the weather it had the weather call got the weather location but it doesn\u0027t oh he has um has database but let\u0027s see what happen if I ask for the weather why not um give me the weather for New York City of course if you wanted to build this properly you would had the a weather API right this this has mock data I think it so he he used the the tool but it\u0027s not runy because he doesn\u0027t have the you know it\u0027s it\u0027s just like an empty thing basically but it works like we have a chat with cloud and so what you do right now in my case with with a cloud engineer what I say was like oh I just need a function to create a file I function this I just I just did it but how insane is that just like shows that people just need to just do it just do the thing choose an idea and do it like just do the thing like you don\u0027t even have to be good at programming like Sonet will take care of that and like if you get stuck at any point just tell it to like explain the steps you know yeah oh and P and bring like put back the you know bring back the instruction bring back the the context like it always helps the model to be better yeah so I\u0027m just going to like a quick fire a few Community questions from people in my community this is another benefit of being in the community you get to influence what I ask these AI experts on my podcast so in the next 24 hours if you join you will get a custom GPD for any use case made by me so you can automate any part of your work any part of your life and we will build it for you so make sure to not miss this offer it\u0027s only available for the next 24 hours the link is in the description what are some like surprising use cases you found for clo engineer and what are like the near term functionalities you want to add well the the surprising thing was like how well it can distinguish between like the process right and like the thinking thing that we saw before um where it was like oh I\u0027m thinking that to do this this is what I have to do and like I I didn\u0027t even told them to to think step by step it just it just new right um which was kind of crazy so that I loved and then just like how good is in in thinking in terms of system like you know we did very simple example but like I show you what you did with my script you turned into a full app right and that was done with Cloud engineer right um and so the ability to like looking all the files together like understanding like how they communicate to each other it\u0027s it\u0027s pretty cool so it was it was able to do that like really really well okay what are your recommendations for solo entrepreneurs entering the AI space and I cannot stress this enough just build the thing that resonate with you just just do the thing that you want like Cloud engineer you know I post this tweet I was like hey I got you know I\u0027m doing this and I think now it\u0027s like 2,000 like like has like 600 St on GitHub it\u0027s like one of those thing where it\u0027s just like I needed it because I know I needed it and if it resonates with if you if there\u0027s something that you need there might be a high chance that is resonated with other people too so like always build the things that you want to build the things that make you happy right um because this can might turn into a business like for example one one of the things that I think cloud engineering can do really well it\u0027s like some people might not be uh comfortable with the terminal right yeah totally understandable and so that\u0027s why I\u0027m making the app and you know I could I could basically create a new like startup out of there which is like a a consumer approach to coding right because if you see it like a lot of the code like co-pilot and uh cursor like all those other like like agent for programmers it\u0027s for programmers nobody has thought about you know what do consumer wants and I think that\u0027s why artifacts is getting so popular is because it\u0027s a first approach where consumer are actually understanding programming and I think cloud engineer the app it\u0027s basically that right it\u0027s like even more streamlined because you\u0027re actually getting the files too right um and so yeah so I think like you know that\u0027s a good example like I build CL engineer I can make a startup out of day if I want if I want right uh which is is a really cool world we live in very crazy man okay so I want to respect your time petol thank you for um being here again we should do this again in 40 days 50 days when you cook up something you know it\u0027s Cloud uh Cloud God or whatever call Opus engineer hopefully Opus engineer yeah amazing anyways I\u0027m going to leave your Twitter CL engineer Below in the video this in the description so thanks for taking the time man have a great day awesome thank you there byebye yeah",
