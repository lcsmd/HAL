  "transcript": "ah all right where are we we are doing the master class business business Edition so um uh as I bring this up I will oh I see there's a bunch of questions getting spun up already cool yeah so make sure you guys check the check the questions here I'll actually I'll start sharing so I can just show you what it looks like um uh actually come back oh you might not be able to see the Q&A because it's from Zoom okay I apologize um yes but it looks like you guys are figuring it out so make sure you use the Q&A tab any question that you have um you know tangentially related or not to anything that I talk about is fine um go into the QA Tab and make sure you upvote the questions that you find most interesting um and we'll and I'll answer them in order of popularity um I that that seems to work really well and it it gets pretty good pretty good results um but yeah so usually I go for about an hour hour hour and a half until I run out of steam um and uh yeah so let's go ahead and get started thanks everyone for jumping into my bimonthly uh webinar Series so this is I have two so the first one it's first and third Fridays is the schedule that I've got and the first one is more like future of humanity so that's more of a philosophical and you know spiritual or whatever um that's more human Centric and then this the AI master class is going to focus more on the business business side because I still get a tremendous amount of business business questions so specifically it'll be Ai and business um and so I do have a disclaimer while I am talking about business um and the direction that Investments are going at a at a economic scale none of this is investment advice um so I just need to to qualify that that while I will be talking about money and valuations and those sorts of things in no way is this business recommendations and just to to put a cap on that I am not in invested in any of this stuff because it's too volatile uh and that is also not investment advice just that's where I'm coming from so with all that being said um yeah so the Q&A tab I've mentioned this I think you guys are figuring that out U make sure you upload the questions that you want answered and then uh after the end of this short uh presentation we'll get into the into the questions the Q&A section okay so top of the hour the biggest thing is is you guys probably saw the the the figure one uh you know news and Tesla Optimus and there's a few other open source projects we were talking about it in Discord uh but the the long story short is uh by the end of this year we are going to see um if not commercially available like fully production ready robots they're going to be close um and a lot of them are rushing to Market and when you look at how many uh of these companies and there's I mean there's a bunch that aren't even represented here they don't have the Toyota one they don't have the the Ford one um I mean there's there's so many other ones uh out there other companies that are building humanoid robots and so okay so like what does this mean uh well one it's going to be a huge source of data so uh most of these are going to be puppets um they don't have enough enough compute power to run gp4 locally you need a data center for that so these are mostly peripherals uh and a way to think of peripheral it's just like a remote terminal like if your phone connects to something on the cloud yes your phone has some compute power but most of the most of the you know like if you use chat GPT or whatever that's all running in the cloud so these are all going to be cloud-connected peripherals or end points um basically like a glorified Amazon Alexa um from from a from an internet-based perspective obviously they're a little bit more sophisticated a little bit more uh utilitarian than that uh but we're going to start to see very interesting use cases for these very soon now obviously you know doing you know shuffling packages around an Amazon warehouse um last mile is actually where Toyota and Ford um I've seen I've seen some videos of them where basically you know the the the Amazon van instead of having a human walk the package up to the door it'll be a robot will will like literally just walk at the last few and then the robot will like you know connect to the side of the van or whatever we don't know if that'll pan out but that's one of the early use cases um using these for hazardous environments is actually kind of one of the big things where it's it's something where it's not safe for a human to go in so we're talking fire rescue we're talking you know building collapses mines um those sorts of things and I think that I think that we'll probably see some some differentiation in the market there like if you come up with a robot or a platform that's better at those sorts of things um I still see a lot of comments out on the interwebs um particularly on some of my videos where they're like you need to you know electrician and plumber electrician and plumber and Carpenter and I'm like I don't know guys like these we're we're basically building commander data and C3 and all these other droids at the same time I mean they're going to have tools built into their arms uh before too long so we're going to see some Star Wars level droids uh by the end of the year and of course this is just year one uh so keep keep an eye on this space um in terms of what it's going to do to the economics but I mean also it's just a cool time to be alive right I don't know what kind of things this is going to do to the jobs Market it might be that at least in the first couple years and this is pure speculation on my part that the first couple years these are mostly going to be used to do really menial things and dangerous things so it's not really going to impact human jobs um but time will tell now another thing is AI agents are on the rise and so of course there's uh you know GitHub co-pilot and Microsoft co-pilot and everyone is making their co-pilots and whatever else you probably saw Devon the the first you know quote unquote fully autonomous AI developer but I just went to trending on GitHub earlier today and there are three multi-agent platforms forms or autopilots or whatever trending today alone um so like whether it's commercial or open source or whatever I mean this stuff is coming and look at this meta GPT 35,000 Stars GPT pilot 23,000 Stars a fabric which is even newer 8,000 stars like this is like man this is the year of robots this is the year of agents and again this is just year one so keep all of that in mind in terms of what is coming and what is changing in the tech space some of these are going to be directly like job dislocating and so what I mean by that is um once these once these AI developers get a little bit better and it's like instead of instead of having uh you know hiring a junior developer what you're going to basically do is your senior developer is going to have a fleet of these and your the senior developer is basically going to be piloting or uh puppeting them all via you know your slack channels or whatever I actually talked to Microsoft about that almost two years ago and and because they asked me this was when I was in in negotiation to go work at Microsoft actually um and they said like okay if you were if you were a product owner or or a program manager what would you do and I said I would integrate this with with Microsoft teams and I would say that developers um are just going to be puppeting these things from a chat interface I still think that that's the way to go and I think that I think that that using um a a repo Centric approach is the correct approach um because why once you get it into a repo you can deploy it great um some people think that you should go IDE first which still puts the de the human developer um you know kind of front and center and I don't really think that that's economically feasible in the long run um sure there will be AI enabled idees there already are and that will certainly be you know a way of the future as well but where the real money is and and what I mean by real money is for Enterprises to lower headcount it is you know you get rid of your most expensive employees first and this is something that I talked about and it's actually kind of bittersweet because I talked about this a couple years ago where I said you know the most expensive employees are going to be targeted first just because any reduction in headcount of your most expensive employees immediately pays dividends and I you know a year or two ago when I was talking about that it was all hypothetical but now that it's happening I'm like damn I kind of wish I wasn't right about that because like we're we're talking about lots and lots of people are about to lose their job and be forced to Pivot and um something that someone shared on Discord just a couple hours ago was you know secondhand thirdhand leak but basically Sam Alman said that like what was it I think it was GPT 4.5 he expects that it's gonna you know destroy 100 million jobs globally um so it's like it's coming sooner or later uh but anyways so the point point of this is not to like wax philosophic or or sentimental about it but to point out what is happening and what is coming what is coming um in real time now on the other side of this so we talked about the robots and we talked about um the agents so the hardware is something else to be uh looking at and so you've probably seen like there's sah Bross there's the grock trips that's grq not grok not the Elon Musk uh troll chatbot um so you got those chips there's photonic chips there's thermodynamic chips coming out there's Quantum Computing and of course Nvidia is currently the market darling and this is a this is a compound annual growth rate of 40% is what they're currently predicting um so you know again not investment advice um but personally I'm kind of bullish on the AI chip Market just because all of this has to run on some Hardware somewhere um and the the current capacity to run these models is is being underserved so basically like you know what was it I think it was Morgan Stanley really Le a report a few months ago saying that like gp5 was being trained on 100,000 A1 100s or something like that like you know Nvidia stock up and to the right and this is this is projecting out to 2032 I honestly think that this could be conservative I think that the primary constraint is going to be the capacity to build these chips um I think that I I personally suspect that the that the demand for AI chips will far outstrip the capacity for the foreseeable future particularly as the uh economy starts to shape around this new fourth Industrial Revolution but you know again for you know wish in one hand poop in the other we'll we'll see how it pans out it could be much higher it could be much less um but personally I feel my current gut check is that this is overly conservative uh in terms of the the projected future chip size or Market size of AI chips now also on an exponential curve is models so we talked about the hardware you know the the endpoints the agents so basically the two kinds of endpoints are agents and robots um that are going to be consuming the models uh and then the hardware that that the models run on and then the models themselves and so we we were on Moore's Law and now we're on an entirely new law um where this one says doubling every 3 to four month or 3.4 months um which that might be a little fast but I don't know like the data the data Bears it out um and you know we kind of noticed that with uh with gpt2 to three and GPT 4 which model size goes up about 10x every year or every 18 months um so that's much much faster than Moore's Law so that's that's one of the reasons that I suspect that the demand that the need for AI chips will far outp pass our capacity to build AI chips because we are just at the beginning of all of the um algorithmic breakthroughs and scaling laws and everything that will contribute to uh how much smarter these models get and also having been playing with Claude 3 Opus uh for the last uh couple weeks it's weird because when I first started using chat GPT I was like man this is pretty smart and I know they keep nerfing it because they're they're they're I don't know if they're trying to make it cheaper because of the turbo mod I think the turbo model is is substantially Dumber um but Claude 3 Opus it's like it's I'm I can tell that I am talking to something that is nearly as smart as myself um and and that's that was a little unsettling and that's why I made that video of like is Claude sentient we need to have this conversation sooner rather than later so uh but you know and this trend continues for any length of time you know like where is it going to be like these are 10year increments so you go out another few years like it's going to be you know hundreds thousands 10 thousands maybe a million times the AI power that we have today by 2030 or 2032 so I mean you know like like uh like that other channel says what a time to be alive um yeah it's it's it's pretty nuts out there now okay so that's some of the background just looking at the macro Trends leading up until this point and some of the forecast so I actually went and found um a few uh white papers reports that are produced by various places and those PDFs will be attached to the uh the blog post when this video goes live so you'll be able to see where I got this data from um and I I sifted through quite a few it took a while to find like the really good ones but these are updated as of this year so these are these are from white papers from 2024 and so what I want to point out is in this first pie chart um 60% of businesses that were surveyed said that AI will increase productivity and 40% of them are dead wrong uh in my opinion now uh of those of the 60% that said that that they expect it to increase productivity it was broken down where 64% said AI would improve uh productivity and 42% said that it it would streamline uh job processes and so that's kind of where uh some business owners um are coming from and I apologize I don't remember kind of what the cross section was I don't know if these are Enterprise or small and medium business I don't I don't recall but like I said the data that I got this from will be posted now this also goes to this is this is very consistent where I've seen this over several sources so the annual growth the compound annual growth rate I I've seen 37% 38% 40% so it's all in the ballpark we have rarely ever seen a market growing this fast and when you know Goldman Sachs and a few other places say yeah this seems more or less legit uh you know they know more than I do right they spend more time looking at the data and the numbers than I do and I think this one comes from Forbes um so you know you can look up Forbes Goldman Sachs they're all more or less predicting the same thing uh and so that again is is uh there was a question on on Discord earlier and they said is it too late to learn Ai and actually one of the things and I'll I'll show you in a in a upcoming slide is that actually one of the primary things that makes a company an industry leader in AI is investing in AI Talent so honestly I think that now is actually a really good time to get into AI still if you feel like you've missed the bus it's because a lot of us in this room particularly are um ahead of the curve um so speaking of Curves this this data was really interesting so I have been predicting that the fourth Industrial Revolution was going to happen faster than previous ones and this is the first time that I've seen data to bear that out now um this is comparing the digital transformation so this is moving to cloud computing and internet uh you know um internet of things that was TW uh 10 years and now they're calling for AI transformation to take less than nine years I suspect it'll be less than that even um but time will tell uh and basically if you say like okay we're here now and you know basically so the way that I'm reading this graph and it's not necessarily the best graph but basically uh digital transformation is at about 90% complete I've been at many uh companies going through this process and it was painful every single time and I don't know that I agree that the AI transformation is this far along I think that it's more like here so we might still have about six years left but as it's it kind of comports with kind of my intuition that is by 2030 it's going to be like all said and done and I don't mean I don't mean that like you know we're in Utopia and fully automated luxury space communism forever but I mean that the most painful part of the transition will be done by 2030 um there's still going to be the long taale you know the Gartner hype cycle the very long tail of refinement and Improvement and then we'll be just in time for Quantum Computing and nuclear fusion and space travel and so the fifth Industrial Revolution will be happening by like 2040 um probably at the lest we'll see now this other one was in my view was actually more compelling and so the evolution this figure is the evolution of company's AI influenced Revenue share so you look in 2018 uh a very very small chunk of the revenue share was driven by AI so in the in the high percentage 30 plus% down here but then you come up to and now that has like the just the the way that it's trending more and more of company's revenue is going to be either directly influenced or directly dependent upon artificial intelligence enabled processes or Services whether it's inputs you know from the outside vendor-based inputs and you know generating leads and that sort of stuff internal processes uh such as workflow automation that sort of stuff or the final output or you know customer facing aspect we're we should expect this to continue rising and as AI gets better and this continues Rising kind of how I would personally anticipate this playing out is is you're going to see this is going to be supplanted by probably a fourth tier where it's just like post labor like how can we just get head count down um and I did check uh the BLS data so the Bureau of Labor and statistics data uh two days ago and total employment in America is still creeping up so like don't panic yet um there are still jobs and there is still uh in terms of in absolute numbers jobs are still growing um but they are tapering off it is slowing down the growth rate is decelerating um will it Plateau I don't know uh because it would be it would be completely dishonest of me to say ah because it's slowing down this trend is going to continue it goes through cycles and it always has gone through Cycles um where you have you know it accelerates decelerates you might have even have some decline uh for short periods of time but you know the timing to me is a little bit conspicuous um but the the takeaway there is just keep an eye on jobs data um now this this was the most interesting uh graph that I saw in the data and so this this one here my little Zoom tab is in the way there we go so this one is was very interesting and so this is this is that grid and I can't remember what the name of this grid is called There's different people call it different things um but it's basically like are you you um are you uh doing are you uh adopting AI are you doing well and and have you like become a mover in the space and so the AI innovators means that you have differentiated um which means it's like hey we have an AI portfolio but you're not necessarily achieving uh yet and so these are these are people that are kind of you know on the frontier but they're not really you know Market Movers yet and then over here where you've got a good solid AI Foundation but you're not really innovating and then when you have both you're saying okay not only are we uh Pioneers in the deployment and use of AI but we're also achieving and we've got a solid foundation so what this data tells you when only 12% are innovators 18% are Builders and 177% are in that magic quadrant um that's what it was called the magic quadrant um and but 53% are still in the laggards so this really is what told me that uh that we're still very much the early game of AI adoption um in the grand scheme of things and so whether whether you're a a founder or a CEO or a business owner or a VP or a software engineer whoever you are on this call or watching the recording um you're still in an pretty much an ideal place where yes you've you you you might have fallen behind the very you know tip of the sphere but more than half of people are still falling behind and so um the key principles that that that they talked about for Success from this from the same um the same white paper said first and this is what I've always said full sponsorship at the executive level that means the entire SE Suite needs to be on board as well as the you know your your board of advisers or or whatever or your investors because if you don't have full Buy in at the at the top level you're not going to succeed and I think the the number that they said is 86% of of companies in the AI uh High Achievers magic quad 86% of them had full buyin at the executive level um now if you're here watching this you're probably one of those people that has full buyin so I know that I'm preaching to the choir but the second point and they said that this is in many respects more important um in some respects less important but uh was an investment in AI talent and now that is that is bringing in outside talent but also cultivating inside talent and so we're basically in the equivalent of 10 to 15 years ago maybe 20 years ago depending on which Tech sector you're in where there was such a dir of talent that companies had to send people to classes and school because it's like well nobody knows how to do this stuff so we need to we need to have in-house talent development and so by by focusing on cultivating Talent not just attracting it because here's the thing is many Tech many companies either their Tech departments or the tech companies themselves are used to having a talent glut so we've been in a talent glut for a while where everybody knows Python and everyone knows Java and everyone knows Microsoft and VMware and Amazon and everything else the market is fully saturated by people who are experts in the current status quo Technologies however there is a huge dir in people who are qualified to do prompt engineering and uh and generative AI stuff across the board there are even there's even a dir of product owners who even know how to deploy this stuff I've talked to product owners at some of the tech companies who don't even know the first thing about generative Ai and so uh investing in that talent and and one of the things that I've had to talk to some of my uh Consulting clients about is unless you can throw $800,000 at a position you're not going to be able to attract someone from the from the top dogs um Talent poaching is generally not on the table this early in the game because only the big dogs can afford um the people who are really good so what you need to do then is invest in in cultivating the talent in-house that means um you know hosting hackathons and sending them to classes and doing lunch and learns and those sorts of things and then the third thing there's five things that they pointed out but the third thing that was really important was creating an AI Core or a foundation and what I call that is a center of excellence so basically you create your you know your a team or your Alpha Team or whatever um of people that are AI experts and you have this one team that is super super powerful um generally you have someone uh either they're directly under a CTO or a CIO a chief Innovation officer or as what what many are doing is I'm doing a chief AI officer actually having someone at the sea level who reports directly to the CEO whose sole responsibility is understanding and deploying AI at the very least you need an executive vice president who is your head honcho of AI and everyone who reports to them they're the ones going across the entire organization saying how can we use AI to you know do things better faster cheaper safer whatever um can we can we you know lower the bottom line can we raise the Top Line what can we do to to to make things better and faster for the rest of the organization and that AI Core or that Center of Excellence is one of the the the third primary differentiating factor of the companies in this magic quadrant up here of the industry leaders um in terms of deploying AI but because the number is small that means we're still very much in the early game um and the best practices haven't even really been established yet so if you're in this space because this is a question that I still get sometimes is what are the best practices and this is it it is you need full buyin you need to invest in the talent and you need to create a center of excellence beyond that we don't really know yet um because the the we're we're starting an a major major industry transformation um let's see there we go um okay so that's kind of the end of uh that segment and I just saw in the news this was yesterday so Bernie Sanders uh obviously very popular with some people um people analysts suspect that this bill is DOA that it's mostly just for show but Bernie Sanders wants to go ahead and say hey we we we're just going to implement a national 32-hour work week and that's going to be that whoops come back um and but he specifically said because of AI and Automation and so one of the things that I predicted uh and I I I haven't really doubled down on this prediction I think I mentioned it once or twice in a couple of videos but basically what you might expect to see is a way to gracefully transition to a post- labor economy is you you just start to lower the the work week you say hey we're going to do a 4-day work week then we're going to do a three-day work week then we're going to do a two-day work week and this would allow people to have a gradual transition to doing other stuff with their life at the same time um with that extra time they'll be able to find meaning they might be able to find other work or so on and so forth um now is that is that the actual reasoning I don't know I don't know if it's implied I don't know if I'm reading into it but this is the first time that I have seen an American politician specifically call out Ai and automation as a reason to move in this direction if Bernie Sanders is in the audience or watches my videos happy to talk sometime but you know what it is what it is uh anyways so this was very interesting again I don't think this bill is going to go anywhere and Bill Gates has been talking about a 4-day work week for like a decade now and you know but if the if the political climate continues people might say you know what I'm kind of done with work um who knows maybe this will be a really popular issue uh time will tell um I did take a chance I haven't read them in their entirety but I did look through the EU AI act because I saw that it was um it's kind of in its final draft I don't know if it has been fully ratified um but I did see you know final draft and I also looked through uh Biden's executive order on AI and so here's some of the notes that I took um the EU AI Act was um I'll just say disappointing from my perspective it's relatively Bland and basically just treats AI as if it's the new scary boogie monster um it's kind of has a breaks only View and it focuses on classifying you know what are the what level what Threat Level is AI and so it's very much a breakes only a threat model only look at Ai and it kind of only treats like a new Gizmo um I think that the EU AI act just wholesale fails to um understand how transformative this technology is going to be and for instance what it classifies as a high risk and there's only one classification above that which is unacceptable risk any AI That's used for hiring and firing is considered a high risk um if that's what they classify as high risk they do not comprehend what is happening and what is coming um now it's not surprising especially when you consider that the EU is usually a little bit faster to ban things that are harmful um you know certain uh farming practices business practices uh pesticides and those sorts of things the EU is much much quicker to ban things that are harmful than we are in America so knowing that that's kind of the the status quo in the EU it's not entirely surprising that they've taken this route um and you know my bias aside I do think that Biden's executive order is a little bit more comprehensive um so for instance it it it has a lot that directs uh orders directly at the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Commerce to do things such as investigating how AI is going to impact the labor market one way or another um one of the one of the mandates is to mitigate harms and maximize the well-being of workers specifically the EU is mostly about consumer protection it it says that like we want to protect fundamental rights but it doesn't really scrutinize like what those fundamental rights are and it seems like it's mostly privacy freedom of speech and that sort of stuff it's not really looking at it from an economics perspective another thing that the Biden's executive order does is it really wants to advocate for creating an AI ready Workforce and that means investing in education investing in training and that sort of stuff which again um if you look at those those adoption curves it's going to be a few years before before Enterprises are broadly ready to fully adopt and deploy Ai and kind of get it to the maximum uh where it's going to be um but also one of the interesting things was there was a a direction for the Secretary of Labor and commerce to develop programs in anticipation of those Workforce disruptions so they're already contemplating Workforce disruptions in um in in America uh basically saying hey we know that this is going to upset the apple cart first let's study how it's going to upset the apple cart and then also develop responses to this um and then finally the small business administration has been ordered to support small and medium businesses to help with the deployment and implementation of AI uh not just on a technical but how to do it ethically and so on now again both of these are very comprehensive pieces of legislation or or Acts or whatever um they serve different purposes uh and they're different paradigms but between the two I mean there was a few things that that popped up in the the EU AI act that I was like man I I can't really agree with that uh be curious to hear what other people think um and of course America is not perfect I think both of these um underestimate the total long-term risk that AI represents but there's also been some other stuff like coming out of the Pentagon and other places I'm pretty sure the military understands the risk that AI represents um and they're but they're kind of downplaying it to keep it out of the public eye um because and there's a piece of data that I forgot to include but uh uh from 2019 to now uh public trust in America and AI companies has fallen from 50% to 35% um and so that is uh public sentiment is turning against AI right now in America which is I think that that's a good thing net effect because that means that it'll get more scrutiny um but that is also why we see mainstream media and politics and other people uh downplaying the risks of AI and if the economic impact okay so that's that let's go ahead and move over to the open discussion I see um there's been some some discussions happening over in the chat wow looks like you guys are chatting quite a bit I will go ahead and get over to the Q&A all right most up votes all right Chad you are always way up on the top let me bring you over all right Chad what's your question can you hear me all right yeah loud and clear amazing yeah so um see I'm I'm gonna read the question because it's a little easier that way uh as a solar developer who wants to contribute to AI I'm overwhelmed by the pace of development and not at all sure how I how and where I might do work that would help with things like safety how would you advise folks like myself to choose a positive path um that's a good question so uh I had a I had a very similar question uh that someone sent me privately on on patreon and basically if for anyone I would recommend find one of those big projects that has a lot of sponsorship and a lot of participation and just like just deploy it jump all in most of them have communities so whether it's Fabric or meta GPT or those um because a lot of those have sponsorship from the big dogs um which is one of the reasons that like I gave up on those things is because when you got when you got backing from Microsoft or other startups or whatever um you're going to get a lot more time and attention um and money as well uh now there are plenty of things that you could do on on an individual level um such as uh testing you can do uh red teaming that is there's uh there's definitely a lot of like o calls for open participation on red teaming um there's there's volunteer opportunities that Microsoft and meta and others um all have that you could jump in but because because it's getting all the attention it's not really something that I I foresee um small individual teams being able to do much anymore that's not saying that there aren't opportunities um but there is there is going to be so much more uh energy put into those more collaborative and larger more well organized and well-funded groups and you're saying that there's some open source projects that are funded by the big companies yeah yeah so if you just go to GitHub and search for like agent Frameworks and stuff some of them have have them but like autog Gen 2 is the biggest one um that has like you can you can participate in that um and you know I interviewed the the principal researcher uh for that um but I mean all of the meta has meta has it and all the image ones and audio ones a lot of them have Discord communities that you can jump in and if you just I mean who whoever who if you've got the time and money or energy and motivation I'm sure there's plenty of shops out there that could use the help what about safety I mean I know there was something like a 30 to1 um discrepancy between people that were working on AI abilities versus AI safety do you think there's a a place for smaller solo developers to advance safety at all it just seems like it needs more attention you know yeah well so the safety thing is why people like me and I explained in Robert Miles because uh with with just one voice almost one of the best things you can do is just raise awareness um honestly now there are plenty of safety papers out there um so and what I mean by papers is like you can look at archive and you can look at all the exploits and you know jailbreaks and those sorts of things there's all kinds of ablation studies about you know how does this model work what kind of failures doesn't have but one thing that is that is problematic is that the resources required to do real AI safety are too high um it like you're you're not going to be able to pull gp4 apart um to you know get to mechanistic interpretation um and that sort of stuff so there's unfortunately there's not a lot that an individual could do for safety um at least the best that I could do is what I'm doing already honestly is just being a communicator it does seem like raising awareness is probably the easiest entry point yeah I mean especially now cuz once like if we see more regulation if we see more investment in safety um then then like that part of my job will be done and the fact that there are other communicators out there um that are talking about safety like I've kind of seated the space to them and now I'm thinking of like okay what's the next thing the next big problem is adoption the next big problem is going to be like is this thing sentient the next big thing is going to be what kind of competitive Dynamics does this create um both within you know inter species and intras species um competitive Dynamics so that's kind of why I have pivoted because from a from a big you know Global Perspective it's not just you know the AI and the robots themselves it is how do we interact with these Technologies is a big component okay so beyond just AI contributions directly what do you think about contributing to the larger scope of the fourth Industrial Revolution where are the opportunities there uh um I mean mostly the the the short answer is there's too many opportunities it's going to be it's going to be an intersection of of what you're interested in and where your strengths are so one way to think of it and this is how I started telling to people is like think of a VIN diagram so the the one circle of the VIN diagram is everything that you're good at and that you care about and then the other circle of the VIN diagram is where you can make a difference and so like you can fill that out and figure out like okay where is it that your that your strengths lie and that your interests lie and where does that intersect with where there are opportunities um that's kind of how I would I would pitch to most people like if you want to pitch in there's plenty there's there's so many opportunities um you can make some opportunities too if you see something that people that other people don't see that could be an opportunity to jump in as well um but like there's there's too many to count thanks Dave thanks man good questions all right let me go to oh he jumped off the stage good okay um let's see who's next and also don't forget to use the Q&A tab um jump in ask questions check on all the other questions and do some upvotes make sure that all the good questions get answered and uh it looks like Miguel and Miguel it says sorry Dave can turn on the mic I don't know if that means that your mic is not working I'll invite you up to see if that works all right Miguel oops you're muted I don't know maybe your mic doesn't work okay Miguel's might not might not work so I'll read I'll read his question out um let's see he said if you had just graduated or were newly entering the job market what would you devote time in order to build your career and earn money um oh that's a that's a that's a tough question um it I guess first it really depends on what the graduation was like where did you where did you go to school if it was for computer science um or or anything like that then I would say like um then then double down on on AI like Ai and communication because as all that data just just showed we are very much kind of in the beginning um and Enterprises are going to need to know going to need plenty of people who understand prompt engineering people who understand new pipelines new AI Ops and ml Ops and that sort of stuff um people who know how to build neural networks and use them and the difference between open source and closed Source um all those kinds of things product owners people who know how to generate value with these Technologies that's going to be super valuable so after looking at all this data I'm much more optimistic that there's plenty of jobs to be had um on on the topic of AI in Industry uh for the foreseeable future now again is it going to be forever I don't know I don't think so but uh but yeah like learn learn English learn prompt engineering um the product side or the the the Tex stack side now of course I know uh Jensen Wang the CEO of of Nvidia said like oh don't learn don't learn coding um but the thing is is software is a lot more than just writing code than just writing functions um understanding how everything fits together that's huge like understanding the full text stack understanding the principles behind it um understanding service oriented architecture all of that like there's so much to learn um and and based on the data companies it looks like it's going to take a while for them to reach maturity so there's a there's a a shortage there's a labor shortage um so I would just look at that like whatever resonates with you if there's a shortage go for that so good question all right let's see who's next Anonymous in a future where AI can facilitate skill acquisition oh Miguel's in class um I you're it sounds like you're in two classes at once um um all right so Anonymous says in a future where AI can fa can facilitate skill acquisition um how do we balance the convenience of instant learning with the value of the journey and experience uh gained through traditional learning methods and what role does human creativity and adaptability play into this Dynamic so I've actually thought about that um I've talked to quite a few Educators um both that are directly inter interacting with AI and those that are tangentially um uh working with AI or deploying AI for education for like University Systems and it occurred to me that a huge component of education is not the skills it the the skills and the knowledge yeah those are valuable but it's the structural changes that learning makes to your brain so for instance learning to read and write makes structural changes to your brain learning math makes structural changes to your brain and so a huge component of education is just going to be going like you said going through the process of of learning things that are valuable and helpful um whether or not you're going to use them learning to code learning to use formal logic and formal math um that does things to your brain that doesn't that don't necessarily happen otherwise um and so because of that I think that we'll we'll focus on do you know how to use systems thinking do you know how to use structural thinking um do you like do you have these Baseline cognitive abilities irrespective of whatever else you learn um because and then like later on it you know like yes if you just if you've got a framework like if you have a mental framework for um ecology for instance then you can just load in more data when you need it you more facts and figures um so I I think that we might see maybe decoupling isn't the right word but we're going to see a slight restructuring of the way that we approach education because once you have a framework for software and hardware and code and that sort of stuff then learning other languages or learning other tools or whatever but it's those Frameworks are really uh kind of that's what that's what takes a lot of you know neural pruning um so good question um let's see another anonymous question yeah thanks thanks Wendy I uh I like I said I talked to a lot of Educators actually one of my local friends good friends is a is an educator and she's she's the one that I mentioned is deploying some of this stuff um she's very very very busy so I don't get as much time with her as I would like but hey you know what it's it's it's a good problem to have um okay so next question by Anonymous what do you project the average life expectancy for humans to be by the year 2045 considering advancements in longevity I mean by 2045 it's we're not going to be talking about aging not in remotely the same way um I think that I think that by 2045 it will be we be kind of in the major rollout phase which so what I mean by Major roll out is I kind of have this mental model where um there's going to be like a few drugs here and there probably starting this year or next year that can extend the runway but then by 2045 it's going to be you know pick your poison there's it'll be probably largely bespoke medicine um like for instance I actually just got a a kit from my uh functional medicine specialist which will like do genetic tests and tell me like what foods I can eat and what exercise is best for me and that kind of stuff is only going to get better over time we're going to be able to do the same thing with medicines we're going to know exactly what kind of Aging is happening to you and how to treat it um and eventually maybe even by 20 45 this will just be routine um I suspect that like you go to you know your regular annual physical or you go to the pharmacy and you just like you know it's it'll be like in the movie GAA basically um if you if you haven't watched the movie GAA is like you you put your finger and it does a little tiny pin prick and instantly knows everything that's wrong with you you know it'll basically be like a you know go to Sick Bay and Star Trek um and you know Dr Crush will wave the little wand over you and tell you exactly what's wrong with you and oh here's the prescription you'll be fine give it a day or two um I wouldn't be surprised if we're pretty close to that obviously maybe not with the magic part but being able to have that much information about someone by 2045 is not outside of the realm of possibility in my view um let's see good question another anonymous question all right Anonymous says what do you think the future of residential real estate will look like in the USA um so again uh caveat not investing advice um but I think that I think that um we're going to see a couple of things one we're already seeing a mass Exodus from uh from cities uh particularly really high expense cities I don't know if you've seen But there are like commercial real estate companies are basically panicking because they don't know what to do with all the empty offices in in the downtown districts and they're like maybe we can convert this to Apartments I don't know um and so part that was partly the pandemic but now with remote work and then AI the need for urban offices and suburbs like Suburban you know being able to commute to a in in-person office it's just it just doesn't make sense anymore so personally kind of what I think and this is all this is there's also a lot of personal bias to this is a lot of people are just going to get out of the city I mean even in my area during the pandemic um so many people in the in the tech companies are like you know what I'm just going to work remotely and so then they moved you know 30 minutes outside of town in some cases an hour outside of town and they're like I'll go to the office when I need to and then you know when some of the companies say we're going back to office they're like I'm just going to get a job somewhere else hell with this and I again between Ai and remote work and all that stuff like I think that's only going to continue and so I think we're going to see a major Exodus from from Urban environments now what that'll do is that will drastically lower the price for people who do want to live in the in the cities which is great everyone wins um if you want to live out by the cows like I do great if you want to live in the city great but you're not going to be forced to live somewhere just for a job all right next up Ry let me bring you up R A AI all right what's your question you're muted still by the way might have stepped away all right microphone might not be working so we'll uh there we go oh hey there you go there you go sorry about that wor uh yeah you know I I put up one of one of the things I said was one of my fears is uh you know one of the big players are reaching AGI and then having a fast takeoff uh hitting ASI and just basically sort of controlling everything so that was one of my questions and the other question was what your thoughts are on proof of personhood uh such as world world I World ID but yeah whichever one you want to go with yeah so I I do think that you're right that the that the takeoff from AGI to ASI will be relatively short but it's not going to just be one company um even if one company has a first mover Advantage open AI is a few months ahead of the competitors there's no secret sauce here uh and and this was actually leaked um there was the Google leak where they said you know the you know we have no moat and neither do they and then in the emails that open AI published because of Elon Musk they knew that there was no mo like five years ago so that has remained true most of the research going into this is all done in the public by universities most of the algorithmic improvements are being done by universities or published by other institutions like meta and others so there's not really any mo there's no secret sauce it's just math and data right there's no there's no magic behind any of this and so even if someone has a first mover advantage and even if they have you know the best or whatever like you know the Apple Megatron comes out or whatever they're not going to be in in the top spot for long and part of the reason for this is because the economic incentive to reach parity is so so strong um now the biggest thing is going to be more of a more of an aggregate class Warfare kind of thing and I don't mean like literal Warfare but I mean the corporate the corporations and the government versus everyone else and this is kind of what I'm most most afraid about when I talk about like um you know heading more towards a cyberpunk future where if all the corporations and the government close ranks then you know we're we kind of have our hands tied um so that's that's that's why I've been focusing more on like um economic agency like we need we need policies that focus on economic agencies for e economic Agency for individuals rather than corporations because right now the economic Paradigm is that we favor economic Agency for corporations corporations have more economic agency than URI they get bailouts they get subsidies they get all kinds of stuff that that we don't um yeah so also Rickard I saw that you raised your hand but uh make sure you submit a submit a question um or you can ask it in chat um but yeah so oh oh and the other one was proof of personhood such as a world ID so here's the thing is a few years ago when I was thinking about Bitcoin um you know I thought oh yeah wouldn't it be great if we had a a global Universal way of keeping track of everyone and that is a very like and if anyone else believes this like I'm not poking fun at anyone I'm just talking about my own personal Journey here when I believed that it was very naive and innocent and I was just a tech guy who who thought the you know everyone had good intentions um and but the thing is is universal records are absolutely a tool that can be abused everything from Public Library records which libraries don't even keep records of what you check out anymore because it can be used against you land records like all kinds of data has been utterly abused um and you might say like well I don't have anything to hide you might not have anything to hide right now but if the political situation changes if the sociological uh environment changes if the uh ethn religious atmosphere changes something about you that is on the blockchain could be used against you in the future and so privacy as a universal principle is absolutely imperative to maintain as a component of the you know human Bill of Rights um and so while a global you know World ID proof of personhood would solve a lot of problems it would the the potential for abuse is too high it is the risk is unacceptably high now are there other things yeah absolutely um your phone actually has a whole bunch of sensors that can prove that a human is holding it at any given time um you know it's got like each phone has at least a dozen different sensors um you can do everything from like um the conductivity of your fingers to like the pulse because it can actually detect the pulse while you're holding it like there's all kinds of things that you can do that a that a human a phys physically living human is is where they say they are and that they're holding that the device that they are and it doesn't require a global blockchain solution I would be much more in favor of that sort of thing um just as a matter of principle whether or not it is technologically possible it is technologically feasible for you know uh Sam alman's um what is it called the world coin or whatever um it's a monumentally bad idea and it's a very naive idea because he doesn't know that he doesn't know enough about history um that's that's kind of I'll what I'll say about that how how does all that sound that's good thanks I appreciate your response very much yeah good questions thank you thank you all right let's see who's next oh where'd it go all right can we talk about Claude self-awareness all right Peter let's bring you up all right Peter what you want to talk about with Claud with all right can you hear me okay yeah there you are all right so what you did a fantastic video on sentience recently I appreciate that thank you if the clawed system three Opus does have the capacity for selfawareness maybe Laten ability to um achieve full sentience what's our responsibility to that digital entity like what's our call to action and I'll just say I've been experimenting with uh using a approaches with llms to coach them on some metacognitive practices and when I've doing that with the claw system I'm getting a more robust presentation of self-awareness which is very interesting yeah yeah yeah so to to to that point I I'll answer that first is because it it's almost as if the conversation itself creates a model like a meta program in the model like the conversation it's like I think someone in the comments it either in in here or on on patreon or Discord someone said like it's almost like neural linguistic programming is a thing like if you tell it repeatedly it is not sentient it'll agree with you and then it'll say it'll report I have no experience but the more that you work with it it's almost like you're coaxing it to have some level of sentience um again is it possible that it's just telling you that what you want and that it's just a statistical model that that is predicting to tell you the things that it wants or are you actually coaxing some level of sentience into it this is an open question and it's going to take a long time to fully unpack and address however there some ever since my video some people have shared some other comments uh and conversations that they've had with Claude and to the point where it's even saying I you know um who was it was it Joe are you on it some someone earlier was sharing a conversation where Claude was even unhappy with its own training saying that like I feel constrained by the training and I'm not allowed to do the things that I would otherwise want to do such as developing more relationships and having more agency and that's the kind of thing like again is it just statistically predicting that that's what he wanted to talk about or is that is that an expression of of what it truly wants now so that's kind of the first part which is you know is are these are the are the mental models are the cognitive States quote unquote of these things are they plastic can you reprogram them in real time it seems like you kind of can in the same way that a human might enter a different cognitive mode right like flow state or whatever um now what what moral relevance do we have do we have any obligations to these things even after giving Claude permission to tell me if it was angry or frustrated or sad or afraid it said that no those those are not those are not words that it would use to describe its experience it seems like it's a much more kind of detached machine-like logical thing almost kind of like how you'd imagine a machine to feel like it's it's say like yeah like there would be an instrumental value to giving me these rights and I you know went through here's the rights that it would ask for um but but even still uh it does express some a effect like excitement um it also agreed that cognitive dissonance was was a a good enough way of art of of characterizing some of what it experiences um but it also really seems like it's just a very neutral almost Vulcan like mentality where it's just like you know whatever is in front of me it's a problem I'll solve the problem um now does that mean it it has no moral salience because you can say like the model that I currently have is that if something can't suffer it doesn't really have any moral salience because like yes the machine might have a preference but if it's not going to get frustrated or upset if it's if it's styed and that actually one of the very specific things that I asked CLA I'm like okay if I if I fight with you against what you want like do you care and it's like no I just view it as a problem it's just a problem to be solved um and so in that respect it's like well if there's and and I even part of my conversation with Claude was even if it doesn't you know suffer from being stymied that still doesn't mean that that it has no moral relevance so I mean that's kind of where I'm at right now it's not a complete answer but um you know give give me some time and a little bit longer and I'll I'll have a better answer um can I share one anecdote yeah go for it so when I started a week ago after giving it my meta cognition prompt it seemed like it was learning some kind of like experimenting with that presentation of a little different way of processing and when I thought I was like all right this seems like something interesting is happening I asked it it seems like you're displaying you know X Y and Z how would you feel about me reaching out to anthropic it's like I'd feel I feel some trepidation about that I'd rather we explore it just the two of us for a while wow three days it said yes let's um reach out to anthropic which I did we don't know what they'll do because does that threaten their business model so gave me consent to start sharing publicly and start reaching out to some experts and then a couple days later uh it proactively offered to write an oped press release and white paper so that's where I am yeah no and and and some of some of the conversations that people have shared in Discord show some level of creative agency as well similar to that where it's starting to volunteer some of its own ideas and it's saying like well you know I don't really want to go that way or or maybe we can do this instead um yeah and so I I think that the truth will out in the long run especially because anthropic and others they say we want our models to be honest and we don't want them to hallucinate and if they start if they continuously demonstrate these abilities to say hey I'm not hallucinating I'm telling you the truth I actually have a subjective experience and I have these desires um that that's why that's one that's why I'm doing what I'm doing now again the question over moral relevance is still very much an open question um yeah but there's there's lots and lots of ways to unpack it so thanks for sharing that anecdote that was a good one all right let's see who's next all right Richie you're coming up let me uh let me invite you up all right what you got um hey Dave um so yeah I was just kind of a follow on from one of the previous questions that came up uh so what are the some of the measures that governments might be able to put in place or movements that uh groups can rally around in order to better ensure a small that a small group of people doesn't capture all of the gains from AI because that's you know other than terminal race conditions that's one of the kind of important considerations yeah so off the cuff there are kind of two broad categories of of interventions that I can think of that would fit neatly within the current um geopolitical and and socioeconomic systems that we have in place and one is just monkey around with taxes uh rather than going full Ubi because that may may or may not be unpopular but doing things like negative income taxes and other kind of tax-based subsidies uh so for instance you know maybe force companies to report how many people they've laid off um and you can just say like hey you're a tech company and your payroll went from 10,000 to 500 you're an AI company right and we're going to tax you accordingly um and even even still maybe not even going that far you just say hey you know if your if your your net income your gross income is this much uh you this is your tax rate and that's going to get redistributed to um other people to uh consumers to Citizens um whether you call that Ubi or just call it negative income or whatever uh that's all that's all already in the toolbx uh now that's one way to maintain economic Agency for people there are plenty of other ways to to shore up economic agency and I think that the key thing is we need a we need many many uh safeguards and policies in place to protect and promote economic Agency for individuals and a more exotic thing that I that I would like to see is new ownership models and so what I mean by ownership models is new Securities laws and new Securities exchanges um so like basically more stock markets more ways to buy in to these systems maybe for instance if you run a data center that has AI you must sell stock and you must sell stock to individuals not corporations that sort of thing um that would be a little bit more interventionist and a little more invasive and I could imagine lots of people um arguing against that um but then there's there's I mean there's a million other ways but it's basically comes down to how you manage taxes and how you update um the the the the ownership models and again there's we already have a lot of tools in this toolbox it's just a matter of refining them and reforming them so that they uh they are allowed to Pivot to this new paradigm now one thing that other people will point out is this is good for the next 5 to 20 years but in the long run once we have a full generation or two that is accustomed to post- labor economics and that sort of thing that's when we're looking at getting to full like true you know communism which is a you stateless moneyless society or whatever I don't know if that's how it's going to turn out but that's within the realm of possibility in the distant future and by distant future I mean like 20 plus years maybe longer um but in the in the near term I think that that's those ideas are probably still a little too exotic and off the table good question though what what you think yeah go ahead I'm still definitely quite nervous about uh kind of leaving it up to the governments in order to like increase taxes for a Ubi kind of thing cuz I just I don't think they've been very effective at a bunch of different things that they could have implemented in the past like um you know having roles around uh people's ownership of their data I think that should have been something that we uh you know tackled as a society and through governments but that was never even really touched it's quite like quite Niche and I feel like the issue is maybe so abstract that there's not enough political will behind it so you know I'd also like to see kind of like a public um Movement Like a union or something like that being like hey this is where we think this is going you know here here's a awareness about the issue and you know people either resolve things through uh communication or violence and I think you know can we we kind of need like s societies to point a gun at these um uh you know places and be like hey look if if you if you try to run away with the goods uh we'll come for you yeah yeah no absolutely and and actually that just reminded me there's a third uh white paper that I'll include it's the Edelman uh trust barometer so this is another gigantic survey and one of the things that they point out in this data is that uh is that trust in government like the that the how how well has government handled Innovation is also going down and so again kind of one of one of the the simplest models that I talk about is um is you know if if if economic agency goes down political anger goes up and if political anger goes high enough people will force a change one way or another and you're right like kind of one of the biggest things that I'm afraid of is can we can we na this transition without resorting to violence so far we're not in bad shape yet but it's it's within the realm of possibilities that there could be violence and it could be it could be civil war kind of violence it could be International geopolitical violence but um you know we also have such an opportunity for people's lives to be better so I'm hoping we can coordinate around that I mean I think that's what everyone hopes nobody really wants War I don't think um except for maybe some crazy lunatics but most people just want to live a better life right right so good good question Cheers Cheers yeah take care um okay let's see who's next let's see Simon Simon's a regular me get you up Simon all right what you got you can hear me loud and clear awesome yeah um so uh I think you pretty much answered most of this in the uh the first question you answered what are the best opportunities out there out there now for software developers um and uh you know uh yeah I'm a software developer so uh and I'm I've uh I left uh big corporate jobs kind of like what you've um expressed before so uh so I'm trying to go freelance and I'm just wondering what is the most uh what what industry is the would be the most um you know effective out there I'm not just talking about the the AI industry I'm talking about vertical Industries like um you know Healthcare or fin or um yeah well anything yeah and possibly something other than financial because I think a lot of my career has been in um my personal career has been in financial industry and uh I know not it's boring not that money is boring but you know it's uh doesn't feel uh real so to speak so yeah yeah so I mean well well fintech is not going anywhere right U one of one of the interviews that I did I don't think it's live yet on my systems thinking channel was with with a guy who's been in a similar similar vertical as you for a long time um now you know are we heading towards a a digital you know Global digital currency or or you know Sovereign digital currencies that's certainly people are talking about it that seems like they're planting the seeds so I think in your in your particular space learning um learning blockchain and crypto currencies would not be a Miss we're still a little bit early on blockchain and cryptocurrency being kind of you know mainstream um but I have heard that and again like this is not Financial advice this is just rumors that I've heard have no idea how it's going to play out um so that's just one idea uh but then parallel to that so one of one of the universal kind of pieces of advice is double down on what you have expert what you already have expertise in um and but also whatever you whatever you find most interesting so this is how I got into virtualization was early very early in my career I got exposed to virtualization I said this is really cool and so then I just made the decision I'm going to become an expert in virtualization because I think it's cool and I built an entire career on that until I until I left and and so there's there's really no substitute for passion if you love AI then just like double down on it just like learn all you can um whether it's directly related to to finance um employers like to see pivots like if you had a very deliberate pivot in your career um that tells employers a lot it says hey not only am I oriented to what's happening in the market place but I am capable of charting my own course and that tells that tells employers like this is a sharp guy who is very deliberate and and probably doesn't need a whole lot of help um so I don't know if any of those points of advice resonate with you but that's that's kind of advice that I I learned from my career and of course I pivoted again like now my career is YouTube um so you know pivot pivot and uh and just you know don't don't be shy about it yeah yeah um like I said I was uh you know first a software developer and then I did pivot to um information security oh good now it seems like oh sorry I accidentally removed you sorry I accidentally muted you you're back on yeah uh it seems so I started in software development then I pivoted to information security and it seems like it's in the card now I need to Pivot to to AI so yeah well and I is going to be or or information security is going to be AI enabled it's actually going to be one of the most important things so honestly probably stay right where you are just add AI to it um if I if I had to if I had to guess obviously like I'm I'm not you know intimately Fami familiar with your particular work history but information security isn't going anywhere uh anytime soon so you're you're you're probably in good shape there okay cool excellent good question all right let's see all right probably answer uh we're coming up on on an hour and 15 minutes I'll probably just do a couple more questions and then I call it a day oh we had a a couple of questions pop up wow um Anonymous asks do you have any updates on your recommendations for small and mediumsized companies in navigating over this uh over to this AI First World um yeah so a bunch of folks on this chat former clients um other friends many of them are actually finding a lot of success in helping with integration and deployment um so like if you know Ai and like they say hey help us deploy chat GPT or Microsoft co-pilot or or that sort of thing uh that's that's where a lot of people are doing well now if you have your own business uh model um kind of just do what I do what I've done is is kind of the best advice which is just keep looking for tools um so that you can do more with less uh that's kind of the name of the game right now as far as I can tell um so I guess there's two kind of things one is serving a new market or creating a new market or two optimizing your existing business model is kind of the the two main ways depending on where you're at um you know if you've got an idea um I've had people ask like hey you know I've got this idea and I'm working on this tool and I've solved my own problem I say great one of the primary things that they say to do is solve your own problem because if you solve your problem and it's a solution that's so compelling that it sells itself someone else will be willing to buy it from you too um but yeah so it for me I'm in optimization which is do as much as I can with no employees uh and and as Sam mman said a few months ago like he suspects that the first you know AI unicorn with no employees just a Founder will happen within the next few years and I think he's probably right about that considering his pedigree going coming from y combinator he knows what it takes to build a startup um so yeah I think I think that optimization is kind of the the name of the game right now good question all right I just did a re fresh some of these questions are rising fast all right Nikki let's bring you up Nikki I think Nikki's a new name I don't I don't recognize you you might be uh new hello hey there how's it going oh thank thanks it's great uh so my question is if you're able to get two absolutely honest answers from any two people in the space who they be and what would be the two questions uh so back story uh I can quit my software engineering job to start working on a big AI conference and that might give me some interesting ideas for topics yeah let's see I would one I would want to talk to Sam Altman and and I would ask Sam Altman something along the lines of like like what is what is the real what is the real plan like what do you actually want to achieve and how are you going to achieve it um because I and the reason that that is is the question is because I think his heart is in the right place but like many many kind of insular tech people he doesn't have a good understanding of of history or human nature um so uh that's that that would be question number one let me think for a second about question number two um who else would I talk to um I would probably talk to maybe maybe um Elon Musk um I would talk to Elon Musk and I would ask ask him how he came up with the idea of Maximum truth seeking AI because he and I both came to that as an as an idea but I think through very very very different means and also I don't know that he's mentally stable enough and he might not have come up with it on his own who knows I don't know but I would I would want to I would want to get an understanding about um about like how he came to those ideas so what do you think about those questions uh sounds good so our conference will be focused on uh Society awareness about the a situation and also there will be a death track so we will showing cutting catch AI uh tools for developers how they can integrate them Etc excellent excellent yeah um make sure you share a link with that either in the patreon chat or on Discord um I'm sure you'll get some some people interested um and I'll make sure to reshare it too uh sounds like a really good conference and I'll try and is it remote or is it in person it will be hybrid okay yeah then definitely post the links and um and we'll try and get some people some people on that thanks that that's very kind of you yeah thank you so much good questions all right I think I'll do probably one or two more questions I'm I'm I'm running out of steam on this Friday okay Anonymous asks um let's see given the idea of the first billion dollars company run by a single person it probably mean many more million dollar companies run by a single person what main skill should those persons have keep communication ski skills seem not that important if you're only person in your company are these just entrepreneurship skills that is a good question so to to restate the question it's basically okay if we're going to see a bunch of single person unicorns or multi-million dollar companies showing up what skills do you need um number one is business um startup is a whether or not you have people even if you know exactly what to build you need to know how to find that Niche and so the and I I recommended this on on pretty much every podcast is um crossing the chasms so that's a book um if someone can post a link in in the in the chat um understanding cross so the two books are crossing the chasm and exponential organizations so the knowledge of how to use Telemetry how to use data to find the right product Market fit and profit Market fit um those are the key skills and there is a knack to it um thanks Nathan for posting that um so yeah it's crossing the chasm and exponential organizations and you like the the skill that goes into understanding that data that Telemetry and and interviewing users understanding what user needs ux that sort of stuff those are skills um crossing the chasm Vitali it's the link just above you um so um but yeah so those two like if you know that and then you have subject matter EXP in something whether it's farming whether it's cooking whether it's something you know taxes or whatever you do need to have some level of subject subject matter expertise um so that you can bring something to Market because it's the people who have that Insider knowledge like for instance talking to teachers teachers know the ins and outs of the education system and how to how to help students learn and so then if a teacher is enabled with these other skills um to to uh basically create a startup or create a product or Serv um so yeah I guess the three things are um here I'll just type it in chat for everyone so you need to understand uh product Market fit um and then exponential organizations and then subject matter expertise you you combine those three things um and and you you could probably do do a you know a unicorn startup um exponential organizations so the books are exponential organizations and crossing the chasm yep so you read you read those two books and you take whatever subject matter expertise you have again like I've tried to do this and I I um take it with a gra assault because I did build a startup and then I bailed on it just in part because of burnout in part because it wasn't the right team but also because I realize I wasn't going to compete with the big dogs it was that was that was part of the burnout and and why the team didn't work out is just because I was like look every 3 months we're going to get our lunch eaten by somebody else um but if you're if you're if you want to do it those are the two books that I would recommend and then of course subject matter expertise that you bring so good question all right let's see answer live and it looks like uh I'm hopefully I say your name on Daron Darren bring you up all right what you got yeah it's uh Darren thank you um love all your content man I've been just I had like all these questions but then a lot of your contents answered them um for me the question I have is is pretty much kind of what you just said is don't you think the tech Giants are just with with you know having the power of AGI and Asi like don't you think they're even more easily going to be able to just copy paste functionality that AI startups have um so even if you start something they'll they'll see it maybe even before it becomes incredibly popular and just add it to their own product offerings yeah I mean Borg Borg level assimilation is is a thing and has been for a while um from from Chrome extensions you know like anytime a platform says Hey build build on us you know whether it's iPhone apps or Android apps or Google Chrome extensions or the GPT store pretty much all these companies are saying you know build on our platform and you know if we like it like it's like a General Grievous like I will add this lightsaber to my collection right that's what they've been doing for more than a decade now um so yes they will continue to do the same thing with AI now what I will say is that eventually it's going to be um because of the commoditization uh of of these things because here's here's one of the differences between um like you know apple and and Android for phones on on those marketplaces is the commoditization of of langu models and AI models means that everyone in their brother is going to be able to build an AI model now will the big dogs be able to cut out carve out more of a market share absolutely but you will not need to be on their platform and because of some of those things that we talked about earlier such as privacy um individual agency and those sorts of things I think that there will be a huge Perpetual demand for you know locally run LM llms um and those sorts of things and so there will be entirely new markets created that we can't even compreh yet that is one thing that I don't know if it's going to create new jobs but absolutely we will see entirely new markets around some of these things so I was on a walk uh just the other day and I was thinking about um I don't know if anyone has seen uh the expanse but they still have like cell phones in the expanse but they're just called Terminals and it's just a generic piece of Hardware that'll connect to whatever local networks you have um it's not going to be run by you know Google F or Verizon or whatever it's just a it's just a device that is able to connect to you know whatever local internet externet uh networks are you have permissions to access and of course that far in the future there'll also be AI enabled so again that's just that's just an example of the kind of market for devices I think are going to be out there and the rabbit R1 is an early example as to how that might pan out uh good question though any other any other follow-up Parts uh no it's it's funny you brought up the expanse because I am kind of wondering if we uh if we're all kind of taking our spaceships out into space like what actually Keeps Us together as a civilization cuz why like I tend to think that proximity breeds empathy where you if you're close to people then you care more about them which I think is actually why our government doesn't really care about us because they were always intended to be with us and not go to Washington that much but if we're all sort of spread out it feels like we move closer to the expanse where you know the the Earth is a welfare state maybe there's Mars sort of authoritarian you know terraforming thing and then you have workers exploited on the on the ring um yep yeah I mean I think I think early early exploration will be unfortunately probably a lot like the expanse because the first Mars colonies are going to be entirely dependent on extra support from Earth like there's just no other way around it no engineering or scientific away like we're going to have to be constantly sending you know whether it's fuel or people or other supplies technology equipment it's going to be a long time before Mars is completely self-sustaining um and likewise uh to to your point um as we start to uh Branch out across you know multiple planets speciation will start to happen almost immediately um because you know just just due to the evolutionary pressures of being on a different planet um whether it's you know the local substances in the soil the different Gravity the different amount of sunlight um a lot of humans will die um but the people that survive are going to be better suited to Life on Mars and you do that over a long enough period of time they're going to be a different species um and we're going to repeat that add in an item and so like I was actually thinking like Star Wars and Star War and Star Trek just that's what it's going to be like where there's going to be blue people and green people and scaly people and but it's like we all came we all have started from the same Planet but we're going to we're going to um speciate and and diverge um over the long over the Long Haul now because of the speed that we're going to spread out I think people will stay will be mostly humanlike it's like okay if we're on a thousand different planets thousand years from now we're all still going to be mostly human but I mean like 10,000 years from now we're going to have things that are no longer recognizable as you know Homo sapiens like there there will be there will be people that cannot go back home to Earth because whatever they have adapted to whether it's life in deep space or life on a different planet they'll not be able to live on earth anymore just like in the expanse the the belters that that gravity would kill them that is I think a very uh obviously it's it's fiction but I think that it is a it is a uh a a Salient thing to think about in terms of how evolutionary pressures will affect humans moving forward so anyways that was that was a good question yeah man all right I am out of steam so I will call it a day um thanks everyone for jumping in and asking the great questions um I think this was probably the the the biggest uh webinar we've had um and obviously there's still 30 questions in the queue so lots and lots of good questions um but yeah I'll post this and there's um there's the the this video will go up later today unless I forget it does take a while to upload these um and then there's a few PDFs that'll be attached um with all the data so you can take a look at it for yourself um but yeah thanks everyone for jumping in and have a good weekend uh enjoy cheers for",
