  "transcript": "it's been quite a while since I updated my current home lab setup and oh boy there has been a lot of changes even down to the dashboard here I used to use Heimdall and this is Homer just one of the many changes or additions now in this video what we're going to be doing is an overview of all the services running on my home lab and briefly talk about how just everything is set up now unlike a lot of other videos I'm not going to bore you by talking about my firewall and database setup for the next 15 minutes instead most things that you're going to see in this video can be easily spun up just with a Docker container as most things on my network are simply that easy to understand kind of front-facing applications that most people in my household have access to and use on a daily basis now this video is sponsored by private internet access I'm going to talk about that a little bit more when I get to these uh download clients here now starting off with the dashboard this is the first thing you're seeing and it is beautiful this is homar one of the reasons why I went with this other than obviously the appearance is the integration with the r Suite of applications which you can see right here for example right here this is a calendar it's actually going to tell me when there's going to be new episodes released that links up to sonar so we can see what I have in my media server and let me know when things change we have a current download speed this links up to those download clients you can see this is my torrent client kind of integrated into here so I could see what is going on scrolling back up this is linked up to overseer so I can see all the requests on my server this is linked up to both jellyfin and Plex so I can see what is being streamed from my home server and overall customation is really nice for a while there I was using the container called home page which is also pretty but that is configured with text documents or text files this you can enter edit mode and from here you can go ahead change manipulate move move things around click on a application edit and then have access to everything you need save that exit save changes it's really easy to mess with and configure this it also supports Docker integration so if I click on Docker you can see all the containers this can read all the containers that are running on the same instance or the same server that this is running on so you can see a lot of the services right here it is missing some which I'll talk about a little bit later but we can see the ports we can see its current state the image and a lot more in here you can actually kind of manage it start stop remove and add it to Homer through here if you would like to additionally there are some additional settings so if I go over here go to settings we can change the default search we could download the config if we have some customizations here for the layout grid stack all the way down to appearance in which you can change here including custom CSS which is very nice additionally they do have a light mode which frankly I would not recommend and that right there is what's going to go on in this video I'm going to be going over all of these applications giving you a very brief rundown of what it is and how I use it and if you are interested leave a comment down below and I might make a full video on something that I'm going to cover if you guys are interested now one thing to understand about my home network which will kind of help you understand how everything's set up is I have three primary devices I have a Synology Nas which we're going to talk about at the end we have an unraid server which is running on a um I think it's a Terra Master Nas and then we have just a standard Ubuntu install with protainer running independently on an Intel Nook now we're going to start with the Intel Nook because that is what is running Plex at the moment if I go to protainer right here let's zoom in just a bit and let's live connect to this instance you can see this has 16 different containers definitely not as pretty of a setup but this is running Plex protein there which we're currently in Watchtower which is a really nice Docker application that will automatically kind of scan pull and update your containers for you really nice I will be making a dedicated video on that so do make sure you subscribe ring that Bell we have both Tesla mate and Kazam which we're going to be diving into but first Plex Plex right here this is my main media server and there's a lot of reasons for it I did a whole separate video kind of going over my reasonings primarily Plex just works a little bit better when it comes to sharing externally and now that it works better it works easier for people who aren't experienced with like IP addresses and all that I could add my grandma directly to my kind of home share for example she logs into Plex on all my stuff automatically just shows up pretty cool overall Plex works great I like the features I never use kind of the music or their specific live stream stuff which you can find down here never use any of that this is all my media right here if we go to activity for example dashboard we could see we do have the voice streaming from an Apple TV that's another reason why I kind of prefer Plex now of course you probably saw jellyfin right here now I run both and they're just connected it's pretty easy to the exact same library to the exact same server and jellyfit is more of a backup service because there are definitely constiplex and that is if you're trying to stream stuff offline Plex doesn't like that it gets kind of weird this is very helpful if for some reason I'm having network issues I have Century Link here so it's going to happen jelly pin works great again I use this if I'm having network issues and another reason I kind of like Plex is it's just a bigger application there's a lot more third-party tools and services and this right here the Thule is one of them so gonna sign in with Plex real quick and here we go we get a whole bunch of additional data and statistics about my specific Plex server we have play counts here Better Call Saul is super popular on my server we have bones my Grandma's watching of Roseanne I've been watching the handmaid's tale and we have a lot more data and if we go into graphs we can see a lot of that here we can see the play count by media type play count by hour so if I'm going to do server maintenance or something like that I might want to do it between 9 and 10 AM because those are the hours that there's absolutely no activity on the server play count by platform top users just a lot of stuff stream type play totals duration last 12 months we could see specific history so we could see everything that has been streaming here for how long how long it was paused just a ridiculous unnecessarily ridiculous amount of data but that's just one thing I'm addicted to is having access to a ridiculous amount of data so that is my media playback stuff at least when it comes to video TV shows music now I'm going to talk about my download clients and for that we have nzb git and divulge or bulge VPN this does have an integrated VPN real quick I'm going to go to my unread instance here which Kyle kind of give me a better way to explain how this works so here is everything running on my unread instance we have the VPN here and we have nzb git now this has a built-in VPN I'm using openvpn with private internet access and what I'm doing is I'm feeding nzb git through divulge so it says the network for the nzb git container is this container here so that means I have a VPN set up on both of my download clients now last time I did this I did leak my password I'm not going to do that again we have the user the password the actual VPN provider Pia is one of the default ones here and they were kind enough to sponsor this video if you don't know what a VPN is basically it is a way to hide your IP address from prying eyes my main use case is torrents if I'm downloading something like an Ubuntu torrent for example I don't really want people seeing my IP address when you use torrents your IP becomes public because you are connected to other peers and they can see that what private internet access this will do is one encrypt your connection to one of their own servers and then from there other people who can see your IP address will see it as that server that you're connecting to instead of your actual personal IP address you can also use it to connect to various places in the world PA has a bunch of different locations that you can pick from and basically pretend that's where you are another thing there's actually a graphical utility for Linux which is very nice not a lot of them actually do that including Windows Mac Android iPhone really whatever you need and this right here is what I'm actually kind of using for the docker container we have the oh VPN files this is directly from Pia support these are the configuration files that's what I'm personally using for my kind of home lab setup if you check out the link down below you can get 83 off and four extra months completely for free and when it comes to the actual kind of user interface this is the torrent client it's very standard when it comes to torrents you can add remove pause start up down if I go into preferences for example you can customize just about everything where it goes I have everything at least in a data root directory because in a lot of other applications such as sonar radar can see all that and move files around accordingly that's very important if I go to network here you can see it's using the ton 0 which is the actual VPN tunnel and if the VPN ever for some reason like if I forget to pay it or whatever it won't work it will automatically disconnect and I'll just get a bunch of Errors which is good now nzbiga is a little bit more complicated this uses what's called news servers to actually find and pull various files for example if you're downloading what's the ah there it is Big Buck Bunny nzb clients are a little more complicated because you need both a news server which kind of houses all the files and you need a indexer separately that can actually kind of locate various files and put them together so for example if you want to download a big bug bunny MP4 it might be split up in between a variety of locations in like a bunch of raw part files and then nzb get mixed with your indexer and new server will automatically download all those separate parts extract it together and then move it to where it needs to be and this right here is what nzb git looks like it's very similar to a torrent client except for in the back end it does a lot more different things and I like nzb get one that's written in C plus plus so it's a little quicker than the alternative and two I like just how the interface is set up we have our new servers categories RSS feeds everything we want to put in here so those are our download clients and from there I'm going to go over to the r Suite of applications some of these I'm not going to open up I'm just going to give you a brief description of at least Prowler Prowler is a place that you're going to put your indexers and then you can link up like sonar radar to prowler and it'll automatically pull your indexers into those two applications it's really nice really easy to use radar and sonar do the exact same thing this is for movies this is for shows now this right here is kind of the default page of radar for example what it does is you link it up to your media server it'll automatically pull everything in for you so for example here we can see some of the back to the Futures if I am to click on this one for example it gives you a lot of information about your media so we can see the location some information here we could go over to the cast The Crew we could see the files there's a search functionality what you really shouldn't use because you should be backing up your very own media into this and using it for things such as the preview rename this is really nice let's say you have a have a box set of friends and you ripped the entire box set and you don't want to go through and rename every single file this as long as it can kind of make out what the file is it will do this for you and you can set custom variables and how you want this to work for example I do have the quality built into the names this file doesn't have the quality so all I would do is Click organize and then it's said it's been completed and now for history we have the fact right here that it went ahead and renamed that file for us so just one of the kind of cool functionalities with this and then sonar here is basically the exact same deal but for TV shows now from there over C error is going to be another really cool one if we sign in here we sign in with our Plex account there's also a jelly fin alternative to this one that integrates with that instead of Plex but here we can see a lot of things we have our recently added we have the recent requests you can have like the people who are in your Plex instance sign into this and then find explore movies so if I go over here to movies for example this is by popularity descending so like Barbie is going to be up here Indiana Jones Elemental things like that if I wanted like the flash for example what I could do is send a request to the server administrator and then the server admin can uh go out and buy a DVD of it rip it and then put it on the server so you can kind of stream it in your house so without having to plug in the good old DVD player it's really cool though the amount of data and statistics it gives you you have like the release date Revenue budget typical like IMDb type stuff but like finding things is cool because like we could go to series for example we could go to active filters and there are a lot of options for example if you're somebody who like has Netflix but doesn't have Hulu and you're like I wonder what's popular on Hulu you could click that and then we can see Law and Order CIS American Dad are the popular things on Hulu so from there we're going to go to two more kind of media server Services one is audio bookshelf and I have talked about this in a whole dedicated video this is really cool it's basically your own version of audible if I go to this one right here the body keeps score we can see our audio track separated out by the chapters I could go back to home here uh don't judge my library too much I got a lot of this in here for free such as some of the history stuff and the libertarian mind but go to like David Goggins can't hurt me you can see chapters because this was actually one I purchased and imported from audible audible is actually kind of cool because it allows you to download the files you need to stream these on your own servers so it's kind of a benefit in that regard but audio bookshelf super cool service I use it quite a bit and if you want to go a little more old school you don't want to listen to a book you want to read a book this right here is what I'm currently using you can see the actual books I have in here I have some textbooks Cadillac desert was a textbook for one of my classes I'm reading walkable City at the moment and this is nice if I open up walkable City we could read it as is or if I click on this for example we have a bunch of different options to customize it to be uh visually how we'd prefer it from font size the actual line spacing the margin so you can make it substantially skinnier if you'd like to and then we have some other reader settings that may be helpful and then color theming so really cool nice little reading tool something I would definitely recommend if you have some sort of e-look Library the alternative to this would be calibrate web which is also another phenomenal tool but I just think that this is prettier from there another service that I'm running which honestly I haven't used as much as I should is called Fresh RSS this is a RSS reader and kind of collection tool I'll open this up probably once a week or so and kind of skim through it you can see I use it for a lot of Linux news I have a gaming on Linux OMG Ubuntu so here you can see everything I could star things toggle as red if I open it so um this OMG Ubuntu article if I click on this I could see some of the article here or I could click on it to view the entire thing if I'm interested in that I could favorite it so if there's a bunch of headlines that are interesting to me I can favorite them and then head back to it later and there's a bunch of other settings we have our subscription management here so you can see my Linux category we have uncategorized here you can add various categories and it's a really really nice utility yeah you to run an RSS reader on my desktop computer but I'm always switching things around and uninstalling things having a service like this always just available and ready in a Docker container on my home lab is definitely the preference and from there at least in these top two rows we have a mealy now this is a very very new addition and by very very new I mean probably the last couple days I've added this and started playing around with it but it seems super cool and I'm going to be using it more and more as I learn it it is a meal kind of aggregation tool that allows you to pull recipes from sources on the internet for example here I have some roasted broccoli soup it has all the steps the ingredients and overall it works really good if I go to the original URL it's going to open up all recipes and this is where I pulled it from and there's like ads and everything on this it's not a very fun experience just an example if I go to salads here and I wanted to make oh this looks really good let's say I wanted this recipe right here I would grab the URL go back to my kind of self-hosted instance click on create import recipe by URL paste it in Click create and in a matter of a second or two boom there we go and of course you don't have to just input you could create your own recipes manually there's cookbooks tags categories timeline they have shopping lists which you can make based on recipes you want to cook out of a meal planner a bunch of different stuff I haven't explored as much as I would like to but it's something I've started as I said getting more and more into from there we have Tesla made I currently have a model 3 got a pretty good deal after like the tax credit and all that I'm gonna have to be really touchy because I'm not trying to show you guys exactly where I am but here we have a little map gives you my Tesla the status the range a bunch of different data but where it gets real crazy is if we go over here into dashboards we have a atomically large amount of Statistics if I go to statistics this opens up a grafana dashboard now here we can see just on this little dashboard here we have this month if I go to this month you could see a whole heck of a lot we have a map of everywhere I've traveled we have the distance the net internet you we have the distance the net electricity usage the charging versus driving time down here we have links to very specific drives so I opened up this drive here this doesn't really have any sensitive information this is a drive from a rec center to KFC and we can see here just say absolutely comically a ridiculous amount of data specific distance energy used in this chart we have speed power battery heater range rated and estimate we have tire pressure if we go here we have the elevation changes in this specific drive and as we kind of Chase or Trace through this chart you could see the exact location on when the data is collected and if I go down I can see like temperatures and things just an absolute comical amount of stuff there are like other third-party applications for this but the problem with those in my opinion is then you're just uploading all your like very specific travel data into some third-party server somewhere this frankly is completely unnecessary but it's pretty cool it's on my server so I'm way more comfortable kind of having something collect all this granted the Tesla and Tesla themselves are probably collecting it themselves anyways but you win some you lose some and just a little overview these are all the different charts we have stata statistics timeline this is in grafana which is beautiful as you saw Drive status Drive sufficiency locations status right here which this is cool it gives you a overview of when you were charging when you're online when you're actually driving in these brief little blips of purple I have it parked 90 97 of the time so far just just some really cool stuff here and something I literally installed to date this right here is Chasm do note there might be a little bit of bias they're going to be sponsoring a video in the future so so just keep note of that if we go over to workspaces I have a fedora 38 desktop as well as Tor Browser this is all running in Docker containers so for example if I'm uh to open Fedora 38 I want to open it up in the current tab let's launch a session this is cool because I'm probably going to be replacing what I currently do which is a Synology VM for this when it comes to externally connecting to my home network so we have chromium Sublime Text only office buyer Fox bunch of different stuff and it's pretty quick whoa allow let's open up chromium you can see it is very Snappy and for I think it's VLC or vcl running this it is very smooth and it works really good for example Gip is kind of a beefier application if we open that up you can see it really didn't take long at all whole remote desktop kind of built-in Docker container is really easy to spin up and you can see here if I go back this is the current instance I have up it expires in the 59 minutes so automatically delete and close that instance so adds a bunch of security of course you could change that you could keep them up for custom amounts of time and whatnot if I'm to go over to admin you can set up a whole bunch of these if you want to let's go to workspaces workspaces and if I want to go to the workspace registry this is the default registry that they have available Rocky Linux parrot OS we have only office filezilla Doom so if I open Doom just click install it's a fairly quick process so if I go installed workspaces and just kind of let that do its thing for a minute hey there we go so let's go back over to our workspaces and if I'm to open up Doom in the current actually let's do this in a new tab launch session there we go we have over here a little dashboard of everything that we have access to and fail you all get the point it's pretty cool also retro Arch is an option so I think I'd be able to get like n60 or SNES games and stuff working so that's basically it when it comes to the standard like kind of Doc container applications we have all the other stuff is mostly Network infrastructure in the actual dashboards for our Nas units I have the Synology machine and unread machine and a Intel Nook running this protainer I've talked about unread quite a bit in the past that is my favorite bar none software that you could put on just about anything it's really easy to manage your various shares we have our dashboard here where we can see our shares our statistics all the docker containers that I have running there I really like how unray does it if you go under apps they're really mostly just Docker containers you could pull them through here if I'm to install something such as a super meteors I'm not actually going to install it just show you that it's for the most part standard Docker kind of settings that you can set that up and then everything is over here really easy just to update everything through here if you want to overall I love unread if I'm to pick one thing to run every day versus serenology and kind of the kind of default Ubuntu Server protein or instance I have up it would definitely be unraid now with that I did mention I have a Synology Nas basically none of the docker containers or anything like that are running through it this primarily is just a file backup server mostly chronology photos I have a lot of my like phone pictures automatically synced to it through Synology photos this runs my surveillance system which is just like three cameras set up right now I did use the virtual machine manager quite a bit you can see I have a Windows 10 virtual machine which is what I used to kind of connect to my home network externally I would log into this dashboard and use that virtual machine and run Windows as if I'm in my home network that's kind of my use case for that over here you see little Cloud check I have cloud sink I have a like video project archive in Google Drive when I move things to the archive it will automatically download into this server so some pretty cool synchronization features in that regard additionally I don't have a very complex like reverse proxy setup I'm just using the integrated kind of ddens system which will uh IP addresses change here and there so there's software built into this that will kind of recognize when your IP address changes and then update an a record automatically to change the IP address on the actual domain you use I believe that's under external access yeah right here we have ddns cloudflare is custom I'm probably not going to end up using that and then the integrated Synology one is really nice and with that if I go to control panel login portal Advanced reverse proxy is hidden in here and here you can see DSM Plex op audio bookshelf and overseer I all have set up through reverse proxy this uses um I believe cert bot so everything has a SSL certificate so just very nice really easy to use system I'm not in like a network administrator right my skill levels limited when it comes to that and just really easy to set up for my firewall and all that I just use a Synology router it is linked up they kind of integrate together really well it's simple it's not complex it's not even worth diving into I do have CenturyLink like I said so I'm using a pppoe or something like that so I don't have a separate like modem and router just kind of all in one really nice setup and then last but not least we have protainer which I did dive into a little bit earlier but now since I opened up an instance you could kind of see the cavana these two right here this one's doom and this one's Fedora they will automatically delete after 60 Minutes as I currently have it set up so that's nice and you can see all the other containers I have running through here protainer is almost a must on any system that you have Docker installed it's just way easier to use than something like rancher in my opinion I don't understand kubernetes but this for just spinning up like basic Stacks so you could see some of the stacks where I have here so if we go to my Tesla mate stack which I'm going to end up having to blur a lot of it out you can see here we have services and all the different containers that all kind of integrate and just are connected to each other really nice stuff and that is basically my entire home lab setup at least when it comes to the software side of things down below I'll link to a vast majority of everything that I talked about including that deal on private internet access if you are setting up a lot of this stuff you are going to want a VPN and that is definitely the one I recommend and have been using for years now with all that I do hope you have an absolutely beautiful day have fun setting up your home lab it is definitely addicting and fun you don't really need anything more than like a little zimmabort a little mini PC to get started even an old laptop or desktop you could probably find on like Facebook market for 100 bucks get an old like think station or something like that it's fun it's worth it try it out I do recommend an Intel machine for getting started especially for like Plex Hardware encoding but even that's not necessarily necessary because if you have the right formats you don't need to have Hardware encoding I can keep rambling on forever I'm going to myself off and wish you a beautiful day and goodbye",
