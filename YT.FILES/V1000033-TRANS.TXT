  "transcript": "open AI has caused a way for startups all powered by the exact same technology but why are some of them so successful generating millions of dollars every month While others are struggling to make a penny in my opinion the key to successful AI startups lies in how they package their Solutions not even how unique or powerful their use cases are if you look at charge APK for example many people think that it became the fastest growing app because of the New Ireland Chef technique that open AI has developed so modern AI influencers even considered this to be a novel technology that has only existed for a few months however everything that charging PT can do such as summarizing text writing an article or developing code has been possible with gpt3 for over 2 years before its release the groundbreaking feature of charge GPT is not in its underlying technology but rather in its convenient user-friendly and intuitive chat interface which allows almost anyone in the world to utilize this technology without any technical knowledge my name is arseni and I'm a full-time freelancer with over four years of experience developing custom AI solutions for businesses worldwide recently I started my own AI agency which is currently generating around 10K a month in profit and in this video I will guide you to the entire process that we use for almost every AI driven web project from scoping your application to deploying it in the cloud and integrating AI so whether you're a developer looking to launch your first AI powered app or a startup founder seeking to clarify your vision this guide will help you to craft a clear roadmap and make your application a great success let's get started first let's discuss the prerequisites for deploying your AI application the good news is that you do not need any prior knowledge or experience in Ai and machine learning just a few years ago this was not the case I remember having to train my own custom models for each specific task such as classifying emails or writing articles the process was not easy and heavily relied on the quality and quantity of your data nowadays you can use the same model for a variety of tasks simply by switching The Prompt as for the web interfaces and back-end prerequisites vary greatly based on your project scope for smaller or internal projects there are almost no prerequisites as well for large-scale applications however some development experience may be necessary nevertheless you can always Outsource the part that you are least familiar with to someone else what truly matters for the success of your application is knowing your options and having a clear understanding of the problem you're trying to solve this is why the first step to any successful AI application is scoping your project A good rule of thumb for scoping your project is to focus your application on a single concrete problem and then build the rest of the scope around that problem for example chat PDF would still be chat PDF without the PDF preview feature because that's not why people use it however if there was no chat interface it would not surf its purpose therefore think about how you will provide value to your users and only then start brainstorming the rest of the project I personally use gpt4 with the chaining technique for helping me brainstorm the rest of the scope first I provide it with a bit of context and Define the main problem in the case of chat PDF example the core issue is to help users save time when searching for information within their documents then I ask you to construct a plan for this project scope a refined the plan is necessary by removing or elaborating on certain parts after that I write a small project brief and tell it to scope the project using my project brief according to my refined plan this already provides me with a better idea of potential goals constraints and requirements however remember that gpt4 is only useful for brainstorming it does not know all the context about your project only you do so make sure to adjust the scope accordingly as for the timelines and cost estimates do not even listen to gpt4 Define them yourself and make sure to give yourself at least two times more time than you think it will take especially if you're just getting started after you have defined your scope you can then start thinking about the technology stack the first part of your application is the front end which serves as a layer of abstraction for your model you have three options no code low code and code no code essentially means developing your application with drag and drop tools or pre-built templates one of its biggest advantages is the ability to create an appealing user interface quickly with no prior experience no code Solutions are highly visual enabling you to combine the design and implementation phases of your project together this makes no code a great choice for quickly creating an MVP to pitch investors or potential clients some of the most popular no code platforms include bubble.io software and Google app sheet however I would not recommend taking a no code app to production because it can be extremely challenging to scale and customize down the line besides pricing can become exorbitant at scale for instance a no-code chatbot built with bot press charges around 5 cents per message and although it may seem insignificant the pricing for the open AI API for a similar message is approximately 200 times less this can become a great issue at scale therefore I recommend using no code apps only as a demo and switch to a different solution as soon as possible low code provides more flexibility compared to no code and does not have any monthly subscription fees however it requires some development experience or at least a basic understanding of a programming language like python nevertheless if you know how to ask the right questions you can use gpt4 for AI driven development with minimal cogent experience the two most popular UI libraries are streamlit and gradual both of them have tons of pre-built templates that you can simply copy and deploy in an instant you can also easily customize the interface for your specific use case this option is great for internal or personal projects because it allows you to quickly prototype and deploy your application without having to build everything from scratch and although the interface might not be as appealing as with no code Solutions low code gives your app a lot more control and makes it much easier to maintain in a long run and last but not least the third option is to go to traditional route and hand code your interface from scratch the biggest advantage of a hand-coded solution is its flexibility and performance there are almost no limits to where you can take your application because you have full control over the design and implementation however it does require significant development experience in a much larger time investment when it comes to deploying Your solution I don't element using plain HTML and CSS as it can make your application feel outdated instead you should leverage a front-end framework such as react VJs or angular personally I use nexjs for almost all of my projects which is built on top of react and adds additional features like server-side rendering and static side generation another important consideration should be a component Library which is a collection of pre-built UI components that can significantly speed up the development time mui tailwind and bootstrap are among the most commonly used options personally I prefer material UI because it provides the best developer experience and eliminates the need to write any CSS code for multi-page applications you might also need a state management solution like Redux I recommend using custom coding for any serious project where you plan to charge the end user still front end is only a part of your technology stack and to ensure its success arguably the back end is even more important most no code and local Solutions already provide you with a simple backend you can easily deploy out of the box so in the following sections we will focus on developing the back end and deploying it for a custom coded large-scale project and the first step to choosing your backend is to determine your architecture the two most common options for SAS platforms are serverless and monolithic basically in a monolithic architecture the application is deployed as a single unit when with serverless each feature is deployed as a separate function initially developing a monolithic architecture may seem easier but it becomes much more difficult to maintain and scale over time in contrast serverless architecture may be harder to get started with but it is much easier to maintain and scale because you can always update each function independently for an AI driven application I recommend using serverless architecture because certain functions such as calling the model and processing the data for example may need to be triggered and updated much more often than others after selecting your architecture you need to choose an appropriate database the two most common options are SQL and nosql SQL or relational databases can be challenging to scale horizontally although Solutions exist nosql databases on the other hand are more flexible and designed for easier horizontal scaling personally I use serverless architecture coupled with the nosql document oriented database for 90 of the projects both of which are provided by Firebase other similar options include Super Bass mongodb and AWS amplify now that you have defined your front-end and back-end setup it's time to integrate AI into your application in most cases you will need to make API calls to the AI platform that you are using in order to obtain predictions from your model if you are using custom trained model you may also need to choose a suitable deployment option and create an API yourself which is exactly what I discussed in one of my previous videos however unless data privacy concerns require you to use an open source model I strongly recommend using a cam commercial solution for a couple of reasons firstly setting up scaling and maintaining these models is much more difficult secondly the profit margins associated with the use of commercial models remain extremely large for example according to Open the Eyes pricing a charger PT Plus subscription for twenty dollars is roughly equivalent to generating 10 million tokens with GPT 3.5 turbo this approximately equals to 100 average size novels or 7.5 million words I'm certain that most users do not even utilize one tenth of their subscriptions therefore only consider open source models if it is absolutely necessary for your use case once you have selected your model you have two options calling it from the client or from the server calling the model from the client can achieve lower latency but may not be suitable for heavy workloads requiring data processing on the other hand calling the model from the server can reduce the load on the client side but may also add extra costs in my opinion it is best to use client-side requests only for very basic calls for instance if you need to send a plain prompt without any processing use the client however if your request requires additional processing such as pulling the contacts from a vector database use the server this will allow you to reduce the workload and optimize for efficiency and latency and lastly don't forget to handle the errors open AI API requests in production often fail due to rate limited to avoid this wrap your openai API calls with the return library like tenacity this will repeat the request in case it fails check out the open AI documentation for more details another helpful tip is to use a special prompt in case of any errors for instance if the model fails to query the database rather than simply stating that the query turned no results you can ask the user to be more specific this approach makes the application feel more robust once your application is developed and tested it's time to deploy it the deployment process varies depending on your chosen technology stack for most developer friendly sdks such as Firebase you only need to run a single command to deploy your app or even just to push a commit to your main branch after that this service will automatically rebuild and deploy your application sometimes however you may need to deploy your app in a custom container or handle load balancing and advanced configurations in such cases I recommend using gpt4 for guidance on deployment commands it can provide extremely accurate suggestions and it personally saves me hours of work the deployment process used to require don't forget to enable the web browsing plugin so the model can retrieve the latest documentation lastly keep in mind that often after your application is deployed you might find yourself in a so-called vendor looking which means that it may be difficult or even impossible to switch to a different provider without significant changes to your code base so make sure to consider the potential long-term implications of your decisions in advance to help illustrate the process let's take a look at three different one-page AI driven web applications we have developed with different Scopes and Technology the first example is an app called wisdom whisper which is similar to chat PDF but specifically designed for a book called four sacred Secrets it features clickable examples on the left and a PDF view on the right as requested by the client the app is using Firebase functions Firestar and Firebase hosting making it simple to deploy and test with just a few commands one cool feature of this application is its ability to transcribe voice messages using the whisper API for this feature we make a call directly from the client as no additional processing as required to handle the response in chat however we have a separate backend function with all the dependencies that are needed to query the vector database the next application is a chat widget that I previously showcased on this channel the setup is very similar except in this case we had to deploy the back end using fast API in a container this is necessary because serverless functions do not support server-side events which are required to create a nice typing effect on the front end we decided to add this feature because latency is crucial for these types of applications the third application is an AI driven Customer Support Center designed for product marketing Alliance it can answer questions using its knowledge base and is deployed with Firebase as well despite having a relatively High number of active monthly users we still have not reached the generous free usage quota that Firebase allows this application also has an additional feature that adds confirmed users email addresses to the client CRM after registration they are using xjs and material UI for the front end on all of these applications in conclusion I believe that while the use of no code and SAS platforms for the development of AI applications will continue to grow some level of customization will always be required as AI models become increasingly productized by large companies the success of your project will ultimately depend on the convenience of your interface The Challenge in a modern AI application development is not the performance or uniqueness of your model but rather the seamlessness of your integration the better you can integrate your AI solution into people's everyday lives the more likely you are to succeed so here are five takeaways from this video that will help you make your application as convenient as possible one focus on solving a specific problem and design a user interface around that problem two determine your front end based on where you plan to use your application three thoroughly consider your back end stack and avoid vendor lock-in and maintenance issues at scale 4. account for all possible errors when integrating Ai and five deploy your application on the provider that fits best with your stack that's it now I hope that you have a clear roadmap to take your AI application to the next level remember to always listen to customer feedback and be ready to Pivot along the way let me know if you have any questions in the comments and I hope your application becomes a great success",
