  "transcript": "hello everyone David Shapiro here so I'm going to try a new thing and this is going to be a systems thinking uh podcast so this is going to be an audio only format obviously and we're just going to roll with it and see how it goes so for the inaugural episode I am just going to answer the question what is a system we need to unpack what a system is before we dive into systems thinking so there are many definitions of systems out there but for the sake of systems thinking this is how I Define a system a system is a collection of nodes linkages and boundaries now I'm not going to just leave you hanging with that because we need to unpack what each of those three components are so again that's nodes linkages and boundaries so first what is a node a node is a person place or thing it can be concrete or uh abstract or conceptual but the idea is that a node is some kind of entity it is it is a thing that participates with other things that either may be similar to that thing or different from that thing so for instance a system of people is going to be the interaction of many people so democracy is a system a school is a system a company is a system all of those are systems of people now you can have other kinds of nodes so for instance in a car you might have uh mechanical nodes you might have electrical nodes you might have chemical nodes so nodes can basically be any kind of self-contained entity and then they don't even necessarily need to be self-contained they generally are so a person is self-contained a building is self-contained a uh the motor of a vehicle is self-contained now that doesn't mean that they don't have many many linkages or interconnects between uh themselves and other nodes but generally it is it is some kind of entity person place or thing uh concrete or abstract now the second part of a system is the linkages so uh linkages are those connections or interconnects um that that bind all of the nodes together and so linkages uh transmit uh one or more of these three things they transmit matter energy or information um or what I might also call signals so information or signals um and they transmit those between two or more nodes and so what I mean by that is uh so say for instance um the fuel lines in your car those are linkages that transmit matter in the form of gasoline or diesel from the fuel tank to the fuel injectors so that is that is a matter linkage um conversely or similarly the power lines that bring energy to your home are linkages that bring uh electrical energy from the uh Power substation to your house and so that's another kind of linkage and then another the the final kind is an information linkage which uh actually what you're listening to right now uh a podcast is a kind of information linkage the internet is uh provides a bunch of kind of uh information linkages now many linkages are both so for instance or or more than one and so what I mean by that is the fuel lines that carry gasoline from your fuel tank to your motor those are carrying matter which is a it's it's a chemical form of energy so that is technically both matter and energy likewise uh the electrical signals that are that are carrying my voice through you know the internet and time and space to you are energy and information so generally linkages carry one or more of those usually it's not entirely pure just due to the nature of physics but matter energy and information are what are transmitted over the linkages um between nodes and a node so the linkage can be it has to be between two or more and and so these linkages in some cases you have many to one so a many to one linkage is lots and lots of other connections coming to one Central thing and so uh this would be an example of all the data streams that you consume on a daily basis so you have uh you know all your internet signals all the information that you get from friends and family and workplaces and that sort of thing so in that system at in the at the information system where you are the Hub that is a many to one linkage now the opposite of that is a on to many linkage and so in this case me as a content creator I Am The Hub and I'm broadcasting outward so that is a broadcast kind of linkage and then in many other cases so you might just have a one:1 ratio uh such as the connection between a fuel tank and the motor so that is a onetoone connection now it could be more sophisticated than that so for instance in a uh in an airplane you have several fuel tanks and several engin to connect to so you have several to several uh but the point is is that um that is the nature of linkage linkages and then finally the last part of a system is boundaries so boundaries um the way that I Define it is that is the sphere of influence of a system that is the domain in which that system has the most influence or impact and so in some cases the boundaries of a system are very hard they're literally rigid uh such as the the body of a car or the skin of a person um or the exterior of a building in those cases the boundaries are physical and they're visible and they're tangible uh now in other cases though boundaries are a little bit more flexible fuzzy or porous so there's kind of four types of boundaries that I keep track of so rigid flexible fuzzy or porous and I'm not going to unpack each individual one but you can kind of get an idea so an example of a a flexible boundary is a friend group or a social group and so imagine that you're at the bar with some friends and then you know some new people show up and join your group and then some people leave that is a flexible boundary where there is a there is a social container there's a social system where the boundaries are constantly being updated so that is that is a kind of flexible system a fuzzy system would be one like let's say uh the boundaries between um one neighborhood and another it's not necessarily clear where the boundaries lie um and it kind of depends or it's it's a little bit vague or it's not you know it's more conceptual so conceptual boundaries tend to be fuzzier and then you can also have porous boundaries where you do have a boundary but it is it allows the influence of other systems to go in it or through it and so this is an example of like a highway system or a state or a city the boundaries between many of those kinds of systems are very porous meaning they intersect with many many other systems um if a human system however is porous that's usually something you go to the doctor for so anyways this has been the first episode of systems thinking with David Shapiro uh what is a system uh quick recap it is a collection of nodes linkages and boundaries nodes can be a person place or thing concrete or abstract some kind of self-contained entity linkages are connections that transmit matter energy or information between two or more nodes you can have one to many many to one one to one and so on and then finally boundaries the sphere of influence of a system and you can have rigid flexible or rigid flexible fuzzy or porous there we go I about said futy you can have futy systems too um rigid flexible fuzzy or porous boundaries between systems so this is my working definition of systems as it pertains to systems thinking and I hope you tune in next time
