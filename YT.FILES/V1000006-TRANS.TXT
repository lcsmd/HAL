  "transcript": "everybody so it's been a while since I've been posting regularly yeah I wanted to touch base and kind of share where I've been so you know you've probably seen some of my polls if you're a longtime uh follower of the channel I'm always posting uh polls to kind of see where the audience is at and there's been a few uh kind of vibe changes or SE changes um the Paradigm has been shifting slowly uh so for those of us that have been in the space for a while uh you know glove and and semantic embedding when that first came out you know Google's Universal sentence encoder um those sorts of things came out what 2015 2016 that was a paradigm shift and then it was a few years before gpt2 then a little bit less time for gpt3 now GPT 4 um but not only not only is are the Paradigm shifts compressing on individual companies there's more of them as more companies participate and so everyone has noticed this year the the joke is if you go more than hours without a you know major breakthrough announced in AI that's that's the AI winter and so this phenomenon is actually predicted perfectly by Ray CTSV in the age of spiritual machines and so having read this book um and I didn't I didn't read the end I didn't I wasn't as I didn't care as much about the predictions um but the data um the timelines the data and the model that Rey uses to understand what's happening that's what is really compelling to me and and so what you should be paying attention to as we ramp up to Singularity or change or AGI or whatever is Paradigm shifts and so the way that Sam Alman described it is uh what was it he said Slow takeoff with short intervals and so those short intervals are these Paradigm shifts and so basically it's not going to be you know we wake up one day and AGI is there and then we have you know warp drive the next day instead these Paradigm shifts are uh exemplified you can even take it back a a longer uh timeline so one example is looking at human evolution and this has been used in a few different places um they even talked about it in three body problem I binged three body problem the other day when I wasn't feeling well um and so the idea is how long did it take for humans to emerge or protohumans to emerge it took more than a billion years of evolution for you know hominids to emerge and then from there it was a few million years to get to you know something that is recognizably human and then only a few hundred th000 years to get to intelligence 10,000 years to get to agriculture a th000 years to get from pre-industrial to post-industrial and so on and so forth and so human evolution is accelerating not necessarily on a biological sense but on a technological sense and so there's been TED Talks that call this like teams so like a technological uh uh Gene where we're able to build off of each other and so uh another way of thinking about it is technology is is evolution by another means and in this respect evolution is accelerating so I ran a poll and I I think I think it's okay to talk about this because I ran a poll um a few weeks ago a couple months ago that basically said like are we building a successor species are we building a Global super organism and most of you are on board with this idea so I'm I'm still talking about this idea with some researchers and philosophers that I know um I just sent them an email this morning um but but the idea is that we are evolving and it's because of the complexity of the situation we don't know what we're evolving to so most people that I've talked to agree that this is what's called a complex adaptive system and so a complex adaptive system is when you have two or more uh parallel systems or entities that feed off of each other and manipulate each other so one of the most common examples is the stock market and if you've been following the stock market at all over the last few years you probably know like the meme stocks like GameStop and so that's an example of a complex adaptive system where you have a Marketplace for a stock price and then you have like the Reddit people and the 4chan people and then you have the finance people and then you have the Regulators so you have multiple parties all trying to influence the system um and it's feeding off of each other and so this is where you get things like pump and dump schemes that is an example of you know by by manipulating the the Nate the the the numbers and the data and the narrative you can get one behavior and then the stock price changes and that changes everyone's behavior and so on and so forth so artificial intelligence is also a complex adapt system just as the internet is a complex adaptive system um and in aggregate you know there's the there's emergent qualities like what does the internet want uh the incentives of the internet is is attention you know we you've probably heard of the attention economy but why the attention economy was not necessarily built by humans the attention economy emerged as the the hunger of the internet Because the Internet is just built to pass data that's what the internet wants quote unquote the internet wants to pass data so the best way that it can pass data is by capturing your attention and the best way to capture your attention is through things like social media uh Netflix and streaming services and so on and so forth and so from an aggregate perspective from a from a Global Perspective you could say that that the internet as the global nervous system wanted attention and so it is the thing that invented social media it is the thing that invented streaming services and then of course as the demand for throughput for internet bandwidth goes up so then the internet builds itself uh larger and we are just the worker nodes we're the ants we're the drones building this larger system now as we introduce artificial intelligence into the system it is another set of entities or is another layer of intelligence and processing and so the the Advent of AI the the integration of AI into the internet will change the structure of the internet again change the structure of humanity and the global superorganism uh Again by creating new affordances new um new desires basically new emergent Desires in This Global superorganism now another way that I characterize it is that if you look at Humanity up until this point and in aggregate our Behavior has been no different from you know bacteria spreading across the surface of a petri dish we are as individual atomized entities just growing and reproducing and spreading um until we fill up the petri dish and now of course um we're getting close to filling up the petri dish that's why uh one of the reasons why you know things are more expensive that's called econom compaction um so competition gets higher resources get more scarce the environment starts to degrade so that the environment's ability to uh sustain us is is degrading all of this is perfectly predictable when you look at the growth of populations and so basically we are at our natural caring capacity now I will admit that there are it is very likely that some technologies could extend the caring capacity of the planet but with our current technological level we're actually beyond the carrying capacity of the planet you know if everyone lived like Americans you've probably heard like it would take three Earths to you know support everyone having an American lifestyle it would take Two Earths to have to support everyone living a European lifestyle so we are we are currently we're in overshoot right now technology could change that but then of course you might say okay well if we increase the caring capacity then we'll just expand to that caring capacity again but getting back to the Petri dis analogy we in aggregate have no coordination we have very little coordination just in the same way that you know a bunch of amoebas on a petri dish or a bunch of you know bacteria on a petri dish They Don't Really coordinate they just kind of grow mindlessly until they fill up their environment or they run out of food or whatever but the internet is the first phase of creating an actual intelligent species an actual Global in uh amount of coordination the fact that I can have Global reach as an individual thinker as an individual contributor to the human race and that there are literally hundreds of thousands of more people like me um talking on every issue not just artificial intelligence but on social issues political issues legal issues um the fact that that um all of us mavens that's kind of an information term um the people that aggregate specific topics and then you know rebroadcast it to make sense of the world that's why I have an audience base that's what you people like um when you tell me in the comments like you want the distilled idea to what's going on and that's the purpose of this video is to like hey let's let's uh let's level set let's let's uh recalibrate so um with artificial intelligence which is um even if it has desires of its own even once it becomes agentic it's going to be somewhat orthogonal to our interest just in the same way that the internet is somewhat orthogonal to our interest what the internet wants is not necessarily what's best for us which is why social media is toxic because the internet as a hive mind as a super intelligence as a digital entity is already an alien form of intelligence you're already working with alien intelligence it's just bigger you can't really see see it you're already working with a hive mind um now when you add artificial intelligence as another layer to that the internet then becomes more conscious and I don't mean conscious in a philosophical sense I'm not saying that it has subjective experience that the you know it is something to be like the internet what I mean is that it can be more deliberative it can be more conscientious and intentional about what it does and what it wants and particularly as we have ai co-pilots helping us and so one example I've been using recently is perplexity and so what what Ry talks about in his book is the difference between Order and Chaos and so artificial intelligence brings order to chaos and that order is also what causes acceleration and so perplexity is I think right now the best example of a tool that fundamentally changes our our uh our relationship to information because like yes chat Bots like Claude and stuff that are that are closed off from the internet they're very helpful but their only IO is you uh whereas perplexity it can go talk to the internet for you all these other um agents and stuff that are that have tool use and API use you're not the only IO that they have access to but what happens when you introduce these tools is your access to information one becomes much much faster if you've used tools like perplexity to do research you will know that it is 100 times Les less e effortful than just using Google it the tool sells itself very very easily um now not only is it less effortful that means that it is faster and it also generally produces higher quality and so for for some people that I've seen go through the Journey of before perplexity and after perplexity um their information literacy goes up by default their media literacy goes up by default because it is baked into the tool now this will on an individual level you might say oh hey I have a better understanding of issues out in the world I have a better access to scientific information political information economic whatever information that you're looking for you have better access to it but now repeat that 8 billion times once 8 billion people have access to tools like perplexity that's going to change the entire information landscape and bring a lot more order to the chaos that is the internet today now you might say okay what is what's the difference what does that mean why does that matter and the reason is because these Paradigm shifts these in these accelerating Paradigm shifts that we've all been feeling you know uh chat GPT was the first big like Global paradigm shift um and I think that Sora and those other kinds of tools are going to be the next one maybe GPT 5 maybe llama 3 um but those Paradigm shifts are going to get closer and closer together uh because we're bringing more and more order to the chaos and right now it's just language um you know there's Alpha full 2 which brings a little bit more order to um the the biotech landscape um but that's going to accelerate that's going to compress and so AI you know when when gpt2 and gpt3 first became a thing a lot of people were like as the as the internet was trying to understand like what is it that we've made a lot of people said oh it's just a kind of compression you've just compressed the entire internet into one model and that's actually from an information perspective that's not actually a bad way of thinking about it because if you can embed literally all of human knowledge into a few trillion parameters or you know 100 billion parameters that's a pretty significant amount of compression that has happened but also it's not just compression it is then also Interactive it is now an information entity and by entity I don't mean like you know uh a being I just mean that it is a self-contained uh apparatus um that allows you to have access to pretty much any information that you need and that is also accelerationist and so basically you know the the whole point of this video is that acceleration is the default and you can look at it not from an intuitive perspective so my last video uh you know was a little bit controversial um but my point is you can't trust your intuition our our Savannah monkey brains are not evolved to intuitively understand what's going on our emotional brains our lyic system is also not evolved to really understand what's going on you might you might feel the vibe shift right you might you might feel um that that things are changing the way that people are talking about this is changing but in terms of modeling it in terms of understanding it the only way to really understand it is looking at it from a mathematical perspective and so from a mathematical perspective you say okay what does the Advent of chat GPT and Claude and perplexity mathematically what does this do to individual interactions individual relationships my like for instance my relationship to um you know the rest of the world your relationship to me your relationships with each other your relationship to your government your relationship to other governments and so and I don't have the answer for this because this is kind of a new area of interest for for myself and I'm talking to people um but it all comes down to relationships and incentives and an example as to why it's kind of difficult to predict this going back to the complex uh adaptive system aspect is that uh the it was not obvious what the internet would would invent the internet was built to carry data right you know you you go back and even look at Bill Gates talking about internet in the early days it's like it's going to you know accelerate business which that was correct um you know but all he could imagine was that it would be good for email right but then as the internet got better and better it's it became good for Commerce and Retail and then it became good for social commentary and entertainment and literally everything else that the internet has become good for now and as the internet got bigger as the internet became a more powerful system with its own intrinsic or emergent desires um it has captured more and more of our attention more and more of our money um it's even captured my career and is making me wear a Star Trek outfit on the internet because 70% of you uh in the audience really like this um so and this is this is me being influenced by this digital super organism Okay so so that was that was quite a tangent but what I want to do is I want to get back to kind of like what are these new paradigms that are coming again it's you know uh rapid iterations short Cycles but sort of slow takeoff I wouldn't necessarily characterize it as slow takeoff because the the net ability of AI is more than doubling every six months um and so that's an exponential takeoff granted if the if the iteration cycle is 3 to 6 months right now um then it's going to be you know 1 to 3 months next year and then several weeks you know then year after that so it's really looking like 2025 2026 is when things really kind of ramp up quickly um not that it's ramping up quickly right right now but I think you get the idea so there's a few other books that I've been reading to try and really get an understanding of what's coming so one this was recommended um to me several times actually so the listening Society I will caution that the opening the introduction in the first chapter is a what I will say is a little bit cringey um cuz the author really seems to be super super full of himself and I think that there's probably cultural reasons for that but once you get into the meat of the book it's actually it's actually pretty interesting um when he's talking about kind of the social paradigms and he has a really really good way of articulating the different tribes that we see today like the conservatives and the nationalists versus the yoga instructors and the hippies and like he just has a really really um kind of light-hearted and humorous way of poking fun at literally everyone but he but not only just characterizing the social groups that are out there why they exist what forces are driving those social groups um so this is a very insightful book as to how Society is evolving um another one is that I'm still in the middle of is abundance by Peter diamandis so this one uh talks a lot about um kind of those those those emotional intuitive failures amongst many many other things but again it takes a very it takes a very like numbers based a math based because again if you can't trust your emotions if you can't trust your intuition you need math and you need data in order to understand what's happening and then I finally just got my copy of a deep Utopia I haven't uh cracked into this yet um but Liv borry has an interview with Nick Bostrom about this and so this is where I'm at this is I'm trying to say okay the Paradigm shifts are compressing um so what does that mean and like I said it's going to be pretty difficult to anticipate what the next paradigms are now of course people like curtz file and others um they have a good track record of of more or less accurately predicting some aspects of the Paradigm shifts um but it we do from here on out we have to take a very data and model and uh numbers oriented uh understanding of what is happening and what is coming and why um so those are some books that I would recommend uh to understand what's happening and then the final two are um so I mentioned a while back that I was reading basic economics which um so what I will say is that Thomas soul is considered like a fringe conservative quack by some people um and considered like Jesus by others and then the counter narrative is capital by Thomas  so this actually came from from you guys uh in the audience some some of you folks recommended this and I will say that Thomas is like the opposite like he's like left-wing Fringe and so um reading both of those to get a to get a good cross-section of like modern economic theory and where different people are coming from really helpful for understanding post- labor economics as well as the listening Society um to understand like okay how how will economics change and how will human Humanity change I'm still in the middle of working on it so I apologize that I don't have you know the answer to say like hey this is what's happening next um but I hope that that uh it's it's starting to become a little bit more clear where we're at and where we're going um yeah so back to work for me to understand all of this that's going on um another couple pieces of of news my novel is almost done um I'm doing a proof reading pass now um it's formatted it looks really good I've got the cover art um so that's coming and then also post nihilism I know that a lot of you people have been looking forward to when I get this book so because of recent conversations I've had uh I think that post nihilism is um at least all the content is on the page I'm going to need to give it a few passes to make sure that it's cleaned up but after more than two years of working on post nihilism I think the model is complete I think the book is complete um now it's just a matter of cleaning it up and packaging up packaging it so that it is presentable um yeah that's what I've been up to so thanks for watching sorry for the delay um but I have been hard at work um even if I haven't been as available and as present as I would like to be um but yeah that was that was all just because I sense that paradigm shift and now I'm understanding I've got a better model for what those Paradigm shifts represent why they're happening and what to anticipate at least in the short term so thanks for watching cheers have a good one",
