  "transcript": "AI has completely changed the game for web scraping so in this video I'll show you how you can use the latest AI techniques to efficiently scrape data including the latest Vision AI model which in my view is actually a total Game Changer this video is an absolute must-watch if you do any kind of web scraping in the age of AI in which we're living right now so let's say we have some kind of travel website we're going to scrape some travel data we have some options here we have let's see five options and we are currently on page one and so this is a very common type of website and maybe we want to get all the nightly rate and the ratings and the title of each place here by the way I generated these images with AI as well look how good they are I I'm really amazed at how good all of this is working these days look how beautiful this is so all of these images are actually generated with AI as well but let's say we want to get the title price and rating of each of these items so the easiest way is actually to just rightclick few page Source just copy all the HTML and just go to chat GPT and just dump it in here maybe have like a short message here's the HTML of some web page and then I'm just going to dump it right here and then I'll say uh give me the title nightly rate and rating of each item and let's see how it does all right so it's going to generate here after a couple seconds it's finished generating response let's see how it did so the first one $150 is 100% correct 44.9 $200 4.5 let's double check $200 4.5 yeah so this is the easiest way of doing it now another thing that they help with is the format if I wanted in Json format or as a CSV file it's it's capable of doing that as well so you let's try it in Json format here all right so here it's finishing the response we got it all in nice Json format so you can see how good they are I don't even have to go into the HTML and be like hey this is the HTML element that you need to get the title and then this one for the price you can just dump in the entire HTML structure and it can ract exactly what you want so doing it manually copying all the HTML and dumping it in chat GPT is one way of doing it now of course open AI the company behind it also offers you an API so you can programmatically do this which is probably what we want to do because if you want to collect a lot of data it's not efficient to do it manually so we want to do it programmatically so let's say I have a Javascript file here I know a lot of you are going to be coming from a python background but my channel is Javascript so we're going to take a look at some JavaScript code here so let's say we have some function here it's going to be Asing cuz we're going to do a bunch of await and after that we're actually going to call it right so all of the logic is going to be in this function here so let's try doing the exact same but just programmatically by using the open AI API and to use that API we do need to instantiated here so we do need to install the open AI package as well which I already did so I can just import that right here I actually already added my API key in a EnV file we do need to load that in the file here though so I can use the EMV package which will load up all of the variables from myv file so now we have the open AI variable here which we can then use to access its various apis so one of those apis is the chat completion that's actually the most common one so we want to create a new chat here so we can say messages we can have a lot of things here actually a history of messages we can specify uh some kind of system role I find actually not necessary you can keep it pretty basic it will produce good result so here we can say this is a user message so we can just pass along the same message as what we did in jet GPT so here we can say something like here is the HTML actually I'll make it a template literal so we can easily use a variable in here here is the HTML of some travel website now we don't actually have the HTML here yet so we need to actually use Puppeteer or something like that to get the actual HTML we'll do that in a second we still need to get the HTML from that website right so we're going to get it here's the HTML travel website give me the title nightly rate and the rating of each item in let's say Json format right so this will give us some response all right so this is how we can programmatically hook into open AIS models now we do need to get the HTML in the first place so how do we get the HTML of this page how do we get that programmatically well you could make a simple fetch call with Just note fetch or whatever fetching Library you have in your programming language but usually we do want to get a little bit fancier like taking a screenshot or clicking on certain elements so we'll use Puppeteer here now one of the problems you're going to run into is is that when you make requests to a website which is what we're going to do here is you're going to get blocked and so these websites often have Protections in place and they will restrict you do do things like rate limiting so what we're going to do is we're not going to directly make a network request ourselves we're going to do it through a proxy and we're going to use bright data for that they have a scraping browser product which we can use with Puppeteer to deal with those restrictions that you inevitably are going to run into so I actually did another video with bright data some time ago in which we did some e-commerce web scraping so check out that video as well so once you log into the dashboard and created your proxy cuz we're going to make a request through bright data they will give you your information down here I don't want to show it cuz it's it's my username and password but that's all you need it's super easy to set up so that's one part now the other part is we want to get the HTML with Puppeteer now to make this work with bright data I'm going to use Puppeteer core so what I'm going to install here is actually Puppeteer Dash core this will not install a complete chromium version but only the core functionality let me install this all right so now we have Puppeteer now we also have bright data so now we actually want to get the HTML so what we can do is simply use Puppeteer here make sure you import it from Puppeteer core and here we need to connect with that proxy that bright data gives us because then the request will go through bright data which helps with those restrictions so we say browser WS endpoint and it's WSS and let me actually make this a template literal because here you need to add your username and password and that's actually all the setup that you need I actually put that in an environment variable which I called bright data off this is myv file and the way that looks is just username colon password you put your username there and the password there and that's all you need to make sure that the requests go through bright data now here we do need to add something else which is the host here actually so here this host I will and just paste that so this is all we need to get connected to Bright data and now it's just business as usual with Puppeteer here so we have a browser here now we can open up a page now I also like to set the viewboard Because by default uh Puppeteer sets the viewport pretty small I like to make it more like a desktop now actually it suggests these for me actually that's fine with me so this is essentially all just set up here now we actually want to go to the page go to the Target website then we can get the HTML so we can say page. go to now where do we want to go to so in this example I actually spun up a simple website here on Heroku so I'm just going to copy this and I will actually put this in a separate variable here Target URL and I paste that right there now I can copy this variable and that's where we want to go to right so I will replace that with this all right now with Puppeteer now when we arrive at that page we don't immediately want to get the HTML because there could be some JavaScript there could be other things still affecting the HTML so we want to wait a little bit so here we can specify some options so wait until Dom content loaded there are other options as well like Network Idol and then some number zero seems to be popular here and what you may also want to do is just have a plain second or so of just waiting so in JavaScript what you can do is you can just create a new promise and wait and resolve that after let's say 1 second all right so you don't need to know JavaScript this is just a way of sleeping in JavaScript for a second all right so then here we can actually collect the data that we want right so we want the actual HTML and that is very easy to do with Puppeteer as well we can do page. content it will give us the complete HTML once we get the HTML we want to give that to open Ai and just like what we did manually before here's all the HTML give me the data now we're doing it programmatically now before we do that I highly recommend that you actually just log and see what you get for the HTML because remember you're paying for whatever you're passing to open AI we'll talk more about pricing as well but you do want to make sure that you're not you know passing too much especially here with just raw HTML I find that often you actually you have a lot of text in the HTML that you don't need so let me actually run this script so I'm going to say not scraper JS right so we're just logging the HTML to see what we get all right so we got a warning here we can ignore that all right so after a couple seconds I get all the HTML here you can see Florentine Hills Resort that is indeed what we have here on the page as well so let's actually see this is what we're all going to pass to open AI right right now you can see here above the body we also have a bunch of styles so there are styling here and let's see and then here even more right so here we have even more styling you can see there's actually a lot of things going on here and if you don't change this this is what you would pass to open AI right which costs a lot of tokens you're going to pay a lot for this so typically you do want to do a little bit of processing here before you actually pass it off to open AI one simple thing we can do is only continue with whatever is in the body we don't want to have all that styling we only want to continue here with whatever is in the body now my co-pilot should actually be able to help me out pretty well with this so let's see if it can pick up on what I want to do here all right so here it can evaluate this within the context of the page so it will run in the Dom of that page and it will give me the inner HTML of the body and that actually should work so I'm going to lck this one more time and now we don't even need this one because it can do it directly here on the page itself so I'm going to run this one more time let's see what we get all right so here I get my HTML again and let's see if that other stuff has been removed now you can see it's much shorter right so this is a simple way of just cleaning things up a little bit we actually don't even need this line anymore actually let me just change this because this is how we're collecting the data and we also want to close the browser because you can see here my terminal here is not finished yet right so here we do want to make sure that we close the browser and then after that we can make the actual call to open AI we don't need to browser for that this is just for collecting the data now we can pass it off to open AI for analysis so let's actually make this work so I'm going to say open AI give me the title nightly rate and rating now it expects the HTML here so let's actually rename this to HTML right so this is the HTML that we want to have some analysis on and that's what we're passing to openai open will give us a response it will actually give a lot of information I like to log the entire response and I will add the number one to that because it giv some other information as well like how many tokens you used and other things as well so I like to lock the entire thing and the ual data that you're actually interested in so like the the response to your chat message is typically quite nested yeah so here you can see my copilot helps me out response. data choices. message. content so this is typically the actual data so let's actually log both and see what we get I'm going to clear my terminal and and then I'm going to run this script widen it a little bit okay so we actually got a problem here which says You must provide a model of course yeah so here I didn't specify the model that we want to use so let's use the latest one at time of recording that's actually let's see GPT for Turbo prevum let me clear this and try this again it may actually take some time but you can see now we have an issue here U I'm probably not using the correct format here but at least we we are logging the complete response here so for number one yeah so here it will give us some information so the amount of tokens we used these are what we gave to the model so prompt tokens and also how many tokens we got back so how many so how big the response was you pay for both actually also of Interest usually is the Finish reason so stop is actually usually a good sign if there's a problem usually it has a different finish reason so here it probably should not be data in here so I should just make this response do choices take the first one do message and then there is some content in there so I'm going to clear this one more time and then let's get the data one more time all right so after a couple seconds I get this result let's take a look the first part here is the complete response but now we are correctly logging the data that we're actually interested in and it gave us the following so FIS Palace suet 1504 .9 F p4.9 so that looks all right right Florentine 200 Florentine 2004.5 yeah so so now we can programmatically scrape the data through a proxy so we don't get blocked and then programmatically pass it off to open AI to get some analysis on that so this is already much more scalable than doing it the manual way or getting blocked all the time now one downside is that you do need to make a call to open AI each time we can prevent that by just taking the HTML that we get and just doing that analysis ourselves so instead of making a call to open AI here is maybe where we would have our own analysis code and we can actually ask Chad GPT for that as well so I'm going to copy that HTML actually and then I'm going to here's the body HTML of some page I'm scraping I'm going to dump that HTML in there write some code to get me the title nightly rate and the rating of each item in Json format so let's see what it can do with that so it's going to do some analysis here all right so here it's going to go with the response so it says something about extracted on information now it gives me the actual Json uh data which is not what we want no give me the actual code to get that information okay so it gives me it in Python no give me this in JS so here it gives me a suggestion you can put your HTML in some variable and then here it's going to run some write some actual code to actually extract that information so here you can see it can already pick up where you can find the title nightly rate and rating right so in the past you had to dig down into the HTML and then here is the H2 that's what we want to use right because these llms are really good at text and analysis and that is ultimately what code is it's just a bunch of text so it's very good at extracting the exact information that we want so this is the code that we want to run on that HTML right so you can run this code instead of making that call to open AI right so you could save money that way now there are some issues with this approach as well which is that if the HTML is a little bit complex you often do need to go into the HTML and specify which tags to use and often those bigger websites will actually deliberately change the HTML structure so that so that you can properly scrape it so every time they change the HTML you would have to update this code as well another problem is that if you do it this text way because we're just getting the information from text essentially the problem with this will be that if you have let's say a website that has some kind of strike through and then a discount price maybe this 150 is a strike through and there's like $90 next to it now in the HTML it may not be clear that this $150 has a strike through right that's just CSS the line through there is just CSS so any HTML that may be detectable and so if you do it this text based way it may still think that the nightly rate is just this $150 let same so those are the downsides of text based scraping and extracting the data based on the text so let's actually take a look at the vision API that open AI also offers us so it's GPT for vision and they give some examples here but let's actually take a look at our codes to see what we need to change in order to get the same results based on the vision API and we're also going to take a look at which one is going to be cheaper the tech text based way or the vision API so here we were getting the HTML and then passing that to open AI That's the text based way you could say now what we want to do is we want to take a screenshot and we want to pass along that screenshot to open AI so I'm going to remove this we don't want to collect HTML anymore we want to take a screenshot very easy to do works with bright data scraping browser here as well no problem we can take a screenshot here and here we can specify the path under which it's going to save it here in my file system now the important thing to note here is that the extension that you use will determine what type of file it's going to be so here it's going to be a PNG file which has the highest quality because it's lossless there's but it also comes at an additional price because remember we're going to pass this to open AI in a second and based on how large the image is you're going to have to pay basically your prompt token so instead you may want to use a jpack which is slightly lower quality but you save a lot in size and another thing is we do want to grab the entire page so by default it will only grab it whatever is in the view Port so then it would only grab this part here but we want to have the entire page let's see what happens now and let's let me comment out this entire open Ai call because we're going to change that so I'm going to comment this out for now so we're just going to see if we can get a screenshot here so here we should see a screenshot pop up I'm going to run this script let's see all right so here we got an issue here because we're still using the response variable but and that's what we just commented out but we do get a screenshot here and this looks perfectly fine so now this screenshot is what we're going to pass to open AI so open AI should you should be able to see that there is $150 here in the text there is some rating here a title let's see if it can actually properly extract that from the image so let me comment this back in again so here we now have a screenshot we close the browser and now we want to pass off the screenshot to open AI so how does the API change here well not much at all actually it's still going to be this chat completions but the model is going to be GPT 4 Vision preview and you're still working with messages so let me replace this with what it should be so I just replaced this with what it should be for the GPT Vision model so here it's still going to be Ro user and then we have an array of content here so we tell open AI give me the title nightly rate and the rating of each item in Jon format at the exact same as before but now we're not passing along the HTML as you can see here now the second object is going to be the image that we can pass along so here the type actually needs to be image URL and then here we have image URL which is another object here and then we have the actual URL to the image now you may think actually co-pilot thought it was going to be yeah it was going to be something like this now this doesn't work you can only pass in a URL like that if it's a Public Image so maybe you have uploaded this somewhere you you can just give open a URL of that now here we have a local image it's part of my file system here on my local computer so in that case we cannot pass a URL like that we need to do it in base 64 encoded format and actually it's very easy to do with Puppeteer we can actually just specify the encoding here to be base 64 and that's what you get as a result here so we can just call it base 64 image or image base 64 so now this will hold basically a string which represents the image that's what we pass along now under URL here still and actually it needs to be in a specific format here so we can actually yeah you copilot actually helps me out here so it's going to be data image jpack and then it's going to be the base 64 string like this all right so this is basically it all right so now we are passing along this image let's actually see if it can give us what we want so I'm going to clear this I'm going to run this one more time let's take a look all right so after sometime let make a little bit wider we get a result and this result looks very similar to what we got before that's a good sign here we also get some information about how many tokens it used we can compare this with how much it cost previously when we were just passing the HTML in seconds but here we are getting the data that we want right so Fen is 150 4.9 Fen is 150 4.9 so that all looks good we get we seem to get correct result here and so this approach is maybe what you want to go for especially if you have complex HTML structure but the text based way may not work properly or you have a lot of fancy CSS that may not be picked up by the text based approach so we're also going to take a look at what is cheaper maybe this is actually cheaper than the text based approach right all working still with bright data proxy here right so we're still always making the initial request to this page here through bright data so we don't get blocked and then here we can still take a screenshot that still works as well all of that is still working as well you also may want to add the max tokens option here so by default it's actually pretty low so you may actually get a result where it says something about uh that it doesn't have enough space to Output the result and in that case the Finish reason will actually be something else so that's why you want to take a look at the Finish reason if you run into that you may actually want to increase the amount of tokens right so they give 300 in one of their examples now we don't need that for this case so here let's take a look we for this image here that we were passing this resulted in 1128 tokens as an input now they give you a way of changing this or at least playing around with this so they give you the detail option here so you can actually also set it to low and what it will do is it will take your incoming image it will resize it to make lower resolution and then it will pass it to the model which should dramatically decrease your amount of tokens actually so let's actually take a look so here 1128 let's remember that I'm going to run this again all right so here I get a result again and now let's take a look how many tokens we used we used 108 tokens remember previously it was 1128 so this is a dramatic decrease but let's actually see if it did it properly so Venice $219 per night no that's not correct that's so we have fenis it should be 150 and the rating is 4.9 that's correct but you can see here it starts to make mistakes right so this is something you want to play with depends a bit on how this is actually much cheaper and actually on the pricing page here you can play around with this so here Vision price calculator you can see if the image that you pass to the model becomes bigger the price increases here right now if you make it low resolution it will be a fixed low resolution so no matter how big the initial image is that you pass to open AI it will be a fixed price here as this calculator is showing it will increase the likelihood of Mistakes by default it's actually set to aut Auto I believe so open a will actually take a look at your image and will decide for you what the resolution should be right so maybe this is not something you want to use right so just the standard setting gave us correct result but it it cost us something like 1128 in tokens if we compare that with the text approach I'm going to contrl Z back to our text based approach so we can take a look at those at that amount of tokens so we don't need a screenshot here all right so here I control Z all the way back to the text based approach so now it's going to be based on the HTML that we passed to open AI now we did do some clean up of the HTML before we passed it right so if you just pass along the entire HTML how much would that cost us let's take a look right so this is going to be the cost giving the complete HTML to open AI all right so then here we get a response and actually we still have the same mistake where this should of course be without data but that doesn't matter because we're interested in the tokens you can see this is much more remember with just the image we had something like 1,00 here it's 90,000 to tokens because I'm passing along the entire HTML which could have a lot of things in there that we're simply not interested in I think I probably lose a couple dollars on just this one request right now so hopefully you're enjoying the video and so for the text based approach I think it's really important that you clean up the HTML before you do anything else with it cuz it can have so many things that you're not interested in which will affect everything else Downstream right so let me just do it with the cleaner HTML let's see what result we get all right so here I get a result let's see how many tokens this cost cost me here I'm actually only paying about 600 tokens so this would be a bit cheaper than the vision right now but it's also because it's simply a very small page right so this is a very simple page there's not that much HTML if you just look at the body tag now I did some other tests and actually most most of the time actually the vision API will actually be cheaper because in the real world the HTML is going to be more complex definitely make that comparison yourself to see how much you can save so one more thing about the vision API I just so this Vision API is interesting because you can also ask for other things like clickable elements give me the coordinates of all clickable elements on this page so let's actually see what it gives us because if it can give us the coordinates of buttons and links we can use those coordinates to instruct Puppeteer to click on them which means we can easily do pagination but also if you have like a popup it can identify the like a cross and then maybe it can click that button to close the popup all right so here what we get is let's take a look so here I'm sorry but I can provide coordinates right so it's not able to do that right now now my guess is that this is going to rapidly improve in the next few months open AI seems to really be focusing on images and videos right now so it should be able to detect that at the bottom here we have a set of buttons here for example I think that should be pretty easy to identify so that's something that I think is going to become quite powerful as well and so with all of these AI tools and now also with bright data scraping browser you have a very powerful web scraping setup this is how I would do web scraping this is a very convenient scalable way of doing web scraping right now now I'm using puppeteers so that's why we're using scraping browser they have an even simpler solution here called Web unlocker in case you're just doing Simple fetch calls yourself without Puppeteer it works very similarly so you just connect to their proxy and you pass along your username and password so I want to thank Bri data for sponsoring this video and I hope that this was helpful for your web scraping Endeavor thanks for watching this video and I hope to see you next one bye",
