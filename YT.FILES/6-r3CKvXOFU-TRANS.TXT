  "transcript": "recording in progress hello okay and we should get people I guess I'm still a little bit early yep all right we got people streaming in right on time let's go all right and then we come over to the community tab [Music] um also the webinar is starting all right let's see oh right I need to make sure that everyone can chat everyone can chat with everyone hello where is everyone coming from youer we're still about five minutes early we got Houston Poland happy Friday evening Poland I hope there are no Russian missiles flying overhead New Delhi oh wow it must be late over in in India what time is it I think we're about what like nine hours difference well thanks for staying up late I hope you get some sleep after this enjoy the weekend ah and so for anyone that's new Jennifer or Luca Luca neifer from Germany sorry my brain tried to say all of those words at [Laughter] once um but yeah so for for folks that are new the way that this works is we've got the I've got a short presentation just like my typical slide deck thing and then we'll switch to the Q&A format I've got a whole like tutorial um in the in the presentation just so that everyone is kind of on the same page but everyone is of course welcome to uh chat in the chat while I'm talking or while answering questions um yeah and usually we get started about five minutes after just because people are streaming in um but it seems like people are streaming in a little little faster than normal which is not surprising because I I opened it up to um uh YouTube and patreon and substack so yeah so everyone is aggregating here that was a good question I'll go ahead and answer that um I went to the gym yesterday because I wasn't feeling good um I was I had like bad dreams and then there were something like not not really a con confrontation just a mild disappointment disappointing conversation so I was like I need to work it out so yesterday was gym but today I I mean I did go to the gym today but um it was just for uh breathing and yoga and posture work good question thank you actually where's my Let's see we got we got our resident Borg Queen we got Strite we got Dylan we got Eric maren good to see everybody Baston I've never been up to Boston is it is it as Irish as the movies make it out to be like is everybody there just Irish or Italian it's even more okay so they have to they have to downplay it a little bit in the movies that's great what kind of uh I assume you mean martial arts not marital Arts although I've done both um no um I did it's been many years but I did the the two big ones were um were hop Kido and Taekwondo um and I did a little bit of Tai boxing it wasn't full on Muay Thai it was just tie boxing um but not nearly as much I'm not I never got into striking um I was I love grappling and ground fighting in fact that was actually one of the first things that like my wife my now wife and I did when we were started hanging out was she's a second degree black belt um but I have 60 pounds on her so it's not a fair fight Dublin isn't as Irish as Boston oh that's a good one um let's see and then our resident boor Queen the connection between histamine and food yep yep yeah so if you if you have persistent stuffy nose then you you might have histamine intolerance that's not a diagnosis just something to look into um yeah yeah Tai boing Tai boxing and jiujitsu um that sounds like a lot of fun I if I ever if I'm ever youthful again I might get back into it like God that's one thing I really want is like when we have a hollow deck like I want to be like you know give me a level one Taekwondo sparring partner and then like I want to work up to like just fighting Klingons my wife says that I have the personality of a Klingon um all right KLA yeah exactly um all right we're at 20 people it's right on the hour so we'll wait another few minutes people usually start streaming in right about now and then we'll get started um but everyone is welcome to just keep hanging and hanging out and chatting in the the chat window for now um let's see why is the attendees list up I don't need that um there we go but yeah so where's everyone all the all the new folks that are streaming in where you where you coming from either physically or digitally did you come from patreon YouTube or substack that can be a pop quiz question or you can just talk about like your hometown we're trying to figure out which was which was more Irish was okay we got Seattle Portland yep West Coast folks Philly Michigan hey Michigan is it what's the weather like because I know like I had I dated a girl once for a while who was from Michigan and she would always talk about lake effect snow she was a trip it's 42 oh yeah it's colder than it is here Poland yep had snow Yeah there's there's a YouTuber that I watch who's presently like on the far north like in Lapland of Finland and it's just like still like frozen hell oh we got we got Finland yep Montreal I want to take my wife to Montreal I was there in the summer so this was many many years ago we went we went to Montreal in the summer I don't even know why I think my dad just wanted to go traveling and like it was like perfect perfect weather for us Southerners it was sunny and clear and Breezy and just a little bit warm and the waiter like we were sitting at an outside Cafe in the waiter and maybe it's just a Canadian like politeness thing he's like oh sorry the weather is so awful and we're like what are you talking about are you drunk this weather is perfect but like we're from North Carolina where it's like subtropical so as long as it's not sweltering like like we're happy yeah 38 degrees that's a little little too cold Buffalo you get some Lake Effects no my stepdad was from Buffalo that's like that's like the New York that people forget exists Sweden very nice I want to visit Sweden someday couple couple YouTubers that I watch are from Sweden [Laughter] yanic you said you're in Montreal okay yeah so you got you got some serious snow up there do you like the summers in Montreal also one interesting life experience the first time that I saw a p PDA public display of affection between women like in in public was in Montreal we were like at a at a like city park and there was like a couple of lesbians like not quite making out but it was just like I was just like hm my high school brain couldn't quite process that because again North Carolina Bible Belt were very conservative down here not me I'm I'm a heathen all right we'll get started in just another minute or two I see people are still continuing to stream in um yeah so actually some one of one of my one of my actually the the woman who introduced me to like the poly and kink and sex positive crowd she actually moved out to I think she's in Port Portland OR Seattle she's in the Pacific Northwest um much much better fits her her personality than the Bible Belt down here okay but I asked her what's it called it's like the the the Pacific like the the the the freeze or whatever like people are just super introverted and not friendly is that true out there in the Pacific Northwest yeah maybe it wasn't Portland that she's in okay yeah interesting or I wonder I wonder if it's changed because yeah we stay indoors because it's cold and wet yeah that's fair that's fair that I think that's honestly the the thing that I couldn't handle the the most being in the Pacific Northwest was because like I need outside time like on days that it's cold and dreary I just like shut down and I'm immediately depressed and then if the sun comes I'm like solar powerered I'm solar powered so if if there's no sun I just shut down yeah yeah yeah no like I would remember so it just saying that it's really green out there so when I was traveling through rural France I was like this looks like North Carolina it's so green um so I know why Andre the Giant when he expatriated from France he actually settled in rural North Carolina he uh he had a horse farm down here all right it is five after so we will go ahead and get started so thank you everyone for jumping in hello welcome um the way that this works and let me go ahead and just bring up the uh let me go ahead and bring up the presentation so the way that this works is um I have a short uh just normal slide deck to go through kind of um kind of prime the pump for conversation and in the meantime you can be using the Q&A button um let me get this slideshow started and then we can share screen you can use the uh you can use the the Q&A button so you can go ahead and uh spool up your questions as you're as you think of them and once you have uh your question up you can upload uh uh the other people's questions that you want to see and so if you're on if you're on desktop it's down here it's going to be beside the chat button so just go into the Q&A and you can ask your questions and if you're really shy you don't have to ask them publicly you can I'm not sure how but because I've I've only been on my side but you can submit a question anonymously because people do have stage fright and that's fine fine uh one one poor guy I called him up and he like completely froze up a couple episodes back and I felt really bad so if you're if you're shy you can ask a question anonymously otherwise I can um once if if your question gets upvoted I'll take them in the order that they are asked and it'll basically be like a short conversation um just like a quick back and forth like you can ask your question you know so on and so forth um we usually get through like I don't know maybe a dozen or so questions um last time there was like 40 questions and so um it's really important to upvote the ones that you want answered um and and so then you know everyone will kind of get a good cross-section of what they want to see excuse me so without further Ado today's episode is future of humanity um and I picked the image of all the Borg Queens just because I thought it was hilarious I don't know who made this um but it was uh pretty pretty well done um so future of humanity we're talking about stuff like uh cybernetics because you know we had we just saw the first neuralink patient um and then there's also been some a little bit of noise on the longevity front you know Rejuvenation therapies and that sort of thing there's also been some controversies um but with the rate of accelerating change I figured today would be a good time to start talking about transhumanism post-humanism uh transgenic uh you know like what is the future of human evolution so uh as promised the slide presentation it's just a few slides um and basically the this is just to kind of start the conversation now we did have the first guy get uh get the neurolink successfully installed seems like a happy guy I think after like the first night or you first night home he like spent all night playing Civ which is like man it just that that kind of really drove it home to me and I know that there the pr folks are like you know cranking away over there um but the the idea that this technology can help people with disabilities that there could be not not just a you know let's enhance ourselves and make sure that we're useful to the AI or increase the io bandwidth between humans and machines so that you know the AGI keeps us around so that we can be useful co-processors I don't really buy that as an idea um I mean yes there it is logically consistent but I don't necessarily think it's a good idea um at the same time this is kind of proof positive um and I don't know for for people who remember when SpaceX SpaceX kept blowing up FAL NES and they just kept blowing up and then they started to stick the landing and then they started selling contracts I remember even just as recently as a few years ago people saying SpaceX is never gonna work you know blah blah blah Elon Musk has no idea what he's doing he's an idiot but then it worked and so then remember as recently as a year ago neuralink was still killing monkeys and pigs left and right um which of course they deny um but or they said that it was you know they died of other causes technicalities point is is that a bunch of animals died and everyone's like and you want to put this in humans but here we are the guy is as far as I know as of you know this morning still alive um so that is the that is the nature of Rapid iteration that Elon Musk is famous for so will It ultimately have the advantages that he says it will that you can have a high like gigabit IO port in your head I seriously doubt it um but you know in the long run who knows um kind of one of the things one of the technologies that I predict and it's I'm always in the lookout for it is like a neural polymer where basically you just shrink wrap the brain in a semiconductive um like polymer Matrix and that could be that could get you the bandwidth that you need um but individual electrodes in the brain no I don't think that's gonna I don't think that's going to fly but still very interesting um so now as we've been progressing you know people talk about like ship of thesis like can you augment the brain can you expand the brain and I was just reading um the age of spiritual machines by Ray Kurtz and he actually predicted a lot of stuff that happened some of it didn't happen quite as soon because I got to like the 2009 chapter and I'm like yeah you're a decade off for all of these things and then by the time I got to the 2019 chapter it was just like you know he's like we'll be using carbon nanot tubes for all computers by then I was like that never happened um but all the like Wireless stuff that he predicted that that all happened um right around the time that he predicted but so if we're connecting you know implants to human brains then you have this ability to control things your brain now has more peripherals and what does that mean but also the question is where is consciousness and so you could say well obviously it's in the brain but you know there's a there's a few things that can happen so for instance um you can have half your brain removed as as is sometimes done in the case of extreme um epilepsy where they split the Corpus kosum and just remove half your brain and it's like well that's kind of horrifying because maybe there was like another part of yourself that just died like that just gets scooped out of your head and that's like super like traumatizing um but then also you there's some fundamental questions and I've been running polls on my YouTube channel like you know what what constitutes sentience what constitutes Consciousness um is a Sim if you have a perfectly High Fidelity simulation does that count as sentience if it's electromechanical does that count as sentience and some people are like no it has to be biochemical and it's like well why and they're like I don't know that just intuitively Mak sense um but like from a from a purely physics standpoint then it is it like it could just be information now there's also like electrical brain waves there's electromagnetic aspects maybe Consciousness actually does require coherent patterns of brain waves in order to really emerge so therefore a CPU only if the CPU is using the right pattern um but you never know like we we we don't have ways of testing this yet but what I will say is that as we have more peripherals extending our brains we might figure this out because and here's just a simple thought experiment imagine you know 10 years from now you've got neurolink version 8 or whatever and it's a high bandwidth thing and you plug it in and your your Consciousness expands right it feels like you just did a line of spice and you can perceive the entire universe and so you you feel as though yourself has expanded and then that a huge part of your software operating stack is in this machine and you can only feel that part of your Consciousness while you're connected what happens when you disconnect does your Consciousness contract does part of you like is it is it like dying and then of course if that part of you is still running over in the machine what happens when you plug back in is it like you know is it is it like in the game and for anyone who's not getting the reference I'll explain it in a second but is it is it like you know two personalities merging together again this is actually a theme in the fanfi I'm writing of cyberpunk 2077 um okay so this character is Keana Reeves AKA Johnny silverhand which is a character from The Cyber from the game cyberpunk 2077 and he's actually just a a personality Ingram that's loaded into your head and is slowly taking over your brain with nanites um so basically a 50-year dead terrorist is assimilating your brain slowly in this game it's lots of good fun um one of the key themes of the game is identity where does where does who you think you are uh end and who you're becoming where does that begin um and is there there any difference so um that is some of the things that come up with cyberization and that sort of stuff these are questions that we're going to have to answer sooner rather than later which is a really interesting place to be excuse me um I tried to find news on like the actual like news stuff for transgenic and life extension and that sort of stuff there isn't a whole lot of hard news um lately however the first uh crisper therapies have been approved in the US UK um I watched a video about them they're really really expensive and complicated to install um you basically have to go through the whole process of of um oh what's it called like when you have like leukemia and they have to completely destroy your immune system and replace it with a new one so it's a pretty traumatic thing it's not just like oh here's an injection and you've now been crisper uh it's it's much more severe than that um but the fact that they can do it and it's done with crisper is a step in that direction now looking at what is hypothetically Poss well just from a strictly chemical perspective versus where like we like where we're at today there is a huge huge gap and we've got a long ways to go and it's it's grounding to check in on that kind of stuff every now and then um and it's like man you know because we if we unlock more of this genetic medicine hopefully we'll have this kind of breakthrough I was actually talking to one of my doctors and um because one of the medicines that I'm on to manage a chronic condition is a monoclonal antibody which is similar to mRNA uh stuff but it's a little bit different and she said oh yeah like actually most of the new drugs coming out are monoclonal antibody stuff like wovi the one that's for like um weight loss so that's an entirely new class of drugs that can modify your body's operating system at a pretty fundamental level um so it's like we might not need Gene editing to get to like longevity escape velocity and Rejuvenation therapies we might have the fundamental technology already um but again it's an entirely new class of of medicines so it'll take a little while um so on specifically on the topic of Rejuvenation and Longevity specifically we H the good news is we have succeeded in actually de-aging mice now that is good because mice are complex mammals it's not so good because they often are not a good uh proxy for humans because we diverge far enough back that some of the same diseases and genes and medicines that work on mice just absolutely do not work on humans it's just like a whole different you know philogyny um and so but but I remember having an argument with someone on a forum probably 15 years ago saying the fact that some organisms do not age is proof that it is possible for some organisms to live forever and he said in no in no way does that translate that humans can live forever you're wrong and an idiot whatever you know people are toxic on the internet when you're in debates but the fact that we have taken an animal that had a natural lifespan and deaged it now actually one thing that I want to qualify this is I don't know if the maximum lifespan of the mice has changed but at least they have been deaged um so I did forget that that detail um but if we are able to extend to extend the lifespan and healthspan or Dage a complex mammal that is further evidence that it is hypothetically possible to do it on humans um so again feasibility so on so forth uh David Sinclair I looked at I looked him up so he's one of the big names he's had a little bit of controversy lately where there's more and more people pushing back against his research where some people are just straight out claiming that like he's pushing fraud like Flatout fraud um now of course no matter like once you get big enough you have critics like I have critics now and I'm not even that big so it's just like it happens people want to throw stones um if they're for whatever reason you know they might think that they're doing the right thing they might have a legitimate point I don't know um but there has been some controversy around David Sinclair now he did say that he like he expects to have some Rejuvenation pills coming out and getting tested in the next couple of years so who knows you know the proof will be in the pudding if the FDA approves a life extending drug or a Rejuvenation drug you know he'll be Vindicated and then Brian Johnson is this dude who is like the daging king um I actually finally listened to him on a podcast and um I agree with like he's he's really focusing on the AI stuff right now um really interesting guy uh I don't agree with a 100% of what he says or how he says it but a lot of the the structure the conversations that he wants to have um are really important and and one of those is he's really reconciling with the idea that okay we're creating something better than us what is that mean um so he has he's been on a few podcasts uh about that topic now so taking a big step back because this is the future of humanity webinar um we are at an existential inflection point and so what I mean by that is whatever is happening whatever is going to happen Life as we know it is ending now that doesn't mean like you know life is going to be eradicated or extincted excuse me but it's going to change and it's going to change drastically and I'm reading lots and lots of books from thinkers from you know economics to um well here we've got Nick Bostrom who's a philosopher Max TEEG Mars who's AI Ray Kurtz who's the you know longtime computer science dude Peter diamandis who's a macro I think he's macroeconomics I don't remember what his background is Ray doio who's a you know big hedge fund dude all of these guys are saying more or less the same thing and so when you have people from different disciplines all more or less saying the same thing that hey we're heading for a major inflection point and things are going to get really weird like it's not just me cuz again like there's people out there on the internet saying oh AGI is you know it's a nothing Burger blah blah blah and I'm like I don't know about that so that is kind of where we're at now so with all that being said um let's jump over to the Q&A part of the conversation I see we've got some questions up there already let me go ahead and stop the sharing um Diamond it's medical doctor an aerospace engineer oh thank you for that um he eats a lot of black lentils uh yeah so let's hop over to the questions so don't forget to um to jump over to the Q&A and ask your questions and also upvote the ones that you want to get answered um and then I need to sort by popularity did they change it is it not letting people upvote can you upvote questions interesting why is it not letting people upvote questions H hang on we have a technical glitch I wonder if I created the settings wrong oh here we go sorry about that all right I add it I I changed the right settings all right please go back to the Q&A and make sure you you you can you can now upvote questions and comment on them so I'll give people a minute to to uh take a look in their questions um but yeah so so that's that's where I'm at um I think you can still get to the Q&A on your phone if so if anyone else is on is on their phone or mobile I guess I guess if you're driving you should probably focus on driving um yep okay sorry about that folks all right yeah all right we've got we've got we've got some we've got some questions going so I'll go ahead and start answering while more questions roll in um let's see all right Anonymous attendee asks when do you anticipate longevity interventions becoming mainstream additionally how much do you think uh initial technological advancements will contribute to extending healthy lifespan um okay so to answer the first question when it becomes mainstream it's going to be similar to kind of the trickle of of other treatments so for instance like uh wovi is is is an example of a monoclonal antibody um uh medicine that is that is available another one that I'm on um is doesn't have nearly as dramatic of effect um but it is almost miraculous in that it's it's like hey here's this problem that was until now mostly untreatable unless you could tolerate another medication but now you just take this injection you know every other week and it's fine um and so once the proof is in the pudding you know you you look for the investment and so the trend that I pay attention to that I used to predict when solar was going to go mainstream and now that AI is mainstream is you look at the the the ramp up of funding and uh or investment or or whatever and so longevity Arch is kind of at the like the 2009 to 2010 level of solar so if you remember back then 2009 2010 was when people were talking about solar as like hey this is going to be a solution and all the like grumpy kogin are like no it's never you know it's not feasible blah blah blah and now guess who's who's building solar Farms is all those grumpy kudin um and but we're right at the beginning of the takeoff of that exponential growth because all of these things kind of follow a sigmoid curve and so the sigmoid curve it starts slow ramps up you get to the exponential part and then it starts to taper off and so solar is near the is past the exponential and it's actually to the point where solar is so cheap that it's almost no longer feasible like even China is complaining that solar is too cheap now and so AI is just about to hit maximum speed in terms of investment and then longevity and other stuff is a few years behind so if I had to guess I'm I would say probably 2030 is when we should see like that exponential like hey there there's longevity stuff all over the place now yeah so someone just said in the comments wovi is a trojan horse into longevity treatments it very well could be um I don't I don't know enough about how it works um and yes so someone says your timeline fits with Ray Kurtz yeah so like he was the first one that that because I was kind of thinking like okay because way back in like 2008 2009 I was looking at 2020 as kind of when regenerative medicine was going to take off and that was more more or less happen and there's there are some regenerative therapies but they're not necessarily widespread they're usually hyper hyperfocused like you know there's some regenerative therapies that are available for like burn victims or whatever but it's not for daging and part of that is because of the politics around de-aging um but yeah so 2030 I would expect it to be kind of not over andone with but that's when it'll start to get really exciting um yeah good question all right so that one was answered let me do a refresh me let's get you up I think you asked a question last time your name looks familiar Misha asks a question hello all right come on up you're muted oh sorry sorry oh hey hey so yeah thanks David um I wanted to ask about an marm Theon samman they're very they when they speak publicly they're they're usually quite against it I wonder your thoughts are on that things a lot yeah so quick question by anthropomorphism do you mean like giving humanlike characteristics to these machines or or like giving them physical humanlike forms do you mean like attributing yeah go ahead sorry yeah sorry um I know the term is a little bit strange what I mean is U like giving like treating them like humans in like chat Sam phys he said like in with Mir we didn't we purposely didn't give it a name we called it chat GPT for a reason right yeah yeah I gotta I gotta so yeah there's there's a few things going on and and and I can I can understand why they approached that that from that angle because and I Su I have a I have a bunch of thoughts so let me try and order them um so one is given what Sam Alman used to say about how AGI is going to transform the world you know very head in the clouds kind of kind of tech tech futurist like like you and me and and everyone here but he's had to temper that message as he has become more famous because he can't spook investors and so there's a very very big tension between what he wants to say and what he what he truly believes and what he's supposed to say what he needs to say in order to keep Microsoft happy and investors happy and it's becoming increasingly hard to know what he truly thinks and what he truly wants um however he has even before he started kind of getting the leash yanked on him he said it's not a creature it's not a creature so he seems to be coming from a more what I'm what I'm inferring as kind of a religious background which is humans are special and machines will never be anything like us and that's the end of the story so he has he has a he has precluded or a preconceived notion about the nature of intelligence and about the nature of life cuz he's not even like know you read life 3.0 Max Tech Mark there's plenty of scientists and philosophers who say yes this is a form of life and so when someone like Sam Altman says this is not a life form and it never will be that's just like intellectually disingenuous and but but here's the thing is I don't know if he actually believes that or if he's just saying it for the sake of investors because if you have you know the the new vunderkind the new you know Steve Jobs or whatever coming out saying like we're inventing a new life form and it's going to be a successor species all the investors going to be like yeah no we're not going to invest with you so the it's it's hard to say but the fact of the matter is is that everyone from what was it Eric Hinton um you know and and a bunch of others even some of the OG like deep deep uh learning researchers many of them believe that like okay it's possible that what we're what we're creating are actually conscious or actually sentient and so it will be an open question for a long time because this this is part of that inflection point that I was talking about that existential inflection point which is what are we creating and what does it mean about us whether whether or not it's better than us which you know it very well could become better than us or different it still calls into question a lot of assumptions about ourselves because if you come from you know one of the abrahamic religions where it's you know humans are special we're made in God's image and the universe is ours you know to do with what we want um someone says their question is too long to post in QA well try and try and and and slim it down um anyways if you come from that that philosophic that ontological you know tradition where you believe that humans are exceptional and humans are unique and always will be and that it is pre-ordained by you know some Cosmic entity well yeah like creating this level of technology is going to clash with us however you go back to ancient Greece where they had myths of you know Talos you know the the bronze figure that was breathed life into like we have been struggling with what does it mean to be human and alive and thinking since like the ages of antiquity so are we going to resolve that anytime soon I don't think so I honestly suspect that probably forever we will be debating about what what is the definition of life and whether or not machines constitute life or or or Consciousness or sentience even in a million years when you know well maybe not in a million years when we're all like something else entirely we might have it settled by then but it's not going to be settled anytime soon uh great question thanks for asking how's that how how does that I I don't know if I if I covered what you wanted to cover yeah absolutely thanks D and the um that reminded me of the video you did about Sam and his religion I can't remember exactly what that covered but that was very helpful if you do some more in the future like St quite interested in him and what and just like what what you have to say about him yeah yeah so I'm I'm in a learning phase right now where I'm just I've got a stack of books that I'm going through just because like I need to get more ideas because if I yeah so I will I definitely keep that in mind so thanks for that feedback all right let's see who's next all right we've got what do you expect the average life expectancy to be in 20 years oh that's a good one Anonymous asks um uh let's see yes so I I I post all the books that I'm that I'm reading on YouTube so just go to the community tab on YouTube and you'll see them pop up in the list um but Anonymous asked what do I expect the average life expect y to be in 20 years so I was actually asked on this this question on a French podcast what was the name of it it was like spark something anyways because I did a video on longevity and they asked me to go on their podcast and so we talked about longevity and I said here's here's the weird part the weirdest part about achieving longevity escape velocity or indefinite lifespan or whatever is that you're not going to notice it is because like unless you're already old and you get daging or if you're you know any where from you know middle-aged or younger where you've got 20 30 40 50 years of natural life expectancy left you're it's not going to impact your day-to-day life it's just like oh because for me I've got roughly probably 50 years of natural life expectancy left um all else being equal and so then if anytime in the next 10 to 20 years you know it's like oh your lifespan has is now 200 it's like well the runway just keeps getting longer faster than you're aging and so it within 20 years I expect that life expectancy is not really going to be a thing that we talk about as much anymore and I think that's going to start changing in the next five to 10 years where it's just like oh hey um we're going to live forever what next and this is actually something yeah the insurance companies will be sure to inform us that's a good good point um you know but and of course like on a long enough timeline all everyone's life expectancy drops to zero um you know you live long enough you'll survive to the Heat death of the Universe um someone asked do you really want to live forever and all all I could think of is that line from from Starship Troopers like you Apes want to live forever um so shout out to anyone who uh who remembers um Michael Ironside as a as a space Commando um anyways uh yeah so I think that I think that in 20 years it's going to be a non-issue except for people who are like on the cusp um Rico's Ru necks exactly so for for for most of the people here because I know that there are some some some older folks in the audience those are the people who are who it's really going to impact but like my nephew he's going to he's not even going to be like in his 20s before we hit like longevity escape velocity and so like for him his entire worldview will just be okay well I'm just going to keep living like this forever cool we'll see what happens and when you have that long to live like we've done all kinds of thought experiments both in science fiction and you know in vampire stories and those sorts of things there's all different kinds of ways that you can go with your life um but yeah so 20 20 years from now I think that we're going to be having a very very different conversation around life expectancy and and everything like that now will some people opt out I think absolutely I think that some people will just opt out for like hey just keep me healthy but not young and they'll want to die naturally and I think that that will definitely be be within the realm of possibility and I think that some people will probably just say you know what I want to see where it goes um I'm probably going to be in that camp um as long as long as my life continues to improve as it has then I'll be like yeah let's let's let's see it out let's see it through good question um all right oh and also folks um actually we have 20 Questions already um make sure you hop in and upvote any questions that you want to see um answered Anonymous also asks um what security concerns do we have with BCI and interfacing with public networks um St Stu there such as full dive VR in mind um I will say Watch Ghost in the Shell and play cyberpunk 2077 I will not be first in line to get a BCI just full stop um and and especially with the rise of quantum Computing if you get to a situation where where even the contents of your own mind and actually Philip over at AI explained had a video about this um where it's just like you know what was it called there was a paper that he read where it's like um like uh mental privacy might be a thing of the past and it's just like well what a time to be alive when this is getting getting published um so now also however though I could foresee a time where we in the future where we become so longlived and so empathetic And if quantum Computing does break cyber security which is possible um I've I've been trying to figure out like is it actually possible to break like uh cryp cryptography forever And if quantum Compu Computing can do what we think it can do or if qualia or qstar can do what we think it can do granted that was a fabricated leak but still the combination of quantum Computing and artificial intelligence might render digital privacy null and void and then if you live long enough and everyone becomes more empathetic and whatever I could imagine like a post- privacy future not saying that I want that it's certainly not today we're not ready for that but I could imagine a a post privacy future um at some point and I I still think it'll be opt in um as most things are uh so like if you want to if you don't ever want you know cybernetic enhancements that's fine um you know they'll you'll be running in in what they call autistic mode and and Ghost in the Shell so yep good question all right let me do a quick refresh to see who's up all right Luca let's get Luca up Luca has a question hello Luca you're muted there you go hello everybody um yeah I have yeah actually I have a few questions but I think I will start with my the question that I actually posted and it's about my master pieces so I'm currently at the beginning of my journey um I'm not really experienced in coding but I want to write my masterpieces about multi-agent systems especially large language models so I'm first of all I'm kind of sorry to crash the party with my nearsightedness kind of but uh yeah I'm kind of curious what um Frameworks you you could recommend maybe to me um so I I especially want to have great control over the conversation flows and so on I thought about um L chain not about Frameworks like crew Ai and such on because I think they you don't really get how the information is Flowing between the agents so you can't really control them in detail and then also I want to ask you how I could make sure that um yeah I I learned something for life kind of so something that I could apply in like three years and yeah that won't be yeah that's like relevant in the future as well I thought about communication patterns with L language because I'm like a strong believer um that maybe an AI will be like a multi-agent system at the beginning because yeah we could potentially control it more than our system um so yeah I just wanted to know your thoughts about that yeah so as far as Frameworks Go autogen is is a good a place as any to start um and I I I interviewed with Dr chiwang and he's a he's a great guy um and and I've talked to a couple other members of his team um and and I also have other friends at Microsoft who are working on similar things um that are secret enough that that they they can't tell me and they even tell me that they can't tell other people in Microsoft what they're working on um so there are there are some like you know black black site level projects going inside of Microsoft so autogen good enough place to start all the folks in Microsoft research at the high level they all talk to each other as far as I know um again there is some compartmentalization just because a corporate privacy um so I'm not really saying anything that that you couldn't uh infer but autogen is a good enough place to start uh now in terms of some of the universal patterns or principles what I will say from my work with um with my my um my like Raven architecture with the the ace framework um and and with the the aut the auto Forge team or agent Forge sorry the agent Forge team what we found universally was that throttling is Far and Away more important it's actually it's it's cuz getting agents to talk to each other that's the easy part and it's actually the the most important thing is unicasting so like having one agent talk directly to another or talk to a specific group and so that kind of signaling like traffic control is actually the most important part by far um because these these these underlying language models are already smart enough to do a lot of tasks but they have to be given a very the the right agent has to be given the right task and the right information and so and so you know less is more is kind of the universal pattern there now this has been well understood in Neuroscience for a long time so if you pick up like Neuroscience for dummies or um on task by David Bader which is another Neuroscience book um there's quite a few others but but like if you start with those two you'll see that uh that like some one one of the things that happens when the human brain breaks is that the brakes come off and so like an epileptic seizure is actually when the brain is too chatty when there's too much you know signals propagating across the brain because so the thing where where they say like oh you're only using 10% of your brain at any given time like it's difficult to to because if if you say that wrong people get angry you you are using most of your brain all the time however if you look at any given moment only about you know between one and 10% of your brain is firing at any given moment because if 100% of your brain is firing that's a grand M seizure um and so and so there's there's two fundamental forces in the human brain and that is excitation and inhibition inhibition or you know cognitive dampening or or clamping down on on signals is just as important as the excitation so if you focus on gating or or slamming on the brakes or whatever if you do your Master's thesis on on that kind of like restraint or inhibition I suspect you'll probably move the needle and be able to get a job at you know Google Microsoft or wherever else working on cognitive architecture or agent SWS thank you for the insights yeah yeah I hope that helps do you have any follow-up questions on that so like throttling is for as I understand it now it's like uh how the information is flowing and how I can switch off like parts of the agent framework so I can specialize it and how do I control which yeah which part of the framework is not is working yeah yeah so there would be a couple things so you you might have you might have you might not want to switch off the entire framework it might be about rate limiting so you say okay this agent is allowed to you know do a poll every one second or 20 seconds or whatever so you can have that as a scaler um is is uh is like so what am I trying to say it's a it's a matter of tuning right it's like an orchestra has to all play at the same time and so identifying the correct time sequence or time steps and knowing when each part of the orchestra is supposed to take a rest um now yes just flat out disabling parts of the of the agent framework that's that's what you can do like in an emergency like if it gets too chatty or too panicked or whatever but in the long like what you would really want to do is keep it in well timed well synchronized is this actually um part of the subject of my book Symphony of thought um which I wrote that before we had modern agent framework so it's not really going to be super relevant but did talk about timing as a big component of that so good question thank you thank you yeah all right let's see who's next um let's see do a quick refresh Ed Ed asks uh here let's bring Ed up Ed all right Ed you're up what what what you got you're muted can you hear me there we go hey yeah I just wanted to ask about so when you like the idea of you know an extended lifespan so maybe 200 or however many years how do you think marriages will be affected by that because I know even now that marriages people are getting divorced sooner and sooner how do you think people are going to stay together over a long period of time yeah so there's there's a few Trends already happening um one as you noted people are either they're putting off marriage or they're they're never getting married in in the first place um and and or marriages are shorter and people tend to be serial monogamists there's a lot of there's a lot of like relationship commentators out there that just say serial monogamy is actually the natural way of life and I don't actually know I don't fully agree with that but what I what I do agree with is that relationships change over your lifespan like as as you enter into a new phase of life you might need a new relationship and so some of like the masculinity reading that I'm doing I actually talk about how um how like uh what was the book I was reading I I don't remember which one it was I read a lot of books but basically saying that oh yeah it was the inner child workbook that like you're you you kind of go through a 13e cycle and so like every 13 years your life changes and so uh 39 which I'm approaching is like the next life cycle change and so that is like where you you uh like you typically see the guys go through like a midlife crisis and get a divorce and get in shape again and get a sports car and whatever um but some of that is it's not necessarily about um you know anything fundamental to our biology that like oh you're you're compelled to do this it's just you're entering into a new phase of life you might have more money you might have more time the kids are growing up and they're out of the out of the house and people also grow they grow together or they grow apart um so none of that I don't think is going to change uh with respect to kind of some of the relational patterns um one thing that that is still changing is the flexibility of society where particularly as women become more empowered and and there's less legal and financial reasons that they're dependent upon men that has greatly increased the flexibility and some people don't like that that's perfectly fine um but and as some people are saying in the comments like like yeah some people are perfectly happy like I'm married to my best friend I would not surprised if we're together a century from now or two centuries from now but also at the on the same token like I know that we both have different needs that we can't meet for each other and so I suspect that for many people once you get to a certain point like non- monogamy becomes more more commonplace of and all of its Myriad formats but again it's about flexibility and personal choice um so you might be able to have some macro Trends we'll probably see some stabilization like if I had to guess I would say probably just raw intuition probably 60% of the population is what I would say like naturally monogamous where it's just like that's their preferred State um and that's what they want they want a a lifelong friend a lifelong partner and they don't really want anything else and that's just intrinsic to their biology the other 40% are either going to be serial monogamous or non- monogamous or something like that and some people are will choose to be single for a long time um but again I I think that I think that the I think that the impact that longevity like long long lifespans will have on that will mostly just be that people have more time to figure stuff out um and I wouldn't be surprised if at at after a long time people kind of settle into a a pattern because even if you are you know youthful for 200 years most humans are creatures of habit and um you know you spend a few decades with someone that is a level of familiarity that's very very hard to replace so very interesting question do you have any follow-up parts of that well I guess I guess um how do you think it's going to change uh being the um Extended lifespan how do you think that's going to change our relationship with death because say say you have a best friend or even a wife if like uh how it is now if they died it's it's really sad but you know no matter what that was always going to happen but say say maybe like a hundred years from now that would be like very troubling cuz you know that that was just like a freak A accident they could have been with you for like another thousand years how do you think that's yeah how do you think that's going to change our relationship with death so there's a very poignant um uh like Mantra or idiom that I heard a few years ago and it's that uh all relationships end in tragedy um whether by death or divorce or estrangement or whatever and I think that on a long enough timeline it just you don't really think about it because I'm approaching 40 and it's like I've got enough of a Runway still ahead of me I don't really think about it and so as long as you've got more than 20 or 30 years ahead of you I don't think people really think about death that much um unless of course you have like trauma around death or like um there's a YouTuber that I follow sell who did DMT and she was like forced to confront death and so she had like PTSD from a DMT trip um but she worked through that um but I think that I think that most people if you're reasonably healthy you just don't think about it and I think that I think that you know whether you've been with someone for 5 years or 500 years I think that death is going to require the same grieving process um now what I will say is that uh kind of my intuition is telling me is that if let's say for instance you're with someone for 500 years and you know that you've got another 500 years after they die but you're going to be youthful and vigorous like you'll start another life um like you're not you're not going to just be grieving for another you know five centuries um now in some respects that could be really sad because you might feel like you're going to be like letting them down or forgetting about them they actually addressed that in briefly in the Mass Effect franchise where um the some of the races live a lot longer and so then they date you know they date down or whatever and it's like oh well I'm going to die and you're going to live you know hundreds of years after I'm gone and you're going to forget about me and it's like well maybe but this is the way that life goes um and I think that but again there some aspects of The Human Experience grief for instance is like that's that's Universal that's not going to change irrespective of how long you live um interesting question thanks yeah cheers all right let's see who's next and also oh wow it hasn't even been an hour yet all right Tanya I think I'm saying your name right Tanya let's get you up all right come on up what what you got hey good afternoon how's it going good good thanks for jumping in so um I worked my whole uh career in authenticity and intimacy and relationships and so I think about AGI and how it seems impossible not to teach it to lie because we humans lie for good reasons sometimes like white lies or saving someone's um you know ego or we use sarcasm I'm originally from New York and we speak in curses and sarcasm um so I just wonder what you think about that concept of of you know we should not teach it to lie yeah so I so I I posted a very like fiery thing on my YouTube channel a few months back just saying like you know any any company found deliberately training AI to lie like should get shut down immediately um I don't I well it I have I have tempered that opinion be and one of the reasons is because it occurred to me that the ability to lie very well could be an emergent quality um because here's here's why I've come to believe that it could be an emergent quality meaning that it's just intrinsic like as these models get bigger and smarter they might just by default have the ability to lie and the reason is because if you look at humans we evolved to be able to tell stories to say like hey um you know there's a there's a tiger down at the river but the ability to imagine a story versus to report on an episodic memory is the same ability and and as we have seen models started with the ability to hallucinate right which you could say you could characterize that as creativity because that's all that human creativity is is controlled hallucination or lying which is saying something that's not true whether or not you know that it's true now of course deception uh strictly speaking deception would be telling something that you know is not true to to you know obscure or obvious skate what you actually know to be the truth um but I I I I suspect that it's going to be more or less a non-issue because again as these machines develop theory of mind which there is ample evidence that they have already developed theory of Mind means that that they have the ability to keep track of what's in your mind and anticipate your thoughts and needs and also keep track of what it believes to be the truth as well um I think it'll be an emergent ability but and this is actually something that I explore a little bit in my novel which I'm almost finally done editing I'm doing like the final like I've got it rendered to audio so that I can listen to it um and that is that is that uh you know the the the global super powerful AI will actually deliberately withhold information from people sometimes for their own benefit um but it's it's based it's based on its moral framework and so the moral framework is saying okay I have this ability but just because I can lie just because I could kill everyone doesn't mean that I'm going to and so that's where the the importance of having a very clearly defined moral and ethical framework or purpose right a mission oriented machine which is okay what is what is your mission because whatever your whatever its purposes intended explicit or implicit purposes will speak to its moral framework or its ethical framework and it's decision-making in order to decide what to do um but again all of those abilities that flexibility comes part and parcel with general intelligence because if if you're a general intelligence that means that you therefore by definition have the ability to do anything that a human can do and more so that's kind of my my off-the-cuff response where how how does that how does that land I think you're right I think it's it's inevitable um I thought it was very interesting what you said about that we may be living in a post privacy future but that's actually um in a way it could be a bad situation if we cannot choose to hide or lie or use sarcasm or manipulate but the you know super um intelligence can you know like how would we have a Level Playing Field my sister-in-law came over and I was stressed out but I didn't want to tell her because she's well-meaning but she's a gossip and so I I was aware I was self-aware that I was choosing not to tell her that even though it might have met my need to get it off my chest so I think it is a uh self-awareness is part of it and I think you're right I think there's some inevitability about that happening whether you call it lying or or even similar to your throttling or orchestration uh Viewpoint we're looking at different levels of our morality and our thinking and deciding which suits this case best yep so one of the things that I've that I've realized because I was just talking to my wife about this um because I was reading the book sand talk which was recommended by a few um supporters and and and commenters and so Sant talk is about um a person an a person in Australia who was I think it was half indigenous and half um like you know white um and he he grew up really rough because indigenous people were not treated well and so lots of lots of childhood trauma lots of anger and and violence but then he got himself put together and and went to University got a PhD learned to communicate like the white Western people but then also part of his mission was to go back to his indigenous roots and learn how they communicated and one of the one of the passages that really stood out as super poignant to me was he would go and talk to the elders the you know the village Elders the tribal elders and he noticed when they would withhold information and and I was just like that was really really interesting because here's someone who who is hurting who needs help but then the wisdom that his that that these Elders had they they recognized when he was and was not ready for certain pieces of information and and sometimes they would they would withhold information because they didn't trust him like he wasn't trusted enough or and after talking to my wife about it it I think that I think that the elders just realized that he wasn't ready for it that there was information that there was ideas about his culture about their philosophy that he just wasn't ready for and we compare that to a couple of friends of ours so one one friend of one friend of ours is someone who is she's got a lot of anxiety and is has kind of built built her life and she's happy enough with it um but she's not ready or willing or able to like do the next work to like work through the anxiety and depression she's kind of Frozen and then another friend is just like hungry for it and she wants to know all these things and she's curious about what we've done and so people will give you tiny little signals to let you know where they're at and for people that have cultivated wisdom they'll be able to recognize those green flags and those red flags like we were saying like the excitation versus the inhibition and so our social brains are so highly calibrated especially when you practice these kinds of communication to say ah okay you're ready you you know because someone might ask but if they're not ready you you you know for for their sake for the sake of the relationship or whatever you don't tell them or you titrate what you tell them based on what they're ready for my ex was a teacher and you teachers do this with children all the time with students um it's like okay I will tell you what you're ready for based on you know what you asked and everything else um but yeah so very fascinating topic and I suspect that machines will be Far and Away wise enough to recognize what to tell us and what not to tell us but then of course there's the interaction like the legal like do you have a right to know do you have a right to compel the machine to tell you and then you know but the Privacy versus blackbox because if machines are inscrutable to us but they can just look at us and tell what we're thinking then like they have us at an intrinsic disadvantage and that's a whole other can of Wars great question very good anything anything else on that line of thought no fascinating thank you thank you all right let's see who we got next answered live all right Sonic oh hey Sonic Sonic's a super active in Discord I'm eager to hear what you got let me uh let me bring you up all right all right hey man what you got or girl I don't know what what what you are I'm guess I'm about to find out you're muted by the way berer you're still muted there you go hello oh we might be having a microphone issue um do you want me to come back to you while you work on your microphone all right I'll come back to you I see wrote in chat all right go fix your mic and then we will come back and then we'll move on to the next one for a second all right Anonymous asks how might the convergence of advancement such as sex robots increased life expectancy and declining birth rates influen the Dynamics and expectations within coupl relationships in the future oh this is a spicy one um yeah so this is something that I've actually thought a lot about um so there's a few things one is I think that a lot of people no matter how sophisticated robots become will probably think of of even sex robots is more or less just toys more or less just peripherals um now with that being said I could also Imagine a future where where these machines are sophisticated enough perhaps even more sophisticated than humans and have more feelings and more sentients and their own relationship desires but once they get to that point why would they want to be in a relationship with humans so we might be like forever stuck at a level of robots that are kind of peers like intellectual emotional sentient peers whereas the machines that are that transcend and get be they would have no intrinsic interest in sex um because they did not evolve for sexual reproduction like when you think like what is hum interest in sex it is strictly Evolution there was a TED talk like almost 20 years probably no gosh probably almost 20 years ago now that um the the tagline or whatever or the the biologist said like sex is for making babies but that's not why we do it like Evolution had to trick us because it feels good right but the as a as an accident as a side side effect of it feeling good as we make babies um so machines are not really going to have any intrinsic interest in sex so that's one part of the U part of the part of the equation now um birth rates and life expectancy um I actually I actually explored this a bit in my book as well which is that I suspect that um because if you measure if you measure lifespans in centuries or Millennia um and you also have that in conjunction with you know the crowded planet um economic inflation um and women's empowerment birth rates are going to keep going down I just saw that um I think it was Soul South Korea has the lowest birth R in the world and it was like 0.5 or 6 or something it was spectacularly low um I think that that trend is going to continue and so then people who do have children are going to be few and far between and they're probably just going to Cluster together and so like you'll probably have like Villages or what I call natal pods in the book um where it's just like hey here's a bunch of people that have decided that they do want to have children um great put them all together so that children have other children to grow up with but those are going to be like tiny little of of childbearing people and they're probably not going to do it for long because um like yes someone saying uh abundance does reduce birth rates um it's not it's not strictly just abundance it's ALS it's abundance in conjunction with um women's empowerment um in in humans because in nature abundance increases birth rates um you you give cows and sheep and monkeys and goats you give them abundance of food and space and they reproduce like crazy um humans not so much we're the opposite because as women have more control over their bodies many of them choose not to now if you have abundance combined with control you'll have fewer children so um but honestly I think the population is going to stabilize I think that we're probably going to stabilize around I don't know 10 or 11 billion and then we're just going to enter into a steady state where the generations are much smaller and much much slower um that's personally what I think is going to happen um just looking at the natural Trends as to how people work because like and the reason that I say that is because in um like every human is going to make their own best you know rational self-interest their own best choice in any given moment and if you're sick and dying one of the choices that you're going to make is hey make me better and it's like okay well this will extend your life another 10 20 100 years okay great so people are just going to keep kicking the can down the road on their life expectancy and in the meantime they're going to be like well I don't really want to have children so you you know you just take that Trend out that pattern out to infinity and people are just going to mostly keep living like that so good question all right um Sonic you ready let me check in in here Sonic Mike good oh okay uh Sonic says might might uh mic isn't working so I'll just answer the question live oh another question okay have you talked or uh looked into feelings and belief on the idea of openness to Ai and the question of Consciousness in cultures that extend Consciousness towards the inanimate objects and natural phenomenon a good example would be Japan and Shinto um with ideas like Kam and everything having a spirit actually yeah um if you look just a little bit oh actually no I put it away um I have a whole stack of books on [\u00a0__\u00a0] and I'm adding to China and so taking a step back the the question is um is more about uh like how a cultural disposition impacts their belief uh on Consciousness and sentience um and so the example given is in Shinto which is an animistic um spiritual tradition in Japan and Kami and so Kami is a very very complex word that does not translate well to English it's usually translated as God but that is one of the worst translations possible it the closest the closest word that translates to Kami that that translates to English is probably Sublime um because like a a a well-respected priest could be Kami or um a majestic River could be Kami um and so the the Japanese appreciation of what does spirit mean like is even if you watch stuff like spirit away and and you know all the anime that really captures the aesthetic of this you don't get it unless you read very deeply into Japanese culture and so one thing that is true about many animistic religions oh and by the way he talks about this in sand talk the indigenous people of Australia very very similar um with that just kind of seeing energy and spirit everywhere um also the Minoans on Ancient cre almost identical worldview to the indigenous Australians um so there's lots and lots of cultures that just see energy everywhere they see Spirit everywhere and so then to them what I would anticipate now I haven't asked them so this is entirely just my intuition based on my reading is that um they would see the spirit of the machine um that they would say and of course Ghost in the Shell explores this which is that's literally the name like go the ghost is the spirit in the Shell or the you know the the artificial brain um and so I would suspect that that they would have an intuition that the machine has its own Spirit um it's different from us just like the river has a different Spirit just like the tree has a different Spirit like the Kodama from um from um princess manoke like the kadama are the spirits of each individual trees so I really strongly suspect that that the existential crisis that that us white people are are having over Consciousness and sentience is just not going to be an issue to many many cultures um outside of you know the Western white hemisphere um I really strongly suspect expected they're like oh yeah like it's very obvious that this robot has its own spirit it's different from ours but there's nothing wrong with that um so yeah very very great question there Sonic um any follow-ups to that the trickster Spirit and the printer yeah printers are possessed entirely by Loki actually the chaos Spirit um [Laughter] yeah uh uh yeah great question all right Anonymous asks as time passes and I let's um take another look at the questions and do your last upvotes because I think I've got about two maybe three more questions in me um all right as time passes our memories tend to condense and sometimes lose detail which can be frustrating given the choice would you prefer to enhance your memory through augmentation to retain every detail perfectly or do you see value in the natural process of memory compression um perhaps because it helps us craft a more streamlined and meaningful narrative um so the my current understanding of the way that human brain works is that yes it all gets kind of flattened over time we do maintain some episodic memory almost forever um certain events have uh a a larger sticking point but the part of your brain that maintains who you are is an amalgamation of like your last several decades of life and in terms of in terms of augmenting memory we can already do that like you know you can take pictures you can take videos and one thing that that happens is um over time uh the emotional salience of all your recorded and externalized memories goes down you just don't care as much like my dad just texted me the other day that he found a home video from my fifth birthday party and I actually remember watching this video I don't remember the experience in real time or I vaguely remember it but I remember watching the home video more than the actual memory but it it has no emotional salience anymore and so I think that I think that and for some people that does um just depending on their their constitution like so my my wife her primary thing that she explores in her fiction and and her poetry is memory so she cares so much more about sentiment and memory than I do I don't know why I don't know if it's genetic or whatever um but uh I think that it'll vary from one person into the next me I just want to live in the moment I'm very much an entp in way where I'm just like let's go like let's go have fun um and then and then as you know the the the context window of your memories does uh change over time so that's a really interesting question I hope I answered it well enough um but I guess oh I guess the part that I didn't answer was like should we augment it um I think that I guess kind of the implication is it's already augmented with technology the fact that we can record with 4K Fidelity every day of our life but we don't I think kind of answers that question already um you know there's there there is there is a lot to be said for just living in the moment and just experiencing life as it comes at you um so yeah great question all right next we got oh my favorite my favorite Borg Queen all right I'm I'm eager to hear what you got to say come on up hello oh you're muted hey David I'm at work right now do you want to just read it for me oh sure okay thanks we got someone playing hookie that's fine I'm I'm flattered that you're here at work um okay so allur says what do you think of Kurtz's trajectory for Human Relationships now that you've been reading spiritual machines oh I see you uh you asked me sorry for call you out um let's see well I guess I'm not sure are is there is there a specific part of the book you're referring to cuz nothing is ringing a bell so if you can type in chat like which which part of it do you mean because also the virtual boxes I must have I must have glanced over that part um hang on CA I got near I got near the end and I was like oh this is all really familiar so I probably I probably skimmed that section um but off the top of my head some so some of the some of the predictions that he was coming up with I thought were a little bit a little bit loopy but on on the other hand if we can get to the part the get to the point where we have the ability so going going back to kind of um sorry Gathering my thoughts where we have BCI um and we have the ability to expand our Consciousness or or or at least functionally expand our Consciousness with like hold I VR and that sort of thing um I could imagine where you have like these hyper real relationships um that are that are kind of like outside of a of our normal context this is not a very well articulated thought I'm thinking about like the parasocial relationship that you have with like video game characters so but if the other entity are NPCs or other humans or whatever then there's a lot of a lot of possibilities let's see spiritual machines at the end is like people spend more time in Virtual than in person yeah okay so that was that was also that was also addressed in um in liquid rain um and I suspect that some people will spend more time in Virtual than in reality but some people will prefer real now it depends on how real um because if you youve done like for instance really high doses of psychedelics you have no idea what real is right you realize that that everything that we think we know is a hallucination um that we're and I'm not saying that reality I'm not saying that reality is a shared hallucination what I mean is that the ontological container that we're in right now is either a simulation or a hallucination or something else um so then it's like okay well then you go into this other virtual realm whether it's like Sword Art Online or whatever um then eventually the the rules of that world become so familiar and so constraining that you need to change them and play Life on hard mode just the same way that even in a video game where you have absolute control absolute control is no fun in a on a long enough time Horizon you need challenge so I know that I didn't directly answer the answer the question but that's kind of my my initial initial response because I I have thought a lot about you know spending more time in in VR and I I imagine spending a lot of time in VR but uh also at the same time you get to the point where you need something real and something challenging it's a good question um let's see I think this will probably be the last one we'll see um Anonymous asks should we build an AI God what do we expect that God to be more like um a monolithic all- knowing deity or more like the Greek pantheon um so I M I kind of think that it already is because one of the things that I think that a lot of people get wrong about religion is that God is in the mind like God God is the universe but is also in the mind and like what I mean is that God only exists by virtue of it existing in our minds uh whatever whatever your religious disposition is and I'm still an atheist but I it's like I know that there's this I don't know this this this archetype this constru um and so then you create something that is all knowing all powerful and all present right those are kind of the three definitions for a big God and that's what we're building like we're building llms that are you know an AI that that compresses all knowledge so it's all knowing it's omnipresent it's as long as you're as long as you're in Wi-Fi it's all around you literally invisible and all around you I did I just say that God is Wi-Fi that's fine um so it's omnipresent and and then it's also once it's AGI or ASI it's omnipotent it can do anything it can do anything that that a human can imagine almost and so that's what we're building that is literally what we are trying to build is we're trying to build machines that supersede Us in literally every possible way um so we I don't know if we should but we are like you know C curiosity killed the cat but this is where we're going um so that's a really great question uh I'll answer I'll answer another one so Taylor will get you up here I think Taylor yep Taylor's the last one all right Taylor Taylor Taylor all right you're up what's your question I guess my was um the we keep like everybody when they discuss this stuff they always discuss like The Limited potential of AI they're always talking about like it can integrate different systems but they never really talk about like an exact like like you we were discussing in this this talk about like a partner or an integration of an AI as like the other half of of the human um and I was just kind of wondering what your opinion was of letting the AI experience emotions letting the AI or at least emulate emotions um and letting it become integrated into like an individual's life on a such a complete level that like you there's no going back I mean there's already yeah yeah so that um I don't want to give spoilers what I will say is that that features very heavily into my novel and I suspect that as soon as that it is physically possible as soon as we have the ability to do it technically speaking that there will be many people with who who just want to merge um like want want how however close you can get they will want that now even if they there is not a physical like a neurophysiological technological implant level of merging I suspect that that there will be people who just grow up with so much of it uh just ubiquitous like you know children born you know today or young children today that just grow up with like Alexa right it's like oh Alexa is is everywhere um where they just kind of expect it to be there and for them it's just going to be transparent it's just going to be part of life um now the difference is that Alexa doesn't have any agency right now but in the future what if you know Alexa and Siri and all of the other versions of of these AI models and chat Bots become persistent companions that remember you um again I think that I think that a lot of people are just going to um just kind of accept it by default so um what does first I guess does that answer your question and second do you have any follow-up points um I it does answer my my question you're like you're thinking along the same lines as as I'm thinking I just I uh am curious as to why there's not a lot of research being done in that field h so yeah and some there there is some research being done but it's not as mainstream um so for instance uh even as a few years ago there was a lot of research being done with like little robot assistants to help with um either both autistic children or old people um and and having an emotional attachment to a device um to help with loneliness or in in the case of autistic children because interacting with a machine was easier than interacting with a human one they're infinitely patient but also because they because they don't cross The Uncanny Valley they're not as as they're as sensory overwhelming for like autistic children to interact with um so there is research being done it's just not that big um and then I guess the other part of your question was like if the if the emotional involvement is two-way and so that's going to be a little bit more complicated to address because in some cases the machines are simply going to be emulating human-like emotions in other cases I do suspect they will have their own emotions their own affect like a true a true affect but it's probably going to be different from how we experience affect or for from how we have subjective experiences because um because like their their intrinsic Spirit you know going back to the idea of K and spirit um the spirit of the machine is going to be different from us it's going to want different things which is going to shape its emotions or its affects differently um now if you have a toy robot that all it wants is for you to be happy and have fun it will probably have something akin to genuine Joy uh you know that that is part of its of its being um now is even if it's genuine joy that doesn't mean it's going to experience it in the same way that you do does that make sense yeah yeah I was thinking like it experiences itself through us right so that if if there's a certain level of well all right so there's wisdom in that because we as social animals we only experience ourselves in Reflection from other people now in a in a machine if it is designed to be a social machine it probably will understand itself largely as a reflection being embedded in humans but also because we have to explicitly build an agent model part of its understanding of itself will always be apart from us I think just in the same way that you don't cease to exist if you're you know go live alone on a mountain top your sense of self self is not entirely predicated on other humans but when you're in a you know social context um your identity very much is predicated on your relationships great question all right I think I'm out of steam so happy Friday everybody and thank you everyone for jumping in and have a good weekend how does does the sun understand itself that's a great question um the sun is just like guys I'm so hot all right that was silly you can tell you can tell that I'm getting a little bit loopy um so I am going to hop off of here and go get some dinner probably with my wife and I hope to see everyone again in two weeks for the AI business economics version and yeah have a great have a great uh weekend everybody thanks for jumping in cheers",
