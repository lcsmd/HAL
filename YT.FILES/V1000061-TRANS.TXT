  "transcript": "In this video, I'm going to show you how I create\u00a0 custom AI agent teams to do the work for me.\u00a0\u00a0 Specifically in this tutorial, we will create\u00a0 a custom AI agency that develops responsive web\u00a0\u00a0 applications using Next.js and Material UI. But\u00a0 the best part about this tutorial is that most of\u00a0\u00a0 the work was actually done by AI rather than by\u00a0 myself. Yes, almost anyone can now create their\u00a0\u00a0 own custom AI agent teams just by chatting with\u00a0 the Genesys Agency that creates your agents for\u00a0\u00a0 you. So whether you are an AI developer or an\u00a0 entrepreneur, this video will show you how to\u00a0\u00a0 create those custom agent swarms for your or\u00a0 your client's business. Let's dive in. Okay,\u00a0\u00a0 so let's check this out live. Let me know what\u00a0 you guys think about the new format. And now\u00a0\u00a0 you can basically use the Genesys agency directly\u00a0 from your CLI to get started much faster. Simply\u00a0\u00a0 run agency swarm genesis command and this will\u00a0 activate the Genesys agency directly in your\u00a0\u00a0 terminal. So then you can just say like I need\u00a0 a web development agency. So I've prepared this\u00a0\u00a0 prompt in advance and I'm just going to say that\u00a0 the goal is to develop responsive web applications\u00a0\u00a0 using Next.js and MUI, which is what we use in\u00a0 our agency, and that the CEO must communicate\u00a0\u00a0 with the designer, who communicates with the\u00a0 web developer and copywriter, and then I'm\u00a0\u00a0 also describing which tools each agent must use.\u00a0 Perfect, so now it proposes the initial structure\u00a0\u00a0 for my agency exactly like I described with the\u00a0 Genesys CEO, who communicates with the designer,\u00a0\u00a0 who then communicates with the web developer and\u00a0 copywriter. It also defines some initial goals,\u00a0\u00a0 mission, processes for my agency, and then asks\u00a0 me to confirm if this aligns with my vision which\u00a0\u00a0 it does so I'm just going to tell it to proceed.\u00a0 Awesome so first the Genesy CEO creates the agency\u00a0\u00a0 folder for my agency which you can see right here\u00a0 on the left with the agency manifesto and then it\u00a0\u00a0 proceeds with telling the agent creator to create\u00a0 the first agent. After the designer agent has been\u00a0\u00a0 created, which you can also see on the left, it\u00a0 proceeds with telling the tool creator agent to\u00a0\u00a0 create tools for this agent. As you can see, the\u00a0 tool creator then creates the first tool, which is\u00a0\u00a0 the browser analysis tool, which uses beautiful\u00a0 soup. By default, we might want to adjust this\u00a0\u00a0 later, but so far it looks pretty good. It then\u00a0 proceeds with testing the tool, but as you can\u00a0\u00a0 see it encounters an error because non-type\u00a0 object has no attribute loader I suppose this\u00a0\u00a0 is because the beautiful soup is not installed\u00a0 yet. So let's see what happens next Okay,\u00a0\u00a0 it then tells the agent creator that there was an\u00a0 error which it then tells the CEO agent Then the\u00a0\u00a0 CEO agent tells the agent creator to create the\u00a0 next agent, which is the web developer agent's\u00a0\u00a0 instructions. The first tool that it creates is\u00a0 called the directory navigator tool and as you can\u00a0\u00a0 see it just simply uses the OS change dir method\u00a0 which is probably how I would implement this tool\u00a0\u00a0 as well. And then it also creates a file reader\u00a0 tool which simply opens the file using Python,\u00a0\u00a0 reads the content and then returns it. This\u00a0 actually looks pretty good already so I don't\u00a0\u00a0 think there are even any modifications required\u00a0 just yet. And then it also creates the FileWriter\u00a0\u00a0 tool, which takes the file path, the content as a\u00a0 string, and then it opens this file, and then it\u00a0\u00a0 does the confirmation as the tool output. Then it\u00a0 tells the agent creator that all of the tools were\u00a0\u00a0 successfully created. One tool we didn't check out\u00a0 is a comment executor tool, which uses subprocess\u00a0\u00a0 with the command. This could be dangerous, so\u00a0 we might want to modify this later. Perfect! So\u00a0\u00a0 now the Genesys CEO tells me that the WebCrafters\u00a0 agency has been successfully established. However,\u00a0\u00a0 it seems like the Genesys CEO forgot to create the\u00a0 Copywriter agent, but now we can easily fix this\u00a0\u00a0 with the new mentions feature that I have added\u00a0 to this framework. Now, when creating your agency,\u00a0\u00a0 you can add multiple agents as the entry points\u00a0 for communication. So, in the top level array,\u00a0\u00a0 you can now include multiple agents, not just\u00a0 the CEO agent, and then the user will be able\u00a0\u00a0 to communicate directly with those agents. The\u00a0 way you use this tool is simply add an add sign\u00a0\u00a0 and then name the agent that you want to talk\u00a0 with, followed by the message to this agent. So\u00a0\u00a0 I'm going to say to the agent creator instead of\u00a0 the Genesy CEO, which speeds up the communication\u00a0\u00a0 flow. So now the agent creator tells me that the\u00a0 copywriter agent has been created, and you can\u00a0\u00a0 see it on the left with the instructions files\u00a0 defined accordingly. Then the CEO tells me that\u00a0\u00a0 we can run this agency with the python agency.py.\u00a0 Cool, so now it opens up a link with the Gradio.\u00a0\u00a0 First of all, you can now upload files. You\u00a0 can select which agent you are talking with,\u00a0\u00a0 but as I said before, you do have to add those\u00a0 agents right here. So if you add like another\u00a0\u00a0 agent like this in the top level array, you will\u00a0 be able to communicate with it as well directly.\u00a0\u00a0 So let me rerun the agency.py command with the\u00a0 designer in the top level array as well and\u00a0\u00a0 just show you how this works. All right, cool.\u00a0 So now as you can see in the recipient agent,\u00a0\u00a0 you can also select the designer, not just the\u00a0 CEO agent, and then let's just try to say hi,\u00a0\u00a0 for example. Cool, so now we get the response from\u00a0 the designer directly. But before we actually run\u00a0\u00a0 this agency and try to create our first website,\u00a0 we do need to make a few adjustments because I\u00a0\u00a0 certainly do not want the web developer agent to\u00a0 execute any commands on my PC. So let's quickly\u00a0\u00a0 go through all of these tools starting with the\u00a0 web developer and then adjust them accordingly.\u00a0\u00a0 So the command executor tool I'm going to rename\u00a0 into simply run command. Then I'm going to define\u00a0\u00a0 all of the commands that this agent can run in\u00a0 advance. This way we can ensure that our agent\u00a0\u00a0 does not execute anything unexpected. For the\u00a0 commands field I'm going to define a couple of\u00a0\u00a0 options using the literal type. The first one will\u00a0 be build and the second one will be create next\u00a0\u00a0 app. Then I'm going to adjust the execution\u00a0 logic to execute only certain commands based\u00a0\u00a0 on the input from the agent So if the command is\u00a0 create next app We're just going to run npm create\u00a0\u00a0 next app and if the command is built we're going\u00a0 to run npm run build So this tools directory is\u00a0\u00a0 a new addition to my framework where essentially\u00a0 all the tools folder when initializing your agent.\u00a0\u00a0 Additionally, don't forget to rename the file so\u00a0 it matches the name of your tool, otherwise it\u00a0\u00a0 will not be imported. So the rest of the tools for\u00a0 the web developer agent actually look pretty good,\u00a0\u00a0 but I do want to add one extra tool that would\u00a0 allow this agent to browse the current directory\u00a0\u00a0 and see what files are inside. I'm gonna call\u00a0 this tool ListDir. This tool will essentially\u00a0\u00a0 just take a dir path and then return the current\u00a0 directory tree as a string. And finally, I also\u00a0\u00a0 want to modify the browser analysis tool for the\u00a0 designer agent because I do not want this agent\u00a0\u00a0 to read the whole HTML of the webpage since HTML\u00a0 contains a lot of useless information. Instead,\u00a0\u00a0 I want to use a tool similar to the one\u00a0 I've created in my browsing agent video,\u00a0\u00a0 that will take the screenshot of the current web\u00a0 page and then analyze it with GPT-4V. So how this\u00a0\u00a0 tool will function is it will open the local host\u00a0 URL with the 3000 port where the next application\u00a0\u00a0 will be hosted, then it will get the screenshot\u00a0 of the current browser window and use GPT-4V with\u00a0\u00a0 a special prompt to analyze this screenshot. So\u00a0 the designer agent will be able to use this tool\u00a0\u00a0 to check if the current web page aligns with the\u00a0 provided design. Now let's go ahead and adjust\u00a0\u00a0 some instructions for our agents. For example,\u00a0 I want to ensure that the web developer agent\u00a0\u00a0 understands that it first needs to surf the web\u00a0 page before submitting the work to the designer\u00a0\u00a0 so the designer can analyze it later. I'm just\u00a0 going to include this in the primary tasks. Okay,\u00a0\u00a0 so finally we're ready to test this. To run your\u00a0 agency, simply execute the agency.py file. In the\u00a0\u00a0 first message, I'm just going to say that I need a\u00a0 new website for my AI development agency, ArsenAI.\u00a0\u00a0 Then the CEO immediately tells the designer agent\u00a0 to create a compelling copy and the design for my\u00a0\u00a0 agency. Awesome so now we get a complete copy for\u00a0 my new website with a cool headline, Relationizing\u00a0\u00a0 Your Business Through AI Development and a copy\u00a0 for each section. What's funny is that it actually\u00a0\u00a0 ends on the exact same phrase that I have on my\u00a0 current website, which is, ready to transform\u00a0\u00a0 your business? Cool, so then the CEO agent wants\u00a0 to confirm if this design aligns with my vision,\u00a0\u00a0 which it does, so I'm going to tell it to proceed\u00a0 with the development. Obviously, this is just my\u00a0\u00a0 prompt. You can adjust the instructions for each\u00a0 agent accordingly. In my case, I was constantly\u00a0\u00a0 iterating on the system, running those agents, and\u00a0 adjusting the instructions and tools accordingly\u00a0\u00a0 until this agency performed the tasks as I\u00a0 expected. As you can see now, the web developer\u00a0\u00a0 agent gets the first task to develop the hero\u00a0 section, and then it executes the first command\u00a0\u00a0 to create Next.js application, which we should\u00a0 now see on the left. Yes, so as you can see,\u00a0\u00a0 we now got the arson.ai folder with some Next.js\u00a0 boilerplate code. And then the agent proceeds with\u00a0\u00a0 installing some additional requirements, which\u00a0 are material UI emotion and emotion style. This\u00a0\u00a0 is because in my agency manifesto I said that I\u00a0 want to use material UI for the development. Okay\u00a0\u00a0 cool so now our agent created the first component\u00a0 in the components folder with our copy unleash the\u00a0\u00a0 power of artificial intelligence. Then it should\u00a0 proceed with importing this component into the\u00a0\u00a0 index.tsx file as you can see right here. Then\u00a0 it builds our application and reports back to\u00a0\u00a0 the designer who then sends a new section for\u00a0 the development. We can also check the progress\u00a0\u00a0 locally if we navigate into our new Next.js app\u00a0 directory and then run the development server with\u00a0\u00a0 npm run dev command. Awesome. So this is what our\u00a0 website looks like right now. It seems like we're\u00a0\u00a0 still using Next.JS styles, but we can fix this\u00a0 later. The next section that our agent has just\u00a0\u00a0 created is our mission section, which you can\u00a0 also see in the components folder on the left.\u00a0\u00a0 It also uses some icons from material UI icons\u00a0 package. However, it seems like the build fails,\u00a0\u00a0 because currently this package is not installed.\u00a0 So then, WebDeveloper performs the next command\u00a0\u00a0 to install material UI icons package, which is\u00a0 now added into the package. JSON, then the app\u00a0\u00a0 builds successfully. Okay, pretty cool. I mean,\u00a0 yeah, we're getting somewhere. The next section\u00a0\u00a0 that our designer sends to the WebDeveloper is\u00a0 expertise across industries section with, you\u00a0\u00a0 know, some basic layout, visual elements and text\u00a0 content. Awesome, so we got this new component\u00a0\u00a0 with also some icons from Material UI. Okay, as\u00a0 you can see, the expertise is now also added to\u00a0\u00a0 our LinkedIn page. Let's check it out. Oops, so we\u00a0 have to rebuild the website apparently. All right,\u00a0\u00a0 so this is what we got now. Seems like there are\u00a0 some issues with styling, but we can probably\u00a0\u00a0 fix this later. Awesome, now finally the web\u00a0 development agent creates the final section,\u00a0\u00a0 which is the footer section with some contact\u00a0 information and then it also adds it to the\u00a0\u00a0 index.tsx file. So now we have this nice footer\u00a0 and our landing page is pretty much complete.\u00a0\u00a0 I mean, I understand that it's not quite there\u00a0 yet, but the fact that this whole landing page\u00a0\u00a0 was developed by AI, that in fact, was created\u00a0 by another AI, that's pretty cool. And actually,\u00a0\u00a0 we can make it much better just by adding some\u00a0 themes from Material UI. Awesome, so the styling\u00a0\u00a0 of our website already looks much better. The\u00a0 colors seem to be fixed, and the only problem that\u00a0\u00a0 I can still see right here is that the contact\u00a0 section is kind of broken and the button should\u00a0\u00a0 definitely not be here so let's just ask our web\u00a0 developer with fixing this final section. So then\u00a0\u00a0 the CEO tells that the client has reported that\u00a0 the layout of the contact us section is still\u00a0\u00a0 broken. It's funny that it actually refers to\u00a0 me as to a client because of how we defined the\u00a0\u00a0 agency manifesto. Awesome, so now it seems like it\u00a0 rewrote the whole contact us section and now it is\u00a0\u00a0 using a grid which is a responsive component from\u00a0 material UI, which means that most likely our app\u00a0\u00a0 is now going to look much better. It's pretty cool\u00a0 that you can use this agency kind of like as your\u00a0\u00a0 pair programmer and just converse back and forth\u00a0 with it and at the same time work on those files.\u00a0\u00a0 As you can see it again runs into a build issue.\u00a0 It seems like it inappropriately used the change\u00a0\u00a0 lines tool. And here, as you can see, actually in\u00a0 this run command tool, I'm including some special\u00a0\u00a0 instructions at the end of the function output\u00a0 in case if the command fails. And specifically,\u00a0\u00a0 I'm telling this agent to rewrite the entire\u00a0 file with the file writer tool in case if it\u00a0\u00a0 gets stuck. So I found that providing those\u00a0 instructions, depending on specific conditions\u00a0\u00a0 in your tools, allows you to much better\u00a0 control your system. So as you can see now,\u00a0\u00a0 it rewrites the whole file just as I instructed\u00a0 and then builds the web application. Perfect. So\u00a0\u00a0 this is what our website looks like now. As you\u00a0 can see, the styling is much better. The form is\u00a0\u00a0 also not broken any longer. The Contact Us text\u00a0 is below the ready to transform your business\u00a0\u00a0 text just as I requested. And let's see if this\u00a0 is actually responsive. Yep, as you can see,\u00a0\u00a0 the whole application is pretty much responsive.\u00a0 There are some issues with styling, but of course,\u00a0\u00a0 you can fix this pretty fast. So yeah, all the\u00a0 code for this agency will be on a new repository\u00a0\u00a0 that I created on GitHub called Agency Swarm\u00a0 Lab. In this repository, we will keep adding\u00a0\u00a0 more and more agencies created with Agency Swarm\u00a0 for various use cases. So if you have any cool\u00a0\u00a0 use cases that you've made before, feel free to\u00a0 contribute. So if you have any cool use cases that\u00a0\u00a0 you've made before, feel free to contribute.
