  "transcript": "and good morning so I just had this idea when I was out for my walk um and I actually get this question a lot I get it from in the comments and I also get it in my patreon community and that is what kind of business would you start I get it on podcast interviews I get it on all sorts of things and I haven't had good answers I've had a couple answers teed up but it was kind of percolating and fermenting in the back of my mind and so on my walk this morning I was just like you know what let me let me think about this and so I actually came up with a handful of business ideas that I would start right now if I had the time and money and energy but as some of you know I am a disabled autistic person so I don't have the energy um and I'm pretty busy so I don't really have the time or the money so I'm hoping that I can inspire a few people out there who do have the time money and energy to do these ideas so without further Ado here are four ideas of businesses that would start right now in light of everything that I know that's happening with artificial intelligence and everything that I predict is coming down the pipeline so the first one and I've talked about this on a couple videos but I want to go into a little bit uh deeper dive and that is a hyperlocal Securities market and so here's the problem here's here's the problem statement right now if you sign up for a brokerage account there are approximately 9,000 Securities in America that you can buy buy and trade those are stocks um on New York Stock Exchange you know NASDAQ and S&P 500 and those sorts of things um it depends on how you count them like if you if you count the pink sheets or whatever but generally speaking you have about 9,000 options to choose from which sounds like a lot until you remember that there are over 5 million businesses in America alone and countless more other uh assets that you could possibly invest in so most of the American Market is not actually in the market it is all privately owned and it's all locked away behind very Arcane Securities laws which means that even if you wanted to invest in a local Farm or a local grocery store or even a local data center you don't have any way of doing that and to me this is like kind of a brain dead simple option a path forward and so basically here's kind of the the reasoning if we assume that artificial intelligence is going to dislocate jobs or transform the economy or whatever it's going to make it's going to make changes right that's what technology does um it's going to make changes and uh those who own the data centers are going to be making most of the money so in light of stakeholder capitalism or um you know decentralized private ownership or libertarian Socialism or whatever you want to call it if we create a platform and a few legal reforms would also be required to have a hyper local Securities Market that allows everyone to invest in these kinds of assets particularly data centers but really anything that generates value such which is you know rental properties or that sort of thing that could really transform the economy to make sure that every individual has economic agency in the future and has a way of participating in every aspect of the economy and then you know the follow-up question is okay well if people are already broke how do you how do you get people to participate and I'm glad you asked and basically what you do is through tax incentives such as negative income tax and other tax breaks you basically mean it's kind of the same way that like um that you know 401ks are you know like taxfree or whatever you basically do the same thing so that any qualified local investment you either get it taxfree or you actually get that money back at the end of the year to incentivize local investment uh as well as just incentivizing participating in the economy until everyone reaches the same level so this would I actually talked about this with some people and they they T they said the Securities laws are way out of date and the the regulatory nightmare of trying to implement this would be insane on top of the technical problems the AI That's required the blockchain that's required um so but if someone had the the money and chuta to to tackle this and you would have huge first mover advantage and also you'd have a statutory Moe in the form of those Securities and Regulatory Compliance meaning that if you figured out how to get your hyperlocal securities Market approved that would give you kind of a deao monopoly now I'm not necessarily in favor of monopolies but it has to be appealing to venture capitalists so number one hyper local security Market based on AI based on blockchain and I want to see in the future instead of 9,000 Securities available in America I want to see 5 million Securities available in America and then once you once you uh stick that Landing once you figure that out it'll generalize globally allowing people in France to invest locally in France and allow people in Norway to invest locally in Norway and Africa and so on and so forth um I think that this could be a really critical component of the economy of the future now uh business number two that I would start is CEO as a service now I've had uh consultation clients and and other people in the past kind of approach me with similarish ideas uh basically the way that that companies are trying to use AI right now is kind of a CEO co-pilot where it's like hey I just want to use AI to to help my CEO be smarter and be more productive and that sort of thing but I'm like what if we actually just reinvent governance of businesses what if you have CEO as a service what if you had executive board as a service what if you had politicians as a service and but by starting with those particular roles and responsibilities because those are relatively well defined you know the the CEO has an obligation to shareholders or stakeholders and employees and Regulatory Compliance and so on and so forth pretty well understood likewise the executive board also has a pretty clearly defined roles and the reason that I would start here rather than just trying to do a turnkey AI you know uh kind of top to bottom AI run company is if you start here then you have the ability to say hey um let's you know with this TurnKey solution create a company purchase assets do all that other kinds of stuff and I know a lot of you out there in the audience my my mental model of the audience is saying you're talking about a dow decentralized autonomous organization exactly but the reason the primary reason that Dows are not sustainable right now one is lack of regulatory oversight so you get rug pools but number two is expertise is rare uh there like yes you might say wisdom of the masses and consensus and that sort of stuff consensus is very very slow and very inefficient and it does not always produce the wisest outcomes but if we assume that AI is soon going to be smarter than most humans then why not just delegate to AI um I was watching the um the the interview with Brian Johnson the the longevity dude and I know I've said mean things about him in the past but I actually listened to him for three hours yesterday and I actually agree with most of what he says so I'm coming around um on on what he said anyways but he like what he did his experiment was can I make an AI an AI algorithm that's better at running my life than me and he said the answer to him is unequivocally yes now obviously not everyone wants to hand the keys over of their life to an AI algorithm yet but we're getting there and if AI hypothetically could be demonstrated to be a better CEO than a human why not so I would start building that right now I think that I think that gp4 and Claude 3 are probably close to smart enough at least to make small short-term tactical decisions that are superior to humans certainly smarter than some humans that I know absolutely Far and Away um but if you could get this as a turnkey service where it's basically hey hire this and then you just carry out the will of your virtual CEO great um so that's that's idea number two so idea number three and I've talked about this before I've read about it in my books and I've talked about it quite extensively is just personalized AI entertainment as a subscription basically like Netflix but Ai and bespoke so that would be personalized novels personalized music personalized movies personalized video games we're not quite there yet the the models are not quite good enough to do all this like you know right off the fly but we are really close we are really really darn close and so now is the right time to build that business so you have the infrastructure and the investment and you probably could do at least short stories and music um like on a personalized uh short stories and music and maybe even maybe by the end of the year like um like anime you know like personalized anime uh but yeah I think you you now is now would be the right time to do that because again you know it's coming it's coming soon it's coming fast um and there's not I mean it's a pretty obvious business business model I think Netflix proved that you know big data and streaming and that sort of stuff um and the models are pretty cheap like you can generate lots and lots of music and images and soon you're going to be able to do end to end video all pretty much automatically uh so yeah I don't honestly I think that's probably the easiest most straightforward service um now it because it's easy and straightforward it's going to be super super competitive so this is probably going to be one of the hardest ones CU you're going to be competing with Disney and Amazon and Netflix and everyone else so take that one with a grain of salt um number four is Big Data curation so one thing that occurred to me is all these models that we're using they keep getting updates so they're only about 6 months out of date and it and it occurred to me this is going to be a Perpetual service where forever and an on like for the rest of human history however long or short it happens to be we're going to need data to update models and when you look open Ai and others signing huge deals with Reddit with Twitter with New York Times and all these other places they want data so if you get really good at curating huge data sets whether it's text or audio or video or news or tweets or whatever um there's a lot of money in that there is a huge amount of money in that and so um back in the day some of the stuff that I did I did automatic uh you know Bitcoin trading or crypto trading um and then also you know pointing machine Lear learning at stock market data I mean those data subscriptions that exist are already out there and they're already really expensive so this is a tried and true business model of just curating data where it's like here's an API download your your your daily you know 8 terabytes of fresh data and have fun um that would be a very very lucrative business model and it would be pretty easy to set up I think now I will add at the end one business model that I would not tou with a 10-ft pole and that is anything to do with robots or drones now one reason is just because that market is super super saturated um number two is Hardware is really really difficult to do and then number three is military uses um now obviously I understand that you know we live in a complicated messy world and militaries are necessary I have no beef with that I understand the ne the necessity of it but I personally could not uh live with myself if I built something that could be used for weapons um but that's a personal personal thing so anyways those are four business models that um I think should exist I would like to see all of them exist in fact I'm I'm sure some of them probably already do um but yeah uh so if someone has the time money energy and inclination please make them happen and then uh let me know hit me up on substack or patreon cheers",
