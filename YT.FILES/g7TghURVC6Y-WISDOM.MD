SUMMARY:
Sabine Hossenfelder discusses a report on AI predictions for 2040, based on interviews with experts using the Delphi method, highlighting concerns about AI safety, truth discernment, and software complexity.

IDEAS:
- Experts predict AI safety will be compromised by 2040 due to international competition.
- The Delphi method leverages expert knowledge for actionable plans, named after the Oracle of Delphi.
- By 2040, AI could cause events leading to at least a million deaths, termed 'megadeath'.
- Quantum computing's commercial irrelevance is expected to continue through 2040.
- AI will blur the lines between truth and fiction, leading to an arms race of fake content.
- Experts foresee a future where internet assets are owned through tokenship, not blockchain technology.
- Increasing software complexity will make distinguishing between accidents and deliberate manipulation difficult.
- Proposals include regulations on AI safety, ambient accountability, and better education in relevant fields.
- The impact of AI on scientific publication and the spread of misinformation is underestimated.
- Nautilus magazine offers insights into current scientific discussions, including postquantum gravity theories.
- Experts agree that blockchain technology has proved its irrelevance for future digital transactions.
- The potential for AI to facilitate the production of fake scientific papers is a significant concern.
- An arms race in AI-generated fake content could sometimes mistakenly flag true content as fake.
- The increasing difficulty in discerning truth from fiction in media is a major concern for experts.
- Experts call for more input from social sciences on the impact of AI and software development changes.
- The reliance on scientific publications for fact-checking could be undermined by AI-generated misinformation.
- The concept of 'ambient accountability' in software development is proposed to enhance AI safety.
- The report suggests that AI's impact on truth discernment will create a Philip K. Dick-like reality.
- Experts predict that tokenization of internet assets will become common by 2040 through distributed services.
- The challenge of managing the complexity of AI and software is highlighted as a key issue for the future.
- Concerns about AI safety are driven more by national competition than by competition between companies.
- The use of the Delphi method for gathering expert opinions on AI's future highlights its continued relevance.

INSIGHTS:
- International competition, not corporate rivalry, will drive compromises in AI safety by 2040.
- Quantum computing's lack of commercial relevance will persist, challenging its anticipated impact.
- The blurring of truth and fiction by AI will create a complex landscape of misinformation.
- Tokenization of internet assets signals a shift away from blockchain towards other distributed technologies.
- The complexity of AI and software will increasingly obscure the line between accidents and manipulation.
- Regulatory proposals for AI safety may be ignored despite their potential to mitigate risks.
- The underestimated impact of AI on scientific publication poses a threat to factual integrity.
- An arms race in fake content detection by AI could inadvertently undermine genuine information.
- The reliance on scientific publications for fact-checking is vulnerable to AI-generated misinformation.
- The future of digital transactions may move beyond blockchain to more efficient distributed services.
