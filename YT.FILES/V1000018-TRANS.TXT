  "transcript": "AI development is simply\u00a0 not what it used to be. \u00a0 As someone who has developed and sold\u00a0 my first AI project back in 2018,\u00a0\u00a0 I can assure you that today success in this field\u00a0 requires a completely different skillset. \u00a0 So in this video, I will reveal the\u00a0 three key areas that I'm learning as\u00a0\u00a0 an AI developer in 2023, which not only\u00a0 helped me stay ahead of the game but\u00a0\u00a0 also allowed me to consistently generate\u00a0 around 10k a month in profit in this ever\u00a0\u00a0 evolving field. Let's dive in! \u00a0 Number 1, software architecture Yes, architecture, not development. \u00a0 As an AI developer, I am no longer even\u00a0 learning AI development itself. Instead,\u00a0\u00a0 I am learning design patterns and\u00a0 architectural styles that are essential to\u00a0\u00a0 designing maintainable and scalable systems. So what does it even have to do with AI? \u00a0 Well, first of all, I believe that very soon\u00a0 GPT models and autonomous agents will be able\u00a0\u00a0 to handle most of development by themselves. We have already seen projects like GPT engineer\u00a0\u00a0 or smol-ai that can develop and even debug their\u00a0 own code. If you ask ChatGPT, it can literally\u00a0\u00a0 spit out any sorting algorithm in 3 seconds. All\u00a0 of these algorithms took me months to master,\u00a0\u00a0 and even right now I can barely recall the\u00a0 difference between bubble and selection sorts. \u00a0 But where autonomous agents\u00a0 and GPT models fall short,\u00a0\u00a0 however, is at reasoning and at design work. Design work is valued much higher because it goes\u00a0\u00a0 beyond mere knowledge and requires a thorough\u00a0 understanding of the domain and context about\u00a0\u00a0 the task at hand. There are no right answers;\u00a0 everything in architecture is a tradeoff. \u00a0 Think about Tesla, for example. It can easily\u00a0 takes you from destination A to destination\u00a0\u00a0 B without your direct involvement, but it\u00a0 can't decide for you where you want to go. \u00a0 The same goes for the development\u00a0 of large code bases.  \u00a0 Even if there were no token limits, there is\u00a0 no way you can communicate all the context\u00a0\u00a0 about your problem to AI. We incorporate\u00a0 so much information in our minds that it's\u00a0\u00a0 simply not possible to put it all in words. So while I can confidently outsource development,\u00a0\u00a0 I would never outsource the\u00a0 design and architecture of a\u00a0\u00a0 big project to AI. At least not without\u00a0 my direct supervision. I do sometimes\u00a0\u00a0 consult with GPT-4 on certain design\u00a0 decisions, but doing so still requires\u00a0\u00a0 you knowing the right questions to ask. And secondly, AI models are no longer trained\u00a0\u00a0 from scratch for each and every project. Just a few years ago, it was common for me to\u00a0\u00a0 build AI models from scratch for each specific\u00a0 use case. Today, I wouldn't even think of\u00a0\u00a0 building a model without first considering\u00a0 commercial or open-source solutions.  \u00a0 This means that our codebases must be more\u00a0 adaptable than ever. We must be able to easily\u00a0\u00a0 switch from one model to another in case if a\u00a0 better solution becomes available. Moreover,\u00a0\u00a0 many of my clients already have some sort of\u00a0 infrastructure setup, and as an AI developer\u00a0\u00a0 I must make sure that the ai solution does\u00a0 not conflict with their existing systems. \u00a0 Some resources that I highly recommend for\u00a0 learning software architecture are the book\u00a0\u00a0 \"Fundamentals of Software Architecture,\"\u00a0 by mark richards and neal ford, which I\u00a0\u00a0 am currently reading, and a software\u00a0 architecture course on Coursera. \u00a0 Next up we learning Edge AI. Edge AI is a process of integrating\u00a0\u00a0 and running AI directly on local\u00a0 devices like smartphones or IoT. \u00a0 If you had a chance to look at the most recent\u00a0 Apple presentation, even our watches can now run\u00a0\u00a0 language models like Siri locally.  And although Siri is probably\u00a0\u00a0 still far behind the latest transformer\u00a0 models, the trend is pretty clear. \u00a0 We have so much extra compute in our\u00a0 devices that running AI models is one\u00a0\u00a0 only reasonable way to utilize all this\u00a0 power. This has trenemdous potentaila to\u00a0\u00a0 revolutionize how we interact with technology. Transformer models can easily call third-party\u00a0\u00a0 APIs and take actions on our behalf. So just\u00a0 imagine if you could not only run ChatGPT locally\u00a0\u00a0 on your iPhone but also allow it to control\u00a0 your favorite apps, like Uber or Twitter. \u00a0 What if you could make a post or order a taxi\u00a0 without even needing to touch your phone? If this\u00a0\u00a0 was the case, you would not even need a screen.\u00a0 You would be able do to do anything that you do on\u00a0\u00a0 the smartphone directly from your Apple Watch. So definitely keep an oeye on core ml, which is\u00a0\u00a0 apples machine learning framework, because it\u2019s\u00a0 only a matter of time when they add the latest\u00a0\u00a0 transformer models and stable diffusion. A book that I am reading on Edge\u00a0\u00a0 AI is called AI at the edge. And finally, I am learning web development. \u00a0 The most important takeaway that I have\u00a0 discovered over the last few years of AI\u00a0\u00a0 development is that around 95% of all\u00a0 AI projects also require some form of\u00a0\u00a0 user interface to monitor or run the model. It is very rare nowadays to encounter a project\u00a0\u00a0 that runs only on the backend without displaying\u00a0 any information. Moreover, the implementation of\u00a0\u00a0 such backend projects is already handled by\u00a0 products like AutoML by Google, which allow\u00a0\u00a0 anyone to upload their data and create a machine\u00a0 learning model without any ai expertise. \u00a0 So, especially with generative AI, I believe\u00a0 that the success of your project relies more\u00a0\u00a0 heavily on the convenience of your user interface\u00a0 rather than on the performance of your model. \u00a0 And the most ubiquitous way to allow\u00a0 anyone to interact with your model,\u00a0\u00a0 is of course through the browser. Just think about. \u00a0 Anything that has a screen nowadays also\u00a0 has a browser, even my ebook does. So it\u00a0\u00a0 only makes sense to develop UIs where most\u00a0 people will be able to access them. \u00a0 I am constantly keeping an eye on all the\u00a0 latest web frameworks to check if any of\u00a0\u00a0 them release any exciting features, however,\u00a0 for now, I am mostly focusing on Next.js,\u00a0\u00a0 which is a framework built on top of React. The best resource for web development is of\u00a0\u00a0 course YouTube, where you can find thousands\u00a0 of free courses or project walkthroughs. \u00a0 Additionally, for simpler user interfaces,\u00a0 you can leverage Python libraries like\u00a0\u00a0 Streamlit and Gradio, which are sometimes\u00a0 more than enough for internal projects. \u00a0 For more details check out my last\u00a0 video in the description on how\u00a0\u00a0 to build your first ai driven web app. So, as you might have noticed I mostly learn\u00a0\u00a0 technologies that help me to integrate existing AI\u00a0 solutions, rather than build AI from scratch. \u00a0 There is no way I could possibly train a more\u00a0 powerful model than what openai provides,\u00a0\u00a0 but what I could do however, is help businesses\u00a0 leverage openai drive growth and profits. \u00a0 And yes, data privacy is often a\u00a0 major concern with such projects,\u00a0\u00a0 but if you go to Microsoft Azure, you can find\u00a0 out that their OpenAI service actually does\u00a0\u00a0 not even share data with OpenAI itself. This means that you would be running OpenAI\u00a0\u00a0 models just like if you were hosting any other\u00a0 open-source model, which is what most companies\u00a0\u00a0 concerned with privacy still revert to. And if you curious on why I personally think\u00a0\u00a0 it makes no sense to learn ai development itself,\u00a0 make sure to watch this video next, where I will\u00a0\u00a0 share a lot more insights and useful takeaway\u00a0 from my personal experience in this field. \u00a0 Thank you for watching, and\u00a0 don't forget to subscribe.",
