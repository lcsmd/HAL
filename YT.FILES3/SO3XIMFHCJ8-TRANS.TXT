  "transcript": "we are back with another episode of systems thinking so I've been listening to a bunch of podcasts uh with other people who are ostensibly systems thinkers although many of them don't say it out loud uh that's part of the mission of this channel is I want to basically say hey systems thinking is a thing and let's define what it is and how to practice it so after listening to some of these podcasts um I'm not going to say which one uh but they were talking about zeroth principal thinking and that led me back down the rabbit hole of the energy principle and that sort of stuff and all of this just kind of fell into place it clicked all at once for me and so that is the inspiration that is the Genesis behind this video where I will kind of unpack all of the different uh skills and things that you can practice to build systems thinking as an intuition and so while systems thinking is something that you can consciously do you can you can there are many many techniques out there um I've talked about some of them in my channel such as you know using lists and tax iies in order to uh you know bring structure to whatever it is that you're working on but most of what your brain does is unconscious and so what you need to do is you actually need to build those systems thinking muscles in the unconscious part of the mind so that you have systems thinking intuitions and so that is kind of what the focus of uh today's video is on and I know I say 10 ways to practice but it's 10 plus is because some of these some of these ideas are interrelated so let's get into it so first is the free energy principle which if if you haven't heard of the free energy principle this is a theory about how uh particularly intelligent animals like humans kind of navigate the world and the idea is that you're trying to minimize free energy or the the dissonance between your expected State and the actual state that you receive and so this is why you know when you have little children they you know constantly toddle around and they poke at things and they fall down and get hurt um because they don't have enough World Experience they don't have enough training data to be able to fully anticipate what's going to happen if they you know run Full Tilt off you know off of a sidewalk and you know face first into a bench I've seen that happen at at a theme park um and then of course they fall down and they start crying because the expected sensory input was just wind on the face and then they have a you know bruise on their forehead um so that is an example that is a very simple example of the free energy principle but it illustrates kind of what what it is that that the theory is in terms of how we go about learning now of course that is just physically navigating the world but there are plenty of other ways in which this can apply so for instance when you do a math equation um what you expect to get and the kind of the sensations that you expect to have as you're solving the math equation versus that Eureka signal that unique brain wave that happens when you've actually solved the problem or when you're navigating complex social situations so on and so forth and so basically we're constantly trying to reduce our margin of error um between expected results results and observed results and in that respect our brain is kind of a differential engine um it's a prediction engine it's an anticipation engine and the smarter you are the better able you are to to accurately predict or model what will happen um further into the future and with greater accuracy and you also able to better recognize when your expectation wasn't met or when you didn't have an expectation in the first place because like what's the difference between us and like a slug a slug doesn't have any real expect it's just going to keep going until until its sensory mil changes until its sensorium mask changes and it's like ah now I'm in a place that has food and water again okay cool it's not really doing much planning it doesn't really have much expectations for the future it's just operating on Instinct and to be fair a lot of humans can operate on Instinct most of the time anyways we fall back on default patterns you know it's like you kind of go about your day until oh I feel hungry I feel thirsty or whatever and so that is an example uh some examples of what I mean by the free energy principle and this really speaks to one understanding your own brain because your brain doesn't come with a user manual so a big part of systems thinking is understanding your own brain and how it works um and then once you understand the rules once you kind of develop your own user manual then of course you can use it better say the way that I think of it is the human brain is like a Ferrari it's very powerful but unless you're a skilled driver you can you know go really fast in the wrong direction or straight into a wall um and so just like a Ferrari just like a jet fighter it takes akes time to learn how to use that brain and you have to understand the principles and behaviors and laws of physics and everything else that underpin how your brain works so this is a foundational idea to systems thinking all right and so this leads to active inference so just taking a quick look at this cartoon you can actively infer that this man has forward momentum and he's just realized that he has made a grievous life uh Choice mistake and is about to fall off of a cliff this is active inference you um understand what is going on in the scene and so does the man and you can infer that he knows because of his his expression so active inference is a uh is a consequence or a result of the free energy principle or they can be seen as kind of uh convergent research convergent theories uh on how we explore the world and so instead of just reacting because again going back to the example of the slug the slug is mostly just reacting to sensory input and Instinct um you know if the weather changes if it gets too cold it might go find somewhere to hide if it gets too warm it's going to find somewhere cool so on and so forth but humans with our big brains and our our brains with models of the world we can look at a thing and say oh we can anticipate what's about to happen next and so then what happens is you actively infer kind of the next few events whether you know what you expect to see feel hear so on and then if that expectation is met your brain says aha I accurately predicted this however if you're wrong then your prediction was whatever model you used or whatever intuitions you used you selected the wrong ones and you'll get a little signal saying hm that's not what I expected and this is actually the Bedrock of Comedy um comedy actually only works by virtue of the fact that we can inter we can infer things we can anticipate things and then it comes down to timing and thwarting those expectations and so the the simplest definition of Comedy that I've ever heard is you give the audience not what they expect like outside of what they expected but within the Realms of what they would tolerate which is why comedians often Bank on really unexpected things sometimes grotesque things sometimes sexual because it's something that's just outside of what would be socially expected but it's still within what is socially acceptable in that context but the fact of the matter is that it's unexpected and humor is one way that we can react to unexpected events such as by laughing but we can also react poorly to unexpected events like if you stub your toe on the on a door um then you're going to probably you know like be be angry at the door or whatever uh but so this is this is uh active inference and this is also part of kind of understanding how the brain works and these two ideas speak to much of the rest of the video so that's why I led with these okay so it shouldn't come as a surprise especially if you've watched my channel for a while I talk about cognitive distance often enough I have come to believe that cognitive dissonance is the actual sensation of these collisions so what I I mean by a collision is when something that you expect collides with something that you actually get um now that could be an observation out in reality it could also be as you're playing with ideas and models inside your own head and so everyone is by now familiar with cognitive dissonance I probably don't need to explain it to you um but whether you have conflicting ideas beliefs observations it can be entirely internal it can also be you know your internal model clashing with what you're getting from the outside world and a lot of commentators on you know the internet especially in this post-truth era that we're in actually really Bank on cognitive dissonance and so we as a culture have arrived at a place where we pathologize co cognitive dissonance it's like oh you have cognitive dissonance because you're not reconciling these ideas um and sometimes that's projection but really what cognitive dissonance is just take yourself out of the modern context and put yourself in the shoes or you know cloth of a primordial human a protohuman like a you know hi highle beinus or Neanderthal where you don't have you know Tucker Carlson on the internet where you don't have internet at all and what does cognitive dissonance serve in that case in that case you might say okay I found a really great stick that's going to make a good Spear and so the you you say okay this stick is nice and strong and straight and it's very sturdy and it's heavy it feels good it's got some good heft and so then you go to sharpen the stick and you know find major superpower that we use it's it's how our brain calls attention to when our active inference was wrong cognitive dissonance is the process of reconciliation in the free energy principle now in a large complicated world where a lot of people don't have media literacy where they don't have data literacy when they don't have um you know they're not aware of what propaganda is and they're not aware that there are you know computer algorithms actively trying to manipulate them a lot of people get taken in by conspiracy theories they get taken in by um you know identity stacking or identity politics they get suckered into various epistemic tribes that have different relationships with energy or information but cognitive dissonance is still a fundamentally human thing and then each of these cultures that you might find yourself in has a different relationship with cognitive dissonance how do you resolve cognitive dissonance in some cases people have refined the art of you know leading people into certain verbal traps there's you know the Bailey M uh rhetorical tactic um but all of these rhetorical tactics are Bas are based on cognitive failures um or cognitive biases but in in many cases people use these kinds of ways of defeating their own cognitive dissonance a really great example is um conspiracies like flat earthers where they concoct very very complex worldviews to explain that why the Earth is flat because they take as an axent they take as a first principle the Earth is flat and then so then every other observation that clashes with that they need to construct a very complex framework logical framework in order to justify that belief now what often happens when people have these conspiratorial beliefs there will be some point of fracture where the the whole house of cards because it really is a house of cards comes tumbling down but cognitive dissonance and pointing out the cognitive dissonance and basically telling people hey the way to alleviate this cognitive dissonance is to accept the truth of the matter um this is how we work to we work towards um converging on global truths and of course the internet is really big and we humans barely have evolved off of the savanas um so it's complicated for us we're not that good at it yet um but we are equipped with this neurological feat of cognitive dissonance and so the point of having this in the video is just pointing out that cognitive dissonance is actually your superpower so in some of these podcasts that I talk to or that I listen to um one of the things that they that they talk about is having curiosity as your primary thing not winning you know not being the best Democrat not being the best you know Republican not being you know if your if your entire worldview is you know sticking it to the libs then you're not orienting yourself towards the truth and the best way to orient yourself towards the truth is through curiosity which means that whenever cognitive dissonance arises you respond to that cognitive dissonance with curiosity and you say what did I get wrong here um and it's a really simple idea but cognitive dissonance is a superpower it's not to be pathologized it's not something to be demonized or you know you whip it out as a gacha card when you're you know listening to debates or whatever um and this is honestly why I don't listen to most commentators uh political commentators anymore is because um and here's a primary example go watch the Don Lemon Elon Musk debate there is so much cognitive dissonance on both sides and neither of them are engaging with it responsibly um so like in that respect they're both kind of idiots um because and and what I will say is that Elon Musk is far more consistent than Don Lemon was um they're both wrong so yeah I want I want the world to be more comfortable with cognitive dissonance and to recognize that it is a superpower and treat it as such so next up is distillation so distillation is something that I talk about often and this is the process of iterative refinement of knowledge basically boiling stuff down into its most quintessential simplest form um and what happens when you do this is that once you extrapolate the most universal principles or the most uh essential aspects of anything it tends to be more portable and so from a neurological perspective this is um this allows you to form more analogies or it allows you to form more inductive reasoning or more generalizations now there is of course such a thing as a hasty generalization but if you if you as long as you keep in mind that a generalization is not going to be perfect and most are not um that's fine and so an example of a distillation um that I that I really like is um what I came up with as the purpose of Education the purpose of education is to help students reach their maximum potential that is a distilled definition of what is the purpose of education and and you might say okay well but what about x y and z um because this definition is very portable because it of it allows for being applied to any number of educational paradigms whether their maximum potential is in a Jesuit school or their maximum potential is in an engineering school or whether their maximum potential is in a dance studio whatever um but the purpose of education is to help students reach their maximum potential that is the most distilled definition of Education um that I could come up with and how do you do this um it's I want I don't want to say that it's complicated and then just like wave it away um but understanding that distillation is a thing that you can do and that you can practice um and you can build this intuition um distillation is also relevant to First principles thinking and also zeroth principles thinking both of which we'll go over in a second um but this is also a cognitive skill it is something that you can practice and so like you know what you can do is you can go onto a chatbot or you know write it down on pen and paper and you just write down a definition you say okay does this cover the definition well enough is it distilled enough and it's sort of basically uh Socratic dialogue with yourself um and Socratic dialogue is kind of you know poking holes like okay does it apply in all situations no yes where does it apply now one one thing I want to uh urge caution against is don't fall into the postmodernist Trap where just because a definition is not perfect and Universal you throw it out categorically um you need to be able to hold some dissonance some uh some variability in your brain to say okay I haven't fully reconciled definition but this is the good enough definition that I've got right now um because postmodernism basically says ah well you can't come up with a perfect definition so the entire thing is categorically false and useless um which is really immature and I'm not sure why postmodernism really became the status quo except that it's really edgy and lazy um and so a lot of underqualified pedestrian thinkers are able to engage in postmodernist thought you can tell how I feel about postmodernism okay so next is first principles thing as promised first principles thinking so first principles is basically you just go back to the back to the drawing board you go back to what does the basic math tell us in most cases first principal thinking is looking at it from a purely like the simplest most childish mathematical uh principles um it's not always math um but math is often a good place to start and so an example of this is um if you watch my interview um earlier on this channel where I interviewed the the uh the the engineer who helped design the original gigafactory there's industrial engineering and Industrial design which is basically okay what is the big biggest throughput we can get with a particular building and um how do you calculate that you say okay well all the machines that we have take up this much volume um and they need to be arranged in this way and so you just look at the numbers okay a building of this many cubic feet with this much floor space should be able to house this many production lines and therefore it should have this much output the ability to mathematically model what you expect so again going back to the free energy principle a mathematical model or you know a theory or a projection um that is a that is an example of what you expect to get and then you say okay how do we make reality match our model and in the in that case U the prime stakeholder his intuition was correct and the engineers were able to figure out how to squeeze the most productivity possible out of that building now first principles thinking is not always math there are psychological first principles there are ecological first principles there are rhetorical and philosophical first principles thinking so an example of a philosophical first principle is what ontological container do you believe we live in and so an ontological container is your fundamental model of what is the universe everything that you see feel hear everything that we can measure that is the ontological container that we exist in is it a holographic Universe it is is it a simulated universe is it um all contained in the dream of a god um is the is the ontological container fundamentally math um and so that is an example of a first principle of okay for any discussion what interpretation of reality are you using is it the Copenhagen interpretation is it the you know the hinduist interpretation so that's an example of a first principles thinking from a philosophical perspective and of course your philosophy in inexorably uh intersects with science with Society with psychology um all of these things they once you zoom out enough and and you're a a powerful enough system Syer you'll realize that they're all o they all overlap um because again whatever fundamental assumptions you're making about the Universe um will have Downstream impacts on assumptions that you make about say the human brain and the human spirit and whether or not we have a soul whether or not there can be life after death and of course some people say no I'm purely a scientist and there's no scientific evidence for that well I will quote um uh Aubrey from Master and Commander not everything is in your books um and and the the most humble scientists will tell you I don't know they're like I don't know how it would be possible but I don't know because um good scientists will remember that science is an expanding sphere there is a there is a maximum size of science which is once we know everything about everything but science is still very small we do not know everything about everything and um that is also a first principle to keep in mind okay so as promised also zeroth principal thinking so there's a lot of people that don't really like it and I don't really like this term either but after hearing other people talk about it I realize there is some utility in using this term and so I picked a goldfish for this image because there's a um there's a there's a proverb I don't know where it came from um but the the proverb goes you may as well ask the fish if the water is wet and so to a fish the world has always been wet and it doesn't really know anything else unless it jumps out of its goldfish bowl and is you know flopping around and dying of of getting dehydrated and and basically suffocating um and but to you and me unless you are familiar with getting in the water to you the world is not really wet unless it's raining on you and so the uh the lesson here you know may as well ask the fish if the water is wet is basically saying what fundamental assumptions are you making about everything because you've never had another experience there's a line in Dune part two where uh where um Paul and Chie are sitting on a dune and and Chie says does it really does water really fall from the sky where you where you're from and he said oh yeah like it rains a lot um and then and then we also have oceans we have so much water that all the sand that you see imagine that that's water and channie can't comprehend that because she's only ever seen water come from bodies and you know they have their sacred pool and so that is a that is a basically a reverse example of may as well will ask the fish if the water is wet you know it's like ma will ask the femin if the sand is dry actually like that one um and so because because you lack experience because you have not personally had an experience of something you have all these implied beliefs about how the world works and so Zero's principal thinking is unpacking all of that say like what what what fundamental assumptions am I making about everything because of my personal lived experience um and then uh unpacking that can lead to new insights now Socratic dialogue is a basically a battle of two minds where you say um you can look at you can think of it as in modern as like kind of a a generative adversarial Network where you have one network that's trying to make an assertion and the other one trying to prove it wrong um or trying to you know exploit it or whatever um a friend of mine who's in machine learning research he's in reinforcement learning he has one where it's basically like a machine version of Socrates or Socratic dialogue where he has one model that's trying to Build a Better World of the model and the other one is trying to make it sad it's trying to prove it wrong um and those are his words he wants one model to make the other one sad um by pointing out hey you're wrong over here and so Socratic dialogue is the human version of generative adversarial networks where you say hey I I said this thing and then someone else comes along and says well how do you know like but what about this other thing um it can be very infuriating because it's basically professional whataboutism um but this also allows you to point out or to to discover where you have cognitive dissonance where it's like hey you haven't reconciled these two ideas like you have this belief and you have this belief how do you reconcile them that is the point of Socratic dialogue and this is actually where um where human brains are intrinsically social and this is why we often come up with better decisions after having conversations with people um particularly people that are qualified one thing that I will say is the internet allows a lot of people to believe that they're good at debating most people are not um you need to have a baseline uh common understanding and common framework of how to approach problems in order for it to be a valuable or valid debate but at the same time um having one mind go against another and you can you we we call this like steel Manning today so steel Manning is kind of like the modern Socratic dialogue where it's like okay for the sake of argument I'm going to take the opposite stance that I would Norm take to give them the benefit of the doubt um and you see this happening more and more in podcasts um and even uh so I on my main Channel I actually had a recent it wasn't a debate but it was with an investigative journalist who's more afraid of AI than I am and he kind of took this he's like okay well you say this why do you believe that um like let's let's fully unpack this um and you know it was because we were coming at it from a very similar uh epistemic perspective we had the same goal I was like yes you're right let's unpack this and so it doesn't necessarily have to be adversarial or hostile um and that is another thing that I would really like to see change in the internet today is that you can have a debate that is not adversarial you can have a debate that is not hostile the point of a debate is to elucidate all the arguments for the audience it's not about proving who's right or wrong it's about elucidating all the arguments anyways I'll get off my Soap Box math skills so this came up um this has come up repeatedly in both the ments and in my webinars um and so basically people ask like Dave what should we what should we study if AI is going to come through and invalidate everything that we uh think we know think that we're good at math is something that I think we should always study and the primary reason is because math gives you new ways of approaching the world not only is it it's not just intellectual it's not just ah I have a new intellectual tool it physically changes your brain um math and reading are two skills that physically and fundament m al change the wiring of your brain and so it's like you should do it anyways you should also do computer programming which I'll talk about in a minute because it also forces your brain to use logic differently and so developing math skills um is one of the best ways to also develop systems thinking um all of these things that I'm telling you are ways to develop your your systems thinking intuitions um but math is one of the um biggest ways to uh structurally retrain your brain and it's um I I can't remember the name of the brain r but it's it's the thing that runs right along here it it's the part of the brain that handles Visos spatial information that structure gets co-opted and that's what that's where math is learned in your brain um and because it's like okay so Visos spatial let's add numbers let's add math um it's suspected actually that that Einstein actually had a mutation that changed that shape and that's why he was so good at theoretical math so not everyone has to be Einstein but if you think think of it this way you take two people one person has never learned any math and another person has you know gone up through you know Cal 3 those people are going to have fundamentally different mental abilities uh when it pertains to systems thinking and when it pertains to modeling the world I remember a good friend of mine um was a math whz and he went to go work at an industrial place and he had a spool it was a I think it was a spool of film or something it was film likee and so he needed to estimate how much film was on the roll so he said okay the thickness of the film is this the diameter of the spool is this and he was able to use um was it not differentials I don't remember but he told me how he calculated and he and he was able to very accurately estimate how much film was on this reel and someone's like how did you do that he's like it's just math um but because he had that ability he has a fundamentally different way of approaching problems in the world and that is a very powerful underpinning ability for systems thinking and again part of the the the whole point of this video is developing those um those systems thinking intuitions at the unconscious level and math is one of the best ways to do that and then as uh as promised computer programming so here we have a python learning python um computer programming particularly well any language really but the forcing you to to use formal logic and to think procedurally and also to think abstractly about okay what are all the components of this machine doing um it doesn't strictly have to be computer programming Can it can be any level of systems engineering um any level of computer networking because computers are all very deterministic machines and heck I mean it doesn't even have to be computers as far as I am concerned you can be a mechanic um but the idea is that you're learning how P pieces and parts interlock and intersect with each other how energy and information flows across a system or across a network um and so this procedural thinking the systems design um building complex systems you can even do it with Legos if you want um it's all the same to me um but the idea is that learning to use formal logic likewise in the same way that learning to read and learning to do math it causes changes in your brain that allows you to think about the world differently um so computer programming math skills um but and of course you might say Okay Dave that's all stem and I'm glad you asked because also fiction um as a writer as a as a as a science fiction author this is one of the best ways to practice zero principle thinking and this is why like whenever I hear people like Zero's principal thinking is the way to go and I'm like what do you mean because then when they actually describe it I'm like you're just talking about what authors do where it's you create you very deliberately set up a world where it's like hey let me question literally every assumption that I'm making about the way that the world Works um like you know you can do uh maybe we have people that live underwater okay if you have an underwater civilization what all does that entail um or you know if we're going to go live on the moon what what do that single assumption change about how we approach the world how do our mental models work and of course our mental models are never perfect which is why you know you go back and you know read Jules Vern 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea or you know from the earth to the moon or whatever authors are not necessarily scientists or Engineers but we often also get some things sometimes our intuitions are better than not um but the point is is that if you engage with speculative fiction writing or reading um one of my physicists actually both of my physicist friends are huge huge sci-fi nerds one is a writer like me um but they love love love the zeroth principal thinking where it's like hey let me just toss out all of the Baseline assumptions that I'm making about reality and adopt a different model of thinking and so whether you whether you just read speculative fiction or you write it I will say that writing speculative fiction and World building is O that is that is a that is an entire discipline unto itself um but it helps helps speak to all of these other abilities and the ability to imagine you know zeroth principle whatever you know reorganizing everything and so you combine that creativity um with the stem field such as math and programming um and that is how you become a better systems thinker like me um and then I think this is the last one is theory of mind or no this is the second last one theory of mind and so humans we have all kinds of abilities we have mirror neurons which allow us to empathize with other people going back to the at the beginning of the episode the uh the dude who was about to walk off a cliff you could see this surprise on his face um theory of mind is the ability to understand the content and operation in another brain um this is uh this is a critical ability for us as a social species where you say okay this person lied to me because why um here's how we test it or this person um is my friend and I can trust them because of these reasons um that sort of thing now this ability is one it's a it's a neurological superpower and it is also different in everyone because some people have better theory of Mind than others some people for many people it's um it's automatic and intuitive so this is what you might call affective empathy where they just kind of magically seem to know what other people are thinking and feeling and other people such as us neuros spicy systems thinkers it is cognitive um empathy which is we develop models so that we can um deliberately think through and we say ah I know what you're thinking because of these patterns so so it's basically like do you feel it or do you recognize the patterns is an oversimplification but I think you get the idea um point is is if you're a human who has a marginally functional brain you have theory of mind um and this is something that can be developed and understanding human brains and being able to model human brains one is just a super useful social and uh relational skill but also when you understand that that all systems are human systems like yes systems thinking can involve machine and programming and that sort of stuff um but you also realize that all systems intrinsically interact with humans theory of Mind becomes a very very powerful way of understanding how the world Works um I'm always talking about the status game um so if you want to have a really good model about how like kind of the social operating system that exists in all human brains across the entire planet read the status game um and if you read only one book about psychology read that one uh but anyways point is is that that model again going back to the free energy principle the better you understand humans and the human system and the human brain the less surprised you will be by humans um and therefore the better your models of everything else will be that involve humans which of course everything that we do involves humans um unless you're an astrophysicist and you're studying black holes on the other side of the Galaxy um yes so then the finally is be a polymath um there is this weird thing where a lot of people feel like they're not allowed to dabble in other disciplines I suspect that it has to do with the way that Academia is which is very protective and defensive and there's all kinds of structural reasons for this um which I'm not going to get into because I can rant for probably hours on all the problems with modern Academia but books no nobody can gatekeep books you look behind me I have a whole bunch of books that are written by phds and medical doctors and people with Decades of experience and so like I have several thousand years of expertise on the on the bookshelf behind me nobody can gatekeep that and you also don't need a PhD or a formal education in order to be uh to have interdisciplinary interests um but cross trining this is scientifically proven cross trining your brain has uh multiplicative benefits in other words um the when you diversify your brain when you're well-rounded you do better than um than anyone in either discipline and so typically the way that you can balance it is you can have something that's more stem and then more creative because those exercise different muscles in the brain and so uh basically like pretty much everyone who's been a great thinker or has moved uh the you know moved the ball down the field intellectually they often have a creative hobby uh either they are creative um and then they have like an intellectual hobby so like even Marilyn Monroe was an intellectual um she loved reading but she was also you know a model and an actress um then likewise uh Fran cholle who is um who was who kind of led the charge with deep learning um his work kind of set the stage for Transformer architecture that we have today he's a painter um and so whatever it is that your your primary thing is you should counterbalance that with the opposite so stem and then creativity um or you know math and science and then you know arts and and creativity and Humanities over here you need both um and and also the more well-rounded you are the more disciplines you you dip into like someone once called me a delaton not a polymath and I'm like whatever I'll take it um uh there's nothing wrong with being a delaton there's nothing wrong with being a A polymath or a dabbler or whatever but the more well-rounded you are the better your brain is and I would say that my success here on YouTube is like the proof is in the pudding so anyways that is um 10 plus is ways that you can practice your systems thinking intuition so thanks for watching I hope you got a lot out of it let me know in the comments um what you want me to follow up on what what parts of this resonated um what needs to be unpacked more so",
