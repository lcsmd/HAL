  "transcript": "aways they can be intimidating and fighting a violation might seem like almost an impossible task but you do have rights and the state even has a dispute process you can use if you feel you're being treated unfairly and tonight investigator Joe Ducey let you know what to do if you take on your HOA and a lot of people round up about this one open the floodgates the calls and the emails there's some good uh HOA Boards out there and some good HOAs I think that I don't hear about those I hear about the other ones and if you've got issues uh you have rights like seeing your hoa's financial documents and knowing how your fees are being spent and you have the right to fight back if you feel you're being mistreated knowing your ccnrs is crucial because they're the neighborhood rule rule fight back Kathleen dorario went head-to-head with her HOA board we found out that the president turned in receipts for items that he purchased in New Jersey she says she and her neighbors are getting hit with violations and no explanation why she wanted to know where all that money was going so she asked for receipts what she found was shocking I mean they bought laundry detergent and and almonds and by wipes and and every just about every time they bought air fresheners support has been recalled the board was later ousted first things first if there's a fine pay it I know it sounds backwards but not paying gives them reason to tack on a lot of ridiculous charges start talking to your neighbors chances are if you've received a bogus notice so have they they don't need their support to change bylaws and get rid of board members and attending your HOA meeting should be a priority you need to know who the board members are and how they operate you know many times a fighting your HOA ends up in court unfortunately but the state does have a little known dispute process you can use through the department of all things fire building and safety it's costly 550 bucks but that's less than you'd probably pay for an attorney and it doesn't keep you from going to court if you're not happy with their decision go to abc15.com let you know for more information about that dispute process and if you need my help you can email me call me or find me on Facebook or Twitter and bring those HOA problems on I don't assume the more stories that we could do on that silly these some of these things winding up in court though because they're over on garbage can or the color of your door or whatever inevitably that's where it ends up and costs a lot of money for the people again thanks",
