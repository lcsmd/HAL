  "transcript": "the World Health Organization made a prediction there will be a mental health pandemic but this is not something that has to happen if you want to fix this you need to sad Guru one of the most viewed gurus in the world his mission is to raise every human being to the peak of their potential who has built one of the largest nonprofit organizations in the world we have more than any other generation ever had in terms of Comforts and Technologies yet we are miserable people you want to be something more all the time that's why you suffer just tell me is there one thing that human beings are not suffering somebody's poor they suffer their poverty somebody becomes rich they suffer the taxes if they're not married they suffer get married I don't have to say anything you're making up a purpose to bring some meaning to your life but if you try to enhance your activity without enhancing yourself you'll only die of stress what about trauma you're finding an excuse for the way you are which you yourself don't like if something unpleasant happened to you you have two choices either you can become wise or you can become wounded your experience of life is determined by you if your happiness depends on what happens on the outside you being happy is a remote possibility I want to be happy what's step one there is a simple practice which only take 21 minutes and this is when human beings can do something absolutely fantastic first thing is I just want to start this episode with a message of thanks a thank you to everybody that Tunes in to listen to this podcast by doing so you've enabled me to live out my dream but also for many members of our team to live out their dreams too it's one of the greatest privileges I could never have dreamed of or imagined in my life to get to do this to get to learn from these people to get to have these conversations to get to interrogate them from a very selfish perspective trying to solve problems I have in my life so I feel like I owe you a huge thank you for being here and for listening to these episodes and for making this platform what it is can I ask you a favor I can't tell you how much um you can change the course of this podcast the the course of the guests were able to invite to the show and to the course of everything that we do here just by doing one simple thing and that simple thing is hitting that subscribe button helps this channel more than I could ever explain the guests on this platform are incredible because so many of you have hit that button and I know when we think about what we want to do together over the next year on this show a lot of it is going to be fueled by the amount of you that are subscribed and that tune into this show every week so thank you let's keep doing this and I can't wait to see what this year brings for this show for us as a community and for this [Music] platform what is the the mission that you're on well today you know a few months ago the wh or the World Health Organization made a prediction that there is going to be a mental health pandemic at least 5 years ago none of us knew what is a pandemic today we all know what is a pandemic and they've gone further and they said the next stage is there will be a suicide pandemic just to put it in perspective in 2020 when the pandemic was in full swing all over the world in Japan more people died of suicide than of the pandemic so we don't really need the virus that's all I'm saying because the virus has gotten into our head because once survival is taken care of you if you did do not become conscious the way you sit stand breathe think emote and function within yourself if it does not become conscious you will naturally head downhill this is just September 23rd I completed 40 Years of this work so 40 years ago I was a young man one afternoon when I had nothing much to do somehow an hour and a half Gap was there for me in the work I was working like morning 530 in the morning to 11: in the night building various kinds of businesses around me so when I got a break there's a small hill this hill is a place where we go and for the Youth when I was a kid I cycled up this hill we camped on this hill we parted on this hill if you want to test our motorcycles we went up the hill just about anything you want to do the youth go to chamundi Hill this is the thing I just walked up and sat on a rock my eyes were still open I thought it's just 10 15 or 20 minutes suddenly I started feeling every cell in my body literally dripping ecstasy I thought this lasted 15 20 minutes but when I came back to my normal senses 4 and a half hours had passed for the first time in my adult life tears me and tears were simply impossible tears to a point my shirt is all wet then I shake my skeptical mind and ask what the hell is happening to me all I knew was I had hit a gold mind and there was no context nobody around me could tell me what was happening with me nor did I know what was happening with me this is something that most people will experience in their lives on a certain day when they're very happy 24 hours feels like 10 minutes another day when you're depressed 10 minutes will feel like 24 hours time is a very relative experience when you're so blissed out what is 2 minutes it's 8 hours 10 hours just gone like that so in about 6 to 8 weeks I came to some kind of stabilization Within Myself and started experimenting as to what is happening to me then I realized if I keep a little distance from my physiological and psychological activity that's going on if I just remove myself a little bit then within within a few seconds or within a couple of minutes every cell in my body is bursting with ecstasy now this is not just my experience today we have it measured out in Howard Medical School how there is endoc cannabites are bursting out in people simply because they do a simple practice so I made a plan in 2 and 1 half years time I will make the whole world blissed out I knew the methodology if you just keep a distance it'll happen 40 years now today people are saying we are touching over two billion people last year our video views have been 3.51 billion so people think that's great but no that is less than half the population as far as I'm concerned because I started thinking I'll make the whole world blissed out but people are committed to their miseries either because of their beliefs or their ideologies or their compulsive Behavior within themselves so it needs to happen to the whole world this is I don't see this as a mission I just see this as an expression of my Humanity suppose you hear a good joke will you tell somebody who's dear to you or will you cover yourself with a blanket and tell yourself of course I'd tell everybody yeah pretend it was mine that's all I'm trying to do no Mission my experience I'm trying to just rub it off on people some stats for you that support what you said earlier someone dies by suicide in the UK every 90 minutes 76% of them are male the single biggest cause of death for men under the age of 45 here in the UK is by Suicide you said you spent a lot a lot of time around business people and they appear to be the most unhappy and least Blissful people I wouldn't say unhappy stressed out stressed out what is it that we're doing to the because I I see myself I must be in that category to some regard because I've focused most of my time on you know building businesses and you know I guess to some extent material things and SU ESS so I must be part of that that is a diversionary tactic in the sense so you can think that survival means 2 Ms a day or you can think survival means bentle so it'll keep you busy a little longer still survival process as long as the survival there's an instinct of survival and there is a longing to expand within the human being so for most human beings these two things are mixed up it is their Instinct of survival which is finding expression as their longing to expand so it doesn't matter who you are where you are anybody you want to be something more if that's something more happens you want to be something more you can go on like this how much more whatever you want if I make it true for you right now next moment you'll be thinking what more suppose I make you the king of not England the planet don't look at me hopefully I I will not commit such a blunder suppose we make you the king of this planet will you be fulfilled no you will look at the Moon you look at other planets you look at the other galaxies if I give you one Galaxy you'll say what about the other Galaxy because there is something within a human being which wants to expand limitlessly is that not a good thing it's not not the reason why I didn't I didn't say it's not good I'm just saying you have constipated that longing to expand that's why you suffer when I say constipated right now you want to expand limitlessly can you expand this body limitlessly no please don't don't try in the gym I've tried but so physical expansion is a limited expansion and your longing is to EXP and limitlessly because there is something within you which doesn't like boundaries the moment see if I imprison you in a 5x five cubicle you will feel terribly imprisoned then tomorrow I will announce your Liberation and release you into 10x 10 cubicle you will feel wonderful for two days then you will feel horribly imprisoned then we will release you into 100 by 100 cubicle you'll be fine for a week after that you'll feel miserable doesn't matter where where I set the boundary once you feel the boundary you want to break it so there is something intrinsic within you which doesn't like boundaries this is a consequence of the evolution that you've gone through once your cerebral cortex flowered now you don't like boundaries but you're trying to expand in an infinite Way by counting 1 2 3 4 5 can you ever count 1 2 3 4 5 when one day say infinity no you will only get into endless counting that's all that's happening that's why I said your longing to expand is a limitless process but right now you're constipated you're going one little step at a time constipation means just this it happens little by little so so is it a case of trying to find a balance between your ambition to expand and to grow and be successful and peace why should you find balance you must EXP expand okay so that's what I'm doing yes no what is the means to become a boundless expansion if you look at that then we say Consciousness this is what raising human consciousness means because you realize physical expansion is not a realistic thing we can make physical arrangements as we want as we need for our convenience and comfort but that is not the way to expand expansion needs to happen in a way that it's not physical in nature then you can also own the Universe I can Al also own the universe when when I when I look at the way we're living our lives in the Western World what you talked about the who they describe stress as an epidemic sometimes and they say it's a major contributor to the diseases that we're undergoing um where I'm trying to figure out in my life where I'm going if there's anywhere where I'm going wrong because I've I'm building these businesses and I'm you know I sometimes ask myself to what end you know when you say where am I going wrong the wrong is this the fundamental wrong is this what is not you if you think it's you then you're trapped in that if you think that I am this chair because we sat on this chair for a period of time if you think you are this chair now this chair will go with you stuck to your backside wherever you go that's a very ugly thing to do isn't it it's the same thing right now your thought you think it's you your emotion you think it's you you physiological stuff you think it's you it's pretty ugly it's just because everybody's got this chair stuck to the backs side it looks like it's normal after all it's convenient wherever you go you don't have to look for a chair you got a chair fixed if I identify with all these things if I identify with this chair you'll saying that that becomes a way that's all the thing is your identity whatever you are identified with with that becomes a part of you and is that what's causing us a lot of our despair if you sit here just as life what is your problem as long as you alive everything is fine yeah the only problem is you're identified with things that you're are not so the whole lot of confusion about everything so if you're successful you suffer if you failure you suffer if you're see look at the thing is there one thing that human beings are not suffering just tell me somebody's poor they suffer their poverty somebody becomes rich they suffer the taxes no children they suffer that give them children every day pay something or the other so it looks like whole life is suffering so somebody makes a philosophy whole life is suffering you must go to heaven if you know that much why are you not gone you are not gone because you don't know a damn thing whether there is a place better than this somewhere or not you don't know you just claiming these things to somehow fix your psychological sloshing that's happening inside you're making up things to somehow believe something so that your psychology won't just splash all over the place and go crazy you're trying to hold yourself in place telling yourself fairy tals all right so what I'm saying is do you believe that if you want to navigate your life through this time that we have in a sensible manner the most important thing is to see life as is as it is if I don't see in this room things as they are I will walk into this table I will bump into somebody I will do crazy things every day if I see very clearly navigating myself through all these cables and tripods is not a big problem hello but if I don't see if there's no Clarity of vision if I'm not seeing things as they are then what a mess it is every little thing that's all the problem problem is not that what you're doing is wrong the way you're seeing it is wrong how do I how do I know the way I'm seeing it is wrong what is the evidence of that or the symptoms of that as you giving me the evidence from statistics that's the evidence MH so I am not like that obviously you're here I'm here so both of us didn't commit suicide so we are not in the statistic that's not the point you think those people who committed suicide everything was wrong with their life no not everything was wrong with their life a few things as it goes wrong in your life my life everybody's life some things don't work all right right in everybody's life something doesn't work in the outside world if everything is working for you obviously you're living a very Petty life in my life 95% of the things that I want doesn't happen only 5% happens because I'm trying to fix everything in the world most of the things don't happen so if anybody wants to die of frustration it must be me but I will not because no matter what I will die blessed out I live blessed out iish doubt because what I do what the situation is around me and how I am are never connected I'm the way I am I'll do my best has has it required you to train yourself to sort of disattach from it is no no no see uh this is all because see the problem is too much uh spiritual jargon is going all over the world because every idiot who's read two books can write her next book book if you read two books there was a time when people read 10 books and then wrote one book that was called plagarism now they read two books and they write the third book say your your background is full of books I hope you not read all of them I've only read two and I'm writing one uh because just about everybody is writing it's all right it's freedom of expression they can write what they want but these are two things there is expression and there is perception which should you invest in more perception if you perceive well your expression will be valuable right now everybody's on expression binge without perceiving a damn [Laughter] thing there will be so many people that are going through dress at work in their relationships in their household listening to this going how how do I live blissed out like he does like what what's step one in that staircase I'll tell you see whatever you call it you call it by whatever name you want stress anxiety tension depression bipolar this one that one many things I was talking to some of the top uh psychiatrists in UK and they told me there are 72 varieties of psychological ailments I thought they may be half a dozen but they said there are 72 varieties of psychological ailments I was really surprised 72 that's like a golf game you know then I asked what are these they told me quite a few things one of the things they told was compulsive nose picking even if they're bleeding in the nose they can't stop it that explains everything in a way compulsive nose picking leave the nose picking it's compulsiveness you're compulsive in your thought compulsive in your emotion compulsive in your actions that's all the problem is how do you fix compulsion compulsiveness if this room is dark how do you fix it let's do one thing both of us fight with this darkness and push it out of the window there's no such thing if you turn on the light it's gone so there is no substitute for Consciousness if you become conscious compulsive behavior is gone suppose you are in thought emotion action and energy you are not compulsive that you can create whatever thought you want whatever emotion you want would you keep yourself blessed out or miserable what's your choice blessed out for yourself every human being for themselves they want the highest level of pleasantness so the intent is already there you don't I don't have to inspire them be blissed out there's no such philosophy every human being wants the highest level of pleasantness for themselves those who think it's hopeless here they are the ones who created heaven they said there is a place which is always pleasant but they don't have any proof that we are all we are not already in heaven and making a mess out of that hello do you do you think this is happen this is planet Earth and it's a fantastic place and it's the most fantastic place we have seen in the known universe do you think there's Heaven though do you think there's somewhere else we go to that is another world after this one everybody who thinks there is one they must go today hello if they if they have better accommodation somewhere than London should they not go did people not rush to America at one time why are they not going no they want you to go this is not good true see whatever kind of mental ailment you talk about essentially when your intelligence turn against you there's no power in the universe which can help you but why is my intelligence turn turning against me somewhere we have not learned how to handle it isn't it MH your education systems your Society nowhere is there anything to teach a child how to handle their own intelligence their own emotions their own thoughts there is no such thing all fixing mechanic shop you know repair jobs everywhere leave the repair jobs the simple thing is this the reason why people are struggling with this is they have uh pardon my words but uh otherwise people won't get it they have a mental diarrhea this doesn't create create anything except distress anything that runs loose without your control is called diarrhea why has it happened even today even if somebody gets physical diarrhea immediately somebody will pop a pill but traditionally what did we do somebody has diarrhea first thing is we understood we have eaten something wrong first thing we did was just don't eat just drink water and wait and next identify what did I eat yesterday or today morning what happened to me what is it that I consumed which caused this and avoid that but now we will plug it in no if you plug it in it'll all rise within yourself this all that's happening right now our way of doing life is very forceful when I had mental diarrhea last time the last time I I had mental diarrhea that kind of overthinking causes anxiety all those things no no let me correct this there is no overthinking I'm saying people are not not thinking enough this is a serious problem but they think they're overthinking they are not overthinking it's a diarrhea it's happening why is it happening something wrong food has gone in what is the wrong food this is all it is the moment you identify yourself with something that you are not your mind you cannot stop do what you want do whatever you want it will not stop so that that anxiety that people experience where they start remunerating about the future or something that's happened that is because let me put it this way this this question I understand what you're saying see what is it that human beings are suffering what happened 10 years ago they're still suffering what may happen day after tomorrow they're already suffering this what you saying what happened 10 years ago is it here now does it exist no what may happen Day After Tomorrow does it exist here no so if you're suffering something that does not exist what does it mean tell me bluntly if you're suffering something that doesn't exist it's like insanity but it feels like it is insanity it is insanity that's why I'm saying once you start doing this how far you go when will you graduate when will you end up in a doctor's place when will you end up in Asylum is a question of time but now World bodies are predicting is going to happen large scale very soon let me give you an example so someone has a sick child or or they just lost their job and they're thinking over and over again about you know oh my God my child's going to die I'm going to lose my job and then I can't feed myself I'm going to lose my house then I'm going to be on the street that kind of remuneration and stress that that anxiety they experience on a day-to-day basis bis because they're scared of losing something which might you know they believe will end them up on the street or lose their job or they won't be able to feed their family that kind of Torment MH I wouldn't want to put those two things in the same level losing a child and losing a job all right losing a child is a different thing it's a completely different thing obviously there will be a certain amount of pain in any human being that's different so let say such a terrible thing we had to face that we may lose our child tell me can you do the best for the child if you are in your sanity or is it good to go into Insanity I feel like it takes a tremendous discipline now what it takes we'll see later but I'm just asking a fundamental question okay it well it makes more sense not to go into Insanity yes sanity will make a difference maybe we can save the child maybe we cannot because all aspects of life we don't determine our experience we can determine see what happens in the world around you even if you're just two people in the family never will it happen 100% your way if you try nobody will be around you it's as simple as that I've read your story so I know that there's moments in your life where you've lost people that you loved lot of people not one or two because my family is so large almost every other day I burying somebody who's very dear to me which one of those moments impacted you the most and did any of them drive you into the insanity that we're talking about no I don't let anything drive me into insanity this is a brief amount of time that you have as life here we create many things you're creating businesses I have large movements where millions of people are involved there are relationships you cannot take these things lightly because other lives are involved but you cannot prevent anybody from dying you can attend to them if if something is going to happen to them you can make attempts to save them but you cannot prevent anybody from absolutely dying including yourself this a fact so the only two things that we have is a certain amount of time and a certain amount of energy this is all that you call as life what do you want to make out of it you want to make a mess out of it see the thing is first of all they living an emotionally constipated life they only loved their child I saw everybody as mine everything that happen hurts but that's part of it if you walk in a forest there are thongs in your feet but but this doesn't mean you don't enjoy the forest all right do you have moments of sadness see you're asking a very question which is hard for me to say because I have done this to myself that nothing happens within me the way I don't want it if that was your situation nothing happens within you unconsciously everything that happens happens happens the way you want within yourself what is the experience that you want to have right now is always determined by you what would be your choice grief and misery is it no see you are the only creature who can decide your way of being no matter what is the surrounding every other creature is an instinctive reaction to what's happening around them because they are only fired by their survival Instinct they don't have any other aspiration once their stomach is full their life is settled for a human being stomach empty there's only one problem stomach full 100 problems because life doesn't settle with survival you want to be something else all the time the problem is you a being you're supposed to know how to be how far away have human beings gone from the definition or that aspiration so is an incorrect question to ask then because I asked you if you if you've you experience sadness if I want to I do if you want to you do okay I said it doesn't happen as it doesn't happen by itself if I want I can be loving if I want I can be joyful if I want I can be sad yes when somebody dear to you is no more you allow yourself that but do you stop doing anything no that sense of purpose you have the most popular question that young people ask me is is about passion and purpose they they've been indoctrinated by Society to think that they have this one purpose and their big issue is they can't seem to find it so like an Easter egg they they're going in Hunt of what's my purpose how do I know once I've reached my purpose for people that are working now in jobs um listening to this on their way on the tube to work how what is this this subject of purpose and passion what do I commit my life to how do we go about answering that see if you get absolutely committed to your purpose you will be called a fanatic if you are willing to do whatever it takes to achieve that you will be called a terrorist so there is no purpose to life if you if you are not a vested interest and you can be not a vested interest only when you're joyful by your own nature that how you are is determined by you so this is the fundamental you have to set that your experience of life is determined by you when I say experience of life people are always thinking experiences happen because of external stimuli no if you dream of a tiger you can experience fear isn't it you can you can dream of somebody beautiful and experience love yes or no so I'm saying all experiences cause from within you Human Experience happens from within you never from outside of you there may be a stimuli now this stimuli means just like this you know uh you're too young to know these things there used to be wax all cars in this country they always used to park it in a slope like this because morning you need two people to push that car in the morning in 50s and 60s I'm saying later on they had crank start you need one person person to do that otherwi you can't get your car started today all cars are self start I'm asking you your peace your joy your love your blissfulness would you want to keep it on self start or push out self I wouldn't want it to rely on this is the question you're asking repeatedly you want Push do don't be on pusht inner experiences are always in self start outside world will never happen 100% our way little bit your way a little bit my way a little bit somebody else's way and that's how it should be because everything happened your way where the hell do I go it doesn't happen your way or my way it's fine it is only fine if you're joyful by your own nature but if your happiness depends on what happens on the outside then you being happy is a remote possibility I want to be happy happy on my own nature I I hear what you said however I'm going to walk out of this room and I don't know something's going to annoy me maybe my words are even wrong but then I'll immediately snap back into the sort of unconscious I don't know dismay or despair how does one go about like the first step in becoming Happy by our own nature do you think your life is worthwhile your life is worth investing about 32 hours of focus time upon it your life yes if you think so you should do that this is what the process that I have called it as inner engineering 32 hours of focus time book is just a a large brocher you know because there is a practice involved when I say a practice a simple practice which only 21 minutes of practice to teach this 21 minute practice we take 32 hours of orientation because without that it won't happen you need to understand how the mechanism of your own thoughts why are they hit if your hand is punching you in the face why is it doing that you need to understand otherwise just holding it down is not the answer this is the most sophisticated machine on the planet have you read the users manual the users manual for my body for yourself as a life no I didn't know there was one so when do you want to do it towards the end of the life is when people think they should do it it's like you got yourself your iPad should you read the users manual in the first three days or after 3 years when you're getting rid of the machine when I first get it yes but nobody gives me the uses manual for for myself no no the thing is it's inbuilt you have to just pay attention how do I do that so we'll do one thing right now shall we do a simple experiment with this you'll have to do this with your eyes closed okay but right now look at me Dam afterward you can do you you place your palms like this facing down upon your thigh gently placed so you will start breathing slightly deeper 10 15% deeper than normal don't do it yet hello yeah and as you're doing it I will say switch then you turn your hands around gently upon your thigh like this and again when I say switch get back this way okay in these two conditions something about your breath will change I will also give you a clue what could be Chang changing where the air is filling up in your lungs how it fills up something about it will change or let me put it this way the maximum expansion and contraction in which part of the chest is it happening this way which way this way which way just notice that just hold your palms facing down close your eyes Okay and when you say switch turn my hands over right yes breathe slightly deeper not very forcefully just 10 15% more notice where the maximum expansion and contraction is happening switch switch again please open your eyes there's some difference yeah what is it uh in what part I feel how I feel no what I breathing where is the maximum expans T and contraction when you holding two different postures um I felt like my my chest and my belly were expanding more when I switch when I was switching I felt like I was just getting more air into my body let me tell you what's happening you can experiment by yourself and see when you have your hands facing together facing down with all fingers together maximum expansion contraction is happening in the lower low of the lung yeah yeah if you turn it around it shift to the middle Lo of the lung a middle Lo being much larger you feel more but actually it's the shift so I'm saying just by turning your hands around like this the very way you breathe is altering itself it's not just the breath the very way your life energy function is altering itself how many times in a day unconsciously are you now you're setting your energies into turmoil and hoping to be peaceful it will not work and I'm happy it doesn't work because if it works for you by doing wild things and still everything is peaceful and wonderful within you then what is the use of my life spending a whole lifetime paying attention to every little thing that's happening here I'm saying if you can drive blind on the London streets and not hit anything a good driver will feel insulted isn't it that's all I'm saying but how do we learned the use manual for ourselves though so you know is it it's not something we go and read in a book you say the problem is this all your sense organs are Outward Bound because they are survival instruments your sense organs your ability to see hear smell taste and touch are essentially your survival instruments life cannot be enhanced by them you can only Survive by better if you see better than me you can survive better than me if you hear better than me you can survive better than me but this life will not feel enhanced by perceiving more through the five sense organs and they're all Outward Bound you can see me can you roll your eyeballs Inward and scan yourself no you can hear that so much happening in the body can you hear that no so all your sense organs are only to perceive what's happening around around you not to perceive what's within you so to perceive within you you need to turn inward that needs a little because it's not survival something has to be done you know how to write English language yeah yes to learn that damn 26 alphabets you took some effort isn't it hello yeah it did it took some effort and it took some guidance because anything that's beyond survival needs striving that striving is missing in the societ there was a time there was a time where in the civilization that we refer refer to as Hindustan or Barat or today being the political country is being called as India in this culture 70% of the people were invested in inward well-being because of that they became super enhanced because of that enhancement they became so wealthy in everything rich in mathematics rich in astronomy rich in business rich in in trade rich in Industry it was the richest nation on the planet just 300 years ago see everybody from here whether it's English or French or Portuguese everybody went to India you think in search of poverty in search of wealth isn't it MH it became like that effortlessly without conquering anybody without having large armies because people invested in enhancing themselves and I'm telling you if you try to enhance your activity without enhancing yourself you'll only die of stress this is what is happening to unfortunately whole lot of CEOs I'm concerned about this because a CEO means you gave something that is important that needs to happen in the world into his hands his or her hands and if they are stressed out what misery will they create for the rest of the world it's very important that journey to taking care of ourselves like I had to learn how to read a book or to learn language no I'm saying anything that's not survival yeah will not come naturally you have to strive this Society has to create that longing being peaceful and joyful is more important for a human being's experience of life than me being better than you that TR that orientation the society has to create isn't it I agree I agree it just [Music] seems Seems like there's such a powerful narrative coming from social media magazines TV movies that are yes yes I'm not denying that making us individualistic and it's not even individualistic it's always about me being better than you it started from the kindergarten school there itself they told you I am first rank you are third rank from there it started I am better than you so the whole life is about being better than somebody means essentially what it means is I enjoy your failures does it sound like joy to you or sickness to you sounds like a sickness it is a sickness we're building it to our children right from day one what about trauma I was thinking about early trauma and how that drives us to be drives us away from a life of contentment drives us towards you know a life where we might end up in prison or we might be dysfunctional in other ways because of something early that happened when we were seven years old you know could be a small thing or a big trauma that has orientated us to be greedy or to be selfish or to be in the worst case maybe to hurt others see essentially you're finding an excuse for the way you are which you yourself don't like see if something unpleasant happened to you you have two choices either you can become wise or you can become wounded choose more unpleasant things happen to happen to you than anybody else you must be the wisest man soonest no you choose to be wounded because you carry this wound like a badge and so that you can cause the same wound to others what's the point when you know the pain of it how do you do the same thing to me but it becomes a survival technique to there is no excuse the thing is just this instead of intelligently consciously responding to life you are reacting like any other creature that's all so something bad happens to me when I'm seven years old and these neurons fire in my brain that make me react bad this is all WhatsApp uh neurology whoever told you these things right now we have a research center in Harvard Medical School in Beth Israel Hospital okay right now in October this month on 17th to 21st we have a International Conference there in these five six years of its existence they have done a lot of study one thing they found was I can't go into all the scientific things I'm not a scientist but one important thing is this simple 21 minute practice I'm talking about people who did this for over 6 to 8 weeks the endoc canonizes in their system is 70% higher than what is considered to be normal what is normal for a happy person it's 70% higher than that you know what's endoc canaban no you know what's cannabis yeah yes every human being has cannabis receptors this doesn't mean that this body was created to smoke cannabis you are supposed to produce it when you don't produce it you try to substitute from outside that's a different matter let me not go into that aspect but 70% higher what this means is it is about 23% higher than what happens in sexual orgasm or extreme exercise simply sitting here so if you felt like that every moment of your life do I have to tell you don't Rob don't kill don't do this no no that's all you need to we've not fixed that one thing see when you were a child when you were 5 years of age you were just bubbling with Joy by your own nature isn't it somebody had to work hard to make you unhappy at that time but now somebody has to work hard to make you happy what happened to the equation if you had really grown up five years if you're that happy by the time you're 31 you should have been ecstatic isn't it people typically do feel more miserable as they age they feel more stressed and more stubborn and more bitter no they're carrying more baggage that's all as you'll know this podcast is sponsored by H and one of my favorite products that they've ever created is their hu Daily Greens it actually performed so well

intelligent species on Earth aren't we you have a doubt about that for now art artificial intelligence I wanted to ask you about this no artificial intelligence we'll come to that first establish this artificial intelligence is created by human beings isn't it yes then how did it become more intelligent than me uh read more books no see everything everything that's man-made here in this world came out of human intelligence and it's still not a full expression of our intelligence still there are many many more things we can do you are thinking mind means intelligence means just intellectual process because of that you think the phone is smarter than you because it has better memory and it has better Computing Computing process so all those who are on one dimensional intelligence which is intellect which is a European problem if you ask me you you were exited but still you European you know m in culture I know you brexit it but so it's in Europe that suddenly human thought became very Eliz why it became like this is the dogmatic religious beliefs which did not allow people to think for themselves if you thought anything other than what's written in the book you're dead they made this for a few centuries so suddenly when they broke away from that and started thinking for themselves they suddenly thought this is Liberation and they eiz human thought and we crafted the whole education system on the planet based on that today you're just using one dimension of your intelligence which is intellect thought process is thought to be everything where one of them went to the extent of saying I think so I exist what are the other dimensions of human intellect will come will come I'm asking you do you exist because you think or because you exist you think because I exist I think yeah you may think if you want or you may not think it's up to you so because you exist Your Existence is important Your Existence is it because you're seeing me that you exist even if you close your eyes you still exist isn't it yeah if you don't hear anything you still exist so your existence is fundamental these are all activities of seeing hearing smelling thinking emoting these are all activities of your existence the life that you are but we got it all upside down and how how do you expect it to work because another aspect is if I ask you a simple question would you want your intellect to be sharp or blunt what's your answer sharp sharp if I give you a sharp instrument let's say we give you a very sharp knife now you must be very conscious have you move your hand if you're little la la laa kind la la la la la if you do interes will come out yes or no yes we don't give a knife to a child's hand only because of this because his hand is not steady not because knife is dangerous never in the history has it ever happened a knife jumped up and stabbed somebody it never happened believe me I've been following the news it is only the hand that whals it it can cut a vegetable and make your meal or it can do surgery and save somebody's life or stab somebody and take their life all these things the hand can do not the knife so right now your intellect is a shop instrument once you have a shop instrument you must know how to hold it this is simply not there everybody's cutting themselves up and they think something is wrong with life you can call the stress anxiety misery whatever you want essentially you have a Shar instrument and you're unconscious so you're cutting yourself up well that instrument that sharp instrument in a world where we're building machines that have the intelligence of a million people and those machines can make decisions so theoretically the machine can now decide to send a missile at a country on its own because of but if we had the intelligence we wouldn't make a Melle yeah but we we have and this is what I'm concerned about is I've sat here with all these AI experts and they're talking about the issue they're telling me they're not going to be able to contain this artificial intelligence uh see let me tell you an example I've spoken about this before I don't know if I should repeat that but let me say this to you I remember this very clearly it was 1972 you didn't exist and for the first time they installed a Gantry in the port in Mumbai called the mazagon docks in the docks they put up a Gantry till then as it was done everywhere in the world maybe a little further back there were labor who were going up into the ships and getting the sacks out and unloading those days the largest vessels were about 125 125,000 to 150,000 tons they would take 24 to 28 days to unload one vessel so they installed a Gantry so all of them went on strike a big strike which paralyzed Mumbai City at that time it was Bombay it got completely paralyzed because all the labor went on strike I'm sure many such labor strikes have happened here every time a new machine was installed people went on strike because their argument was if you put this machine this is going to unload a ship in one day what are we supposed to do with our muscle we got this muscle now what are we supposed to do they went on strike this is what now the professors academics all the intellectual people who only invested in their intellect or now saying what are we supposed to do the machine will do everything it's fantastic isn't it all the machines are doing all the hard work for you but but when the machines can think the machines could make a decision that they want to do things that AR only machines think do only machines think only machines think only if you have reduced yourself to become a mechanical thing you're only thinking about life otherwise there's a way of opening yourself up to life and experience the magic of life right now you're trapped in the logic of life when I say the logic of Life logic is the foundation it's very very important but suppose in this building we make you in the foundations today it's called basement but it's actually a dungeon we used to lock up people there or animals or something if you want somebody to have a horrible life you put them in the foundations that's all I'm saying if you live with the foundations of your life which is your logic you will live a bad life no matter where you are even if I put you up in a palace you still suffer are you scared at all are you concerned at all humans have made nuclear bombs now they've made made this thing called artificial intelligence which is accelerating are you concerned at all that it'll get into the wrong hands and people who are artificial intelligence means at least the human error will be taken out I'm happy about that the human error yeah there are so many idiots who can do anything halfrain people get to the top of the nation they could do anything at least artificial intelligence means there'll be a proper process before we launch anything so you're happy about artificial intelligence I'm happy about any Dev velopment because essentially how I see is let me tell you my experience first experience of an intelligent machine I was probably 12 13 years old I was uh in my ninth standard and I went to school only when I had to most of the time I got lost on the way but when I went I thought this was just an unnecessary nonsense in my life so I spent most of the time in the library and barely went to the classroom like me so one day somebody brought a flatbed calculator maybe you not even seen one like that you all doing on the phone and iPad flatbed calculator is most of it is flat one little screen like this we've never seen anything like this so you say you know 185 into 365 took answer is right there I looked at it and I felt really insulted why the hell are they tormenting me in a mathematics class when this machine is there why can't they make one machine for chemistry one machine for physics one machine for every damn thing I enjoyed swimming in The Lakes I enjoyed sitting on the trees I enjoyed loitering around all over the countryside I learned my life like that but this nonsense why am I going through this when this silly machine can do this at last my dream is coming true I'm very happy everything that human beings can do see this silly mentality what will happen to our jobs why do you need a job all you need is food to survive suppose everybody on the planet is fed I know those guys idiots will become drunkards and drug addicts that's a different matter but if everybody's fed and you don't have to worry about your living this is when human beings can do something absolutely fantastic right now they're spending their life just to earn a living when will they make a life out of themselves what you said sounds almost identical to what the founder and the CEO of open AI who made chat GPT which is leading the leading the way at the moment said literally yesterday uh in a interview he did he said if we can get people to a point where they don't have to worry about tedious jobs then they can live these Blissful lives we'll do one thing we'll remove all the Earth moving machines and everything give everybody a pickaxe and a crow bar and a spade let them all go back to the mines and construction everywhere let them start doing physically will they protest or no they will protest Ah that's what will happen in 50 years time if you ask them to multiply they'll protest that's what I said the moment first moment I saw the calculator I said what this is this nonsense why am I doing all this when I can do Tok to to here the the counterargument to that is that people need a sense of like purpose something to you need a false purpose to live because you have not even made an attempt to understand what this life is about what its potential is about you need a false purpose you go and dig in the mind and it's your purpose and then you produce children two children putting bread on the table is a big purpose to your life silliest way to live for a human being that's how most people live unfortunately that's the kind of world we have created and the world that if you could wave a one now and create a different World which I know you're trying to do in fact you're Bu you're building a a city in America right you're part of a project this is why I find it so fascinating because I look at the way we've designed society and we're so it's so stubborn in the way we've designed it I often wonder if we're going to have to go back to a blank canvas and redesign it again from the ground up that's never going to happen where is a blank canvas how do you create a blank canvas that's never going to happen the desert somewhere you have to slowly see the thing is this happened can I tell you a joke please one day a cardiologist a famous cardiologist a doctor went because he was driving an Aston Martin and it gives trouble you know he went to the garage and the mechanic said uh yes doctor leave the car here evening I'll have it ready the doctor took took the taxi and went to the hospital and came back in the evening the mechanic had not even touched it then I said hey why is it not already oh no doc this is this that tomorrow morning I'll have it ready for tomorrow morning he came car was not ready said hey what are you trying to do why is it that you're not doing then mechanic said huh see I fix your engine you pay me 500 but you fix somebody's heart and they pay you 50,000 why is that you fixing an engine I'm fixing an engine doctor said try to fix it when it's running if you could demolish everything and rebuild it's very easy the thing is you have to rebuild it when it's on that is the whole challenge isn't it that goes for individual human being that goes for the society that goes for the world we we have to rebuild it when it's still functioning after you demolish means are you inviting a nuclear Holocaust so that later on we can rebuild it it's not a good idea no that's not what we want and that's why the practice that you described yes matters because it doesn't matter even if you're Manning a nuclear bomb let's say it's your job to press the button you waiting there if you are miserable frustrated depressed even without a you may press if it was in your hand sometimes it may happen but if you're joyful Blissful naturally you look at see this is something people don't understand people think love brings them happiness it's not true if you're very joyful you will look at look upon everything in a loving manner because what you call is Joy love let me put it this way if your body becomes pleasant we call this health you want it yes if it becomes very pleasant we call it pleasure you want it yes if your mind becomes pleasant we call this peace you want only to create pleasantness in your surroundings do you need the cooperation of various people and many forces around you but to create pleasantness in your body mind emotion and energy is 100% your business if you were the only person on this planet would you know whether you're good or bad I wouldn't know so it is only by comparison that you know that you're good but if you are the only person on this planet if you were joyful would you know you're joyful yes that's important so you're saying focus on Joy and how we feel versus good or bad no I don't I'm not saying focus on Joy I'm just saying you understand this your interiority can happen 100% your way if you are willing external things will not happen 100% our way we have to strive some things happen our way many things don't happen our way but internally if you're happening your way you will keep yourself very pleasant when you're pleasant we can expect Pleasant things from you when you're unpleasant I expect Pleasant things from you where is it going to happen people in the name of religion in the Name of Love in the name of caring they've done Terrible Things isn't it most horrendous things have been done a question I've often asked myself is am I you talked about like fake purpose a second ago how do how do I know if the because when you interview people and you say like what's your purpose or what's your mission they'll sit here and they'll give me lots of things right some of them might be I want to help I'm just fooling around I have no Mission no no not you I'm saying you ask a kid on the the street what's your mission younger kids these days will say they they want to save the world or they want to they want to be a public speaker or they want to be a YouTuber H do you view those as fake Ambitions in that from confused people see I did not say fake Ambitions the thing is you're making up a purpose to bring some meaning to your life yeah what you need to understand is life is a phenomena beyond all meanings meanings is an ailment of your mind only human mind needs meanings sun comes up in the morning doesn't need a meaning full moon out there doesn't need a meaning tired doesn't need a meaning only place where you need a meaning is your head your mind needs a meaning why have you seen this you've been at some point at least for moments you've been very joyful blissed out you've been at that time do you ask what is is the meaning of life no no only when you're miserable it's important so you create one problem and then you create another problem and another problem and you think it's a solution no meaning is a serious problem meaning has become meaningful for somebody only because they're in some way distressed the the process of life and the experience of life has become burdensome why am I carrying this I want a meaning for the burden that I'm bearing if life was a blissful process why would you care what is the meaning so when people people must ask you all the time what's the meaning of life and you must then does that suggest that they are absent of bliss see this meaning problem is a very Western problem in the Eastern world we don't ask for meaning we are always looking for profoundness of Life what's the difference the difference is digging deeper into yourself and creating something around your head are two different things meaning is so meaning is looking outside for a reason outside or inside doesn't matter but you're trying to build a psychological solution to an existential reality and you have to accept that ex existential reality the existential reality is you don't know where the hell you came from and I don't know where I'm going and you don't know where you're going you just here for a brief amount of time and you think you are the center of the world that means you must be very religious because it's the religious people who went on propagating that this planet is the center of the universe though in India for over 6,000 years people have known planet is round and it goes around the Sun clearly there are drawings and there are books there are documents which clearly say that but people who are following dogmatic religious processes they they propagated that this is the center of the universe now will they say we said what is wrong and apologize for that no because when I think I am the center of the universe I will be doing so many idiotic things you must apologize if you are the one who taught me that nonsense so life doesn't have a birth let me tell you given mean this happened there was a Bishop in his tumul at that time it was Constantinople you know I'm I mean I'm not trying to insult any Community but this actually happened so I'm quoting the thing in 1924 this bishop was part of the Greek Orthodox Church very Orthodox church and he's a bishop so all his life he's a man of cloth he was there but being in his tumble you know all these exotic stories come wafting AC across the Bosphorus from India about the mystics about the yogis about many many things India is full of stories like this and for ages these things have been coming and excited people to travel to the east all this stuff so he always wanted to go to India and meet a real Yogi or a Mystic but being a man of cloth he couldn't decide where he goes and doesn't go when he was over 60 years of age he got an opportunity to go to India he went to Southern India and found a good guide who could guide him and the guide took him and said see on this particular Mountain if you go this way this way this way he gave all the landmarks if you go there there's a cave there there is a yogi that is a man you're looking for so our Bishop went all the way up mountains are not kind to people who lived in churches or in indoors you know they don't care who you are uh they trouble you so with great difficulty he went up when he went to that place just outside the cave a yogi was sitting totally blissed out with his eyes closed so you the bishop had heard that if you see a yogi you must prostrate before him so he went down and he was not fit for those kind of postures but with great difficulty he went down huffing puffing he stood up again hearing all the commotion the yogi opened his eyes and smiled then the bishop asked can I ask you a question this is the first introduction the yogi laughed and said well by all means you can ask a question then the bishop asked what is life see as a human being you have the intelligence to ask this question when you were 8 years of age well in your childishness you missed it at least when you were 16 you should have asked definitely you have the intelligence to ask that question but now you're well over 60 now you're asking what is life but it's okay it's better late than never you know so when he said that Yogi went into raptures life life is like the fragrance of jasman you know upon the gentle Prince spring Breeze the bishop said what fragrance of Jasmine upon gentle spring Breeze my teacher told me life is like a thorn once it gets into you if you sit it hurts if you stand it hurts if you lie down it hurts and you are saying it is like the fragrance of Jasmine upon gentle spring Breeze then the yogi laughed and said well that's his life you must understand your experience of life is determined by you it's your choice the last thing I wanted to ask you about about is a campaign you've recently um been putting a lot of effort into which is the save soil campaign I want to know why you're doing that and why that message in campaign is so important for all of us one important element of why human beings will become mentally ill in the next 15 to 20 years lot of people are estimating there may not be a single family left without one mentally ill person at least that's what they're saying so this mental illness why see one thing is in the last 100 years of industrial level of Agriculture one thing that's happened is we are only seeing soil as a resource soil is not a resource it's your Source it is the source of your life it is the largest living substance or system on the planet if you take a handful of soil it has 8 to 10 billion organisms in it it is the most intense tense life and the largest living system not just on the planet in the known universe it is the largest living system but still over 80% of the nations are treating soil as a resource which they think they can fix it by adding a chemical or take away chemical let me come to this very quickly what is the problem see if today all the insects disappear from this planet in another two and a half to four years all life on this planet including you and me and plant life everything will be gone insects go away if all the worms go away today in the next one and a half to two years or two and a half years all life on this planet will be extinct if all the microbes go away we both of us disappear within the next few seconds this is the reality they are the foundational life we are the cherry on the cake right now average loss of microbial life is like this 20 7,000 species of organisms are going extinct per year 27,000 species are going extinct per year at this rate it's estimated in the next 25 to 40 years we will come to a place where it'll be very difficult for human beings to find basic nourishment on the planet first thing that will collapse is your software that's what you're seeing in terms of psychological ailments that's not the only reason all those things are there but the most important thing is lack of nourishment just to give you a perspective some studies are been done in California what they are saying is in 1920 if you ate one orange what nutrients you got from that if you want that today you need to eat eight oranges has there been a day when you ate eight oranges in a day no this goes for everything else you are eating empty food which doesn't have richness just look at the Google Map don't don't go by what I say just look at the Google map of the world how many green patches how many brown patches it is terrifying we have a closing tradition on this podcast where the last guest leaves a question for the next guest not knowing who they're going to leave the question for who was that guy can't tell you it's a secret their question to to you not knowing who it was for they didn't know it was for you is what in your heart of hearts matters to you I have only one heart that also I gave away long time ago heart of hearts I don't have all those things I broke my heart into a million pieces and threw it away in the world I live not because of my values I live not because of my morality I live not because of some Commandments from somewhere I live live out of my Humanity thank [Music] you",
