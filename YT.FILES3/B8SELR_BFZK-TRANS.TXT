  "transcript": "so it occurred to me that it might actually be beneficial to talk about kind of where I'm at in terms of uh safety so this uh this slide deck or this presentation kind of comes uh after several conversations that I've had with various people you might have seen that I've uh been on several podcasts I've got a few more that I'm uh appearing on as a guest and as always by having conversations with other people and thinkers in this space um that has helped me crystallize kind of my position and really like the question is okay safety versus acceleration open source versus closed source and really I mean the tldr is optimized for research I don't really I'm not going to say I don't care like it's not that Blas but like the primary thing that I want to optimize for on a numerical level is optimizing for research so let's let's dig into this and I'll tell you exactly what I mean so you know we could talk about open source versus close Source there's lots and lots of arguments on either side as to um safety control uh you know for instance with closed Source AI you can hold the companies responsible if they do harm you shut the company down you uh you sanction them or whatever open source once it's out in the wild there's not much you can do but researchers can get a hold of it and so having worked with uh researchers in the academic space open source AI is actually really critical for all research um and another thing to keep in mind is a lot of the benefits that closed Source AI has actually came from open source research it comes from MIT and Stanford um and so on and so forth and there is a huge interplay between closed source and open source so you basically have to have both you can't have either or and even if you wanted to so this was this was kind of a thought experiment I did on a on a podcast that I was a guest on even if you had a magic button where you can say it's all open source or all all closed Source you wouldn't want to hit that button because you actually do need both and there's a lots of strengths and weaknesses to both and and kind of the place where I'm at is I don't know which direction it should go or if it should change at all perhaps the current balance of open versus closed is the optimal or close to Optimal uh uh kind of policy or Paradigm uh ratio between open and closed source so uh as mentioned there are plenty of advantages to closed Source uh you from hold you know courts holding companies accountable to the market holding companies accountable so for for instance if you know and and a lot of people have put this in the messages or the comments section lately like if an AI company if you don't like what they're doing you cancel your subscription you vote with your dollars now obviously that doesn't shut them down but it does send a signal to them saying hey I don't like what you're doing um and then who you choose to give your money to so for instance I subscribe to perplexity and anthropic and open AI That's a signal to them saying hey I appreciate what you're doing I also have wise cut Ai and um Mid Journey so again you know I have a bunch of AI subscriptions but that is a market signal that's saying hey um me as a person my I'm I'm giving you a signal of not just value but moral alignment um by by virtue of giving you money now then of course there's regulatory oversight and Regulatory capture is a huge huge huge risk um we've been talking about quite extensively with the EU AI act the upcoming um American reg uh regulation I tried say regulation and legislation at the same time doesn't work um anyways you get the idea like that accountability and the financial incentives are there but of course when there's Financial incentives there can also be perverse incentives because then you're locked in a race Dynamic and so on and so forth so there's pros and cons to closed Source just as the same that there's pros and cons to open source and so um the primary thing oh and by the way the reason that I have this is just because this is what mid Journey thinks the typical GitHub user looks like um and there was once upon a time that this looked more like me but you know the hair anyways sorry uh so open source again open source is absolutely critical for research um you know whether it is uh researchers doing ablation tests on you know llama and that sort of stuff um that helps everyone and so this is this is why I really particularly appreciate the ethos of meta and uh less so Google today but Google really started all this with all their open Source Research into deep learning and Transformer architecture because by by making those tools available to universities to other companies um that really greatly amplifies the amount of research that can be done um because guess what a lot of University departments they don't necessarily have the funding um to spend tens of thousands of dollars on inference costs or uh Flagship models from Amazon and Microsoft now that being said uh Microsoft has their own internal research Tois ision Amazon has their own internal research Division and most of these companies also hand out gigantic grants to researchers I have people in my community and and local friends who have $10,000 of credit um U of like inference credits on Amazon um I think one actually had had a grant up to 100,000 uh like tokens or whatever like dollars worth of credit tokens I'm not sure exactly how it works but my point is is that um even there again there is a balance between open and closed source and even the big shops even the big Tech um and Big Iron ones a lot of them are still participating in open- Source uh research so you know again it's not it's not an either or it's a both you absolutely need both and so this is I guess the reason that I'm making this video is because I'm really tired of hearing this debate um like it's we need to stop oversimplifying it now one thing that I will also say is that there are huge incentives um that are required for this investment you know Amazon Microsoft a bunch of others they're talking about investing up to a hundred billion dollar in AI um infrastructure and research like that is incredible and you know yes that is accelerationist because you know as I always say and I continuously say where money goes results follow and so you know you think that project Stargate you know Microsoft with a hundred billion dollar uh AI data center in the desert that's going to yield results Amazon Elon Musk all of these guys that are that are that are dumping money into this all the investors um that are flocking to it and all the all the tangential all the downstream um things like building more chip Fabs building more power infrastructure uh building more data infrastructure all of these things are going to have huge KnockOn effects um I think Elon Musk was just cited as saying like people should get into lithium um not Financial advice not investing advice I don't even know if he said it but uh you know it was attributed to him so he's like guys we need more of these resources and so this is again why you absolutely need closed Source you need to protect intellectual property rights in order to incentivize investment of this level that is on the acceleration side now what's on the safety side so the safety side I'll get to in just a second but but again what I want to point out is even with you know billions and billions of dollars on the line a lot of these people are still contributing to open source Elon Musk open sourced grock it's not grock one it's not an impressive model but that is now another tool in the toolbox that all researchers around the entire world can use and so really my policy is whatever we do uh whether it is academic or business or economic or political or whatever we should optimize for a total amount of research being done and the reason that I say this is because the way that I see it is in order to get what everyone wants cuz we want we want safe we you know we we all want to be safe we don't want to um you know nuke or El out of existence we don't want nuclear war we don't want you know AI machine Uprising you know so on and so forth but we also want the benefits right we want the carrot we want that shining beacon on the hill of the utopian future that is powered by artificial intelligence and so on and so forth we want both and so if you optimize for research research is what underpins both of those so another way to think of it is you know it requires a certain amount of uh research points to get to the safe ending it also requires a certain amount of uh research points to get to the utopian ending so what we need what those have in common is more research and so whatever policy is um whether you know you're a mid-level manager or an executive at a big tech company or a a research Department um you know at you know Stanford or Clemson or wherever whatever decisions we make we should be optimizing for research and I kind of think we already are so again this is why this is this I haven't really made any videos or talking about this CU personally I feel like it's a total nonissue there's plent plenty of Open Source research there's plenty of closed Source research there's plenty of funding the research is happening and lots of people are doing the Safety Research I don't think we really need to manipulate the system anymore and in fact uh you know stacking the deck or manipulating the system could have adverse effects um could incentivize uh things that we don't want to see from here so one analogy that I like to use is you Grand strategy games so you Starcraft is not necessarily Grand strategy but you know like Rome Total War Stellaris and those other things where you get to build research bases so one one way that I like to play Grand strategy games is you build as much research as you can and the reason is because then that gets you to accelerate down your Tech Tree faster and so then if you're the most advanced player on the board you win by default and so that's kind of my uh my my thing and of course in the grand strategy game on planet Earth it's basically like America versus China and guess what that's what both of these nations are doing but at the same time I think that if we come to a common understanding and a shared understanding of how to navigate um all the uh economic incentives all the technological incentives the nature of AI the nature of what we're building if we all get to a high enough research level you know get to we're at let's say we're at tier three right now and we need to get to tier six in order to get the utopian safe you know post scarcity uh post Labor uh ending well it behooves all of us to work together to get there and so again optimize for research that's my primary policy whatever else gets there because more more research is better and so the way that I the way that I'm starting to characterize this is it's a win-win we can get there safe and we can get there fast it's not an either or and um what what what some people help me understand is that for those that pitch it as an either or it is either safe or it is acceleration it is either safe or fast or you know open or closed it's it's not it was that that is a false choice that is a false dichotomy that was never really the true option yes if you look at Twitter if you look at Reddit it is but like that's just not the way the world works that's not the way that the governments work that's not the way that corporations work that's not the way that universities work it is always a little bit of both and so really like we're looking for the win-win and the win-win here is just more research optimize for research um you know the number of man hours per year um looking at Ai and that's a big reason why I do what I do I've had dozens if not hundreds of people message me over the last few months over the last couple years um saying hey like you inspired me to get into AI research whether it's deployment safety alignment whatever and so yeah like let's optimize for that because again the more research is being done the more economic growth we have the faster we solve you know problems like you disease aging the sooner we solve climate change more research is better more research is better just keep optimizing for research so thanks for watching I hope you got a lot out of this nice short uh video for the day um cheers have a good one",
