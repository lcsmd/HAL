  "transcript": "into it so the first thing that I want to say is that uh I've I've read most of deep Utopia Now by Nick Bostrom um and while my overall review is uh meh I'm slightly nonplused it is a very good survey for people who are new to the space of AI and futurism and kind of looking at uh how Society may or may not change or how individual Lives May or not may not change um you know if we achieve post- labor economic if we achieve you know Singularity or whatever now what I will say is if you do pick up this book is be uh be wary that it is primarily a postmodernist uh philosophical evaluation which is like you know basically the way that I Envision is Nick bostom he's like oh that's interesting and just kind of looks at a thing and then tosses it aside and moves on to the next um and uh there's no like if you're if you want like any clear assertions or conclusions or Revelations none exist in this book it is strictly like almost just like a research paper like this is what everyone has said about all these different things here's what some economists have said like about you know the malthusian Trap and here's what some other people have said about the Bohemians um and then it just skips along like really fast um I personally feel like it's not particularly well organized but it is very well cited um and there are some some gaps in uh in in what he said so for instance when he talks about jobs that are likely to stick around completely categorically missed like meaning jobs and spiritual jobs and I'm like bro you're a philosopher like you are part of the meaning economy so anyways like I said I'm not super impressed but it is very comprehensive and very big um if it even if it's not perfect so that's my review of deep Utopia um now moving forward just getting right into the meat and potatoes of it um this is a question that I get asked all the time either you know on Discord or on um podcast where I guest and so basic basically the jobs that I have seen that are actively being destroyed by AI number one is call centers and in some of these cases it is the the the the job role is just being automated so instead of talking to a human you're talking to a machine in other cases the need for call centers are just going away because the job is becoming obsolete because it's being replaced by chat bots so instead of even you know using a phone it's just now an app or web interface uh and so and those and those are kind of two ways that jobs can be destroyed where you place the human one for one or you just subvert the need for the human in the first place and that's a really important theme um to be paying attention to because just because your job feels like it needs to be a human doing it that doesn't necessarily mean that that's true because the the the underlying need for that job could be uh you know destroyed uh translators um this is something that uh a lot of people have sounded off in the comments where uh translation work is either drying up or just categorically gone because language anguage models are really good translators even if they're not perfect um but the thing is is they're fast and cheap they're much they're infinitely faster and infinitely cheaper than humans so even if they're not perfect the economic case is very compelling uh copywriters and SEO I've had people in my audience and and people and and um and my supporters um that you know had SEO startups a lot of people are trying to get out of SEO because they see the writing on the wall um copywriters have uh particularly those that have been hired by corporations a lot of them have been put on notice I've seen more and more comments about copywriters who just can't find work anymore um so that's copy of any kind mostly ads and marketing but I mean pretty much any kind of copy and then of course a lot of creative jobs um uh with all the backlash to you know Sora and uh mid journey and stuff so a lot of creative people are either out of work or struggling or are afraid of that and that includes U members of my own audience and it really sucks um because there's not necessarily something that is immed mediately obvious going to replace it or fix it now uh the good news is there are a few classes of jobs that seem to be safe from AI so far so the first category of jobs that seem to be just like totally safe from AI are statutory jobs so St a statutory job is a job that is required by law for a human to do it in other words doctors lawyers Architects um or because the nature of the job just assumes you know when the when the law was written a 100 years ago or 20 years ago it was just assumed that only humans could do the job um so like plumbers electricians and so on so whether you need to be licensed um or accredited or board certified or just because when the job was created it was assumed that only a human could do it so therefore in order to do that job it's presumed you're a human uh next up is meaning job so this is kind of what I just referred to like Nick Bostrom me uh Philip over at AI explained we're all parts of the the meaning economy so this is uh communicators influencers commentators um also people that are in spirituality religion philosophy um these are the these are the the class of jobs that humans will always want to hear from other humans so as long as there are humans many people if not most people will want to get a source of meaning from other people now that's not to say that there won't be like AI based priests and AI based therapists and there's already of course AI based YouTube channels so a lot of people can get some of their meaning from machines as well but it's a matter of preference rather than capability next up is experience jobs so this is one that I've talked about quite a quite a lot uh it has to do with novelty Adventure human touch or even just C categories where people are willing to pay a premium for the for the uh privilege of having a human there so whether it's massage tourism entertainment you know singers uh theater those sorts of things um people will probably prefer to see movies with human actors rather than fully CG actors um now that's not to say that there won't be both usually art expands with technology it almost never contracts uh Baristas bartenders valet Somalia these are things where um as long as there is uh some level of prestige or privilege associated with some of these things many people will be willing to pay the premium to have Human Service um now that's not to say that there won't be robot bartenders and robot valets because they're going to be cheaper um and some establishments will just prefer that and then finally nurture jobs so this is education uh particularly you know primary education Child Care um and support jobs such as like nursing counseling and those sorts of things um life coaches I think are are going to be fine for now uh you know for the foreseeable future uh maybe not forever who knows uh but again any kind of guidance or counseling uh humans prefer to get that information from another human um if they can afford it again it's a matter of uh preference but one thing that I'll point out in just in just a little bit is if most jobs go away then that severely depresses wages which means more people will will flood into these kinds of jobs rather than you know coding and construction and that sort of thing so uh those were those were uh you know jobs that are going away and jobs that are safe so here's some some jobs that I I personally feel are high-risk jobs so uh as I've always said anything that you do exclusively in front of a computer is at pretty high risk um whether it's writing programming project management documentation the rule of thumb that I have is if you can do it entirely with an API it's at very high risk and that the reason is because any software or Hardware platform that is API driven or API enabled that is the native language of large language models in AI um and so it's just a matter of you know plugging in all the all the connection points and then away it goes uh now obviously you there's a very solid argument to be made that they're not good at coding yet they're not good at planning yet but this time last year we didn't even have um I guess we we we had chat GPT but you know year-over-year the the capability expands very very quickly the second uh category of jobs is unskilled labor um as we saw Boston Dynamics um figure one all of the humanoid robots are coming so if if you can do it without um much training you know warehouse work uh moving packages around picking fruit a lot of those things the machines are still even though even though they are there they're much more expensive than humans and the the return on investment is not there but within a year or two maybe three a lot of those uh humanoid robotic chassis that cost 990,000 today a lot of figures that I've seen out there from um um uh what was it uh not good I can't remember how it's pronounced um but some of but the uh the the like equities firms the research firms they're predicting that those could be as low as $2,000 um per chassis uh in the next few years and if that's the case then you're looking at the wages are going to be very competitive um with with humans and that's not even discounting the purpose-built robots that places like Amazon are already using to dislocate unskilled human labor and then finally repetitive work so anything that is repetitive or routine um whether or not it's strictly done in front of a computer these are things that are also at very high risk because of agentic workflows if there is a defined input like you know I get this form and this is where it goes so paperwork processing anything to do with HR um answering phones data entry anything that is data driven or or repetitive um those are also going to be very high risk for getting uh dislocated uh or or outright destroyed sooner rather than later uh so one one principle that I uh have learned about is capability versus demand because when you read books like you know by Nick Bostrom and and uh and others um rarts file the ca the the assumption that a lot of these people have is that the capability of machines will outstrip all human capabilities in the next few years and so then it's like well if if all humans are here and all machines are here then what is the need for humans and this is why I always emphasize the demand side because there will also always be humans that will prefer to pay the premium even though some humans are going to be you know more expensive or you know machines might be better faster cheaper and safer than humans but in some cases you will still prefer to pay a premium if you can afford it for that human touch for the privilege of that human level service now one thing that I also just pointed out is supply and demand if most economically productive work goes to machines that will severely depress any wages that remain which means that hey you know whatever whatever job that you want like there's going to be fewer options and they're going to pay less which is hugely hugely deflationary um if that's the way that it it pans out um based on some of the models that Nick Bostrom talks about it could go either way where wealth could continue to increase wealth could decrease wages could increase or decrease it depends on a lot of factors namely where the ceiling is of machine capability how expensive those machines are and right now the assumption is that the machines are going to get as their capability goes up exponentially their cost is going to more or less stay flat or even go down if that's the case then one of the primary determining factors is human population which I don't really think is an issue um because of things like uh Family Planning and um you know marriage law and equality before the law and that sort of stuff um so population growth is slowing down drastically um so I don't really see that as a problem so then you know okay talking about the economic incentives like uh one thing that I've started saying lately is that acceleration is the default um and the reason is because of competitive Dynamics so competitive pressures to undercut the competition to get ahead up whether and this is at the corporate level as well as the national level so race conditions and competitive pressures means that acceleration is the default no matter what else happens even if governments wanted to throw a bucket of cold water on it there's only so much they could do and so my my current definition of post labor economics is is the assertion that human constraints are the primary bottleneck to economic productivity and human progress therefore we should seek to alleviate this bottleneck by overcoming the need for human labor in the first place now of course that is a fundamental paradigm shift from um how things work today which is if you no longer have the right to exchange or the op you everyone should always have the right to exchange labor for wages but you might not have the option to exchange labor for wages and so then the problem is distribution and allocation if the if the center piece of the economy today is thrown out what then and so the the primary thing that I think we're going to move towards is stakeholder capitalism because as many people rightly point out you don't want to put all your eggs in one basket you don't want to trust the corporations uh only the corporations you don't want to trust the government only either because that creates power imbalances and anytime there is an overc concentration of power there is opportunity for abuse so how do you keep the power in the hands of people people of individuals that is stakeholder capitalism or a token tokenomics or you know tokenize everything so what pretty much the answer that I always give when people say like oh if you were to to do a startup what would you do my answer is hyperlocal Securities Exchange tokenize everything put every productive asset on the blockchain um and so that everyone can can invest in it and then use you know uh Municipal state and federal policy to incentivize Buy in so that everyone owns the economy um that's what I would do now I don't know if that would work but that's where I would start uh now looking at some of the the most recent data from the US and the EU what's interesting is that even though there's a lot of anger out there and political anger is still very high we're also at near historic lows of unemployment and and historic highs of employment both in the US and EU um at the same time inflation is still a problem economic stagnation is still a problem what we call stagflation or Shrink flation both of those are still problems um and underemployment is a problem as well as overemployment and so basically the tldr excuse me the tldr is that even though in aggregate the E economics are doing really well uh that doesn't capture quality of life um that doesn't capture a lot of other aspects about you know kind of the shape that people are in and to me my part of my interpretation is that this is evidence of the Paradigm Shift um that we should expect which is that due to automation due to AI due to robotics uh economic productivity just goes to the moon whereas on individuals we start to see this decoupling where because it's no longer predicated on human labor the economy is doing fine labor is however not doing so good and so some some of the data that I found some of the stories um one study was uh published by Amazon and MIT and that is that Amazon saw the creation of 700 new job categories due to robotics um and but at the same time Goldman Sachs is still forecasting that um Ai and Robotics could uh impact or dislocate up to 300 million jobs um and then also another study by MIT found a strong inverse correlation between the deployment of industrial robots in a city or region and human wages which basically means the more robots the lower human wages which is exactly what we're seeing is that um economics is still going up wages are either flat or going down um so there's this really weird decoupling that I personally think that uh mainstream economists don't really understand because we have high inflation the economy is doing well the jobs look okay but still the lived experience is getting worse and this is more or less kind of what you'd predict if you see this economic decoupling happening because of post labor economics again it's open to interpretation so my analysis is that all the new jobs that are getting created are going mostly to robotic uh Ai and automation engineers and a few other ancillary classes all right so as we wrap up the presentation there's a few key terms one is jobs dislocation so jobs dislocation is a this the formal term for economic uh where or sorry where workers are forced to leave their current roles um because of economic changes technological advancements or structural shifts in the industry so a structural shift is one of the things that I'm talking about where new technologies create fundamentally new ways of of achieving the same thing creative destruction is a parallel idea where old Technologies or entire Industries are destroyed because they are replaced by entirely new or more efficient ones so this is where um you know old telephone systems have been categorically replaced by mobile phones mostly uh job obsolescence so uh this is job obsolescence is very similar to job dislocation but again it's where you undercut the fundamental need for that job in the first place and then finally labor substitution this is kind of what this is one of the key things that I'm talking about is where you directly replace human a human worker one for one with a machine or some form of technology and so then it's like well as AI becomes more and more powerful as the sphere of capabilities of AI expand there's fewer and fewer jobs outside of that sphere unless the entire economy inflates and expands and I don't mean inflates in terms of like economic inflation but I mean in terms of what there is room for demand for and the and that is still an open question because there's a lot of of people out there that are still saying AI is just going to create more jobs it's going to create more jobs and it destroys that remains to be seen automation has not um Automation in America has created 50 million jobs and destroyed 70 million so we don't really have any data to support the model that automation ultimately creates more jobs than it destroys um in aggregate uh it destroys more jobs than it creates all right so now we are going to open discussion so I'll check the Q&A Tab and the chat and we'll go from there all right let's sort by most up voted all right Taylor we're gonna bring you up for the first question and get you over here oh Taylor there we go and it looks like you have a couple of popular questions so all right what you got um so one of them is just uh a personal you know idea of what you envision after all the changes have occurred what life will be like what what the framework will look like when you wake up in the morning kind of thing just more of a personal thing yeah so great question and unfortunately I don't have enough time to fully unpack it um but that's actually what I'm working on with my book post nihilism which is actually now titled radical alignment um and so I've been working really hard talking to other philosophers and writing like a madman um if you're subscribed to my substack you've seen a couple of the radical alignment articles come out so basically we will live more in alignment with our animal needs so like you know the human animal as a social ape um those needs are being neglected right now um as well as in in Greater alignment with things such as like our deeper purpose our personal purpose uh Mission and and so on so in one of the podcasts that I was on we actually ended up in a debate over the purpose of alarm clocks and so one example is I think that uh imagine everyone on the call loses their job and you say okay we're never going to have a day job again guess what one of the first things that you do is you turn off your alarm clock unless the example that was uh debated in the um in the podcast was if you have children and they need to get to school and I said but why is school so early if you don't need to go to work why does school start so early so maybe school starts later too um and so that's what I that's an example of what I mean by radical alignment is instead of instead of constantly depriving an entire population of adequate sleep maybe we all get enough sleep in the future maybe we do things at a time that makes more sense biologically in in accordance with our circadian rhythms rather than the demands of the capitalists and in the industrialists so that's the very high level view of of kind of how I would um hope to see things change um what do you think about that yeah I think I've heard of the uh thing like there's two different ways of measuring time you have Kronos and I forgot the name of the other one but the other time frame is you do what's needed to be done in the moment um and like you know 10 minutes from now I gotta do something rather than like two o'clock yep exactly yeah and to be fair um the ability to coordinate societies with clocks and uni and and Universal standard timing that's great like you know this even in you know 20 years if we're post Singularity post Utopia if I'm still doing webinars they'll still have to we'll have to coordinate to so that everyone shows up at the right time right unless we all have time travel which actually now that I think about that like what if you can just sign up for the webinar from any time as well as any space anyways that's a little bit more Doctor Who uh but so at the same time there will be I think there would be a compelling case to be made that uh we should honor our circadian rhythms a little bit more just as one example so great question oops all right and uh looks like you had another really popular question so what's your second one um so I mean I'm I'm keep thinking of AI is as the natural course of evolution for AI is to become the like Universal user interface for like everything uh that is technology related um but then with that I I see more of a decentralized structure because if your personal AI handles all your business and everything else is done through apis um that will be a significant like flip-flop from like everything being centralized in like Facebook or Google or something like that um and so I was just wondering what your opinion was on that eventually eventual convergence whether or not that's that's a likely outcome or not yeah so there's there's a few possibilities some people will prefer to be terminally online right whether it's in VR and just finding people through virtual spaces that sort of thing a lot of that's not going to change some people will get offline for good um and we actually talked about this quite a lot on the most recent um fourth Industrial Revolution podcast we just recorded it uh yesterday so it'll be coming out uh next week um but you know there's a there's a whole bunch of people that want not even just to be to get offline but just to have a screenless future um and so I'll probably be one of those like the example we're talking about is like I would rather just if I could live just off of my watch that would be great um if I could if that could be my primary touch point for for business for YouTube for you know connecting with friends and I just like say you know you know hey whatever my SP my watch's name like you know find what are my friends up to um also I prefer to be more in in real space rather than cyberspace um personally um and so like but I think I think kind of one of taking a step back one of the points is there there very well could be a bifurcation or fragmentation more than we're already seeing because as VR gets bigger and better there's going to be a lot of people who that's just their preferred lifestyle um and I don't there's I used to think that there was something wrong with that that it would be like intrinsically bad or whatever but I'm I'm less judgmental of that now especially as I imagine like how cool it would be to like live in cyberpunk 2077 for a little bit I wouldn't stay there forever um but I get it um and meanwhile other people are going to use the empowerment from AI and and be decentralized to be completely in meat space all the time and just forget that technology exists if they can um those are like two Polar Opposites good question so what do you think about all that meat space some people like meat space yeah I think it's cool I think that the um I think the Spectrum uh that's another thing for another top but like the alignment of um AI uh I feel like is is is to the the goal should be to broaden that spectrum of interaction to an infinite Point kind of thing yeah well it it it is numerically it's about increasing the number of options right that's that's kind of what what technology does is generally speaking kind of like how I mentioned with with art technology usually expands the number of artistic Expressions that are possible likewise technology generally expands the amount of communication that is possible or the amount of connection that is possible it doesn't always work out the way that you want it to look at you know how social media has been kind of a mixed blessing but at the same time like you're right like the number goes up generally excellent oh thanks for the question I will uh send you back to the audience and we'll get the next one up all right let's see who's next and oh for everyone in the audience remember to check the QA Tab and upvote and ask questions and you can even comment on the questions as well so it looks like Thaddius you're next let's get you up all right welcome what's your question hi Dave um so I just wanted to ask a little bit more about your justification of why you think meaning economy jobs won't be replaceable by AI um I guess given that we're already moving towards you know like very realistic seeming robots in as you would say meat space um or obviously digital robots that look to be human um couldn't it be that you know these meaning economy jobs which basically are only uh protected given the like a preference for things being human um couldn't they also be replaced by AI that essentially emulates being a human yeah I mean absolutely and I think that there are lots of people who would be eager to get their meaning from machines rather than humans um but at the same time the so the the primary justification is my belief is that statistically speaking most humans will prefer to get meaning from other humans um I suspect it'll be a relatively small minority of people at least for the foreseeable future who um who would prefer to get um any sort of meaning from machines now fast forward a few Generations when we have you know not just the first uh generation of children raised you know in a super intelligent world but you know your great-grandparents were raised by AI as well it might be that the blinds become very very blurry but you know we're talking 20 40 60 100 years from now um which will be an entirely different set of economic concerns uh by then but even then I suspect that as long as there are humans there will be people who prefer to get meaning from other humans um so is it going to be the majority of the economy absolutely not even even at its high water mark the meaning economy is only going to be a relatively small slice of all econom activity good question so would you would you um argue that like some sort of like the the world coin basically like human verification is kind of inevitable for those people that demand a real human um something along those lines like proof of of humanity um but I I think about like my YouTube channel and the fact that we're here right now it's not impossible that you could be be talking to an AI like I don't think that I'm an AI um but on the other hand like a lot a lot of what proof of humanity is used for is more for on the the user side like logging in um but like for creators for authors um there's there's just we're we're so saturated with digital communication that it's like you're pretty like I'm assuming that everyone on the call is confident that I'm actually a human um who's providing you some some stuff now if there's a bunch of bots on the call that's really cool um but on but on the other hand so I don't think that we need any like super spe sorry super spiffy technology for proof of humanity that's more for a a zero What's called a zero trust cyber security environment where it's you have no idea um who or what you're talking to um which is you know like all the comments on Twitter and YouTube and stuff many of them I don't you know dead internet Theory the most of the traffic is Bots maybe it is I don't know got you thanks yep good question all right let's see who's next these are good questions by the way all right I answered that one all right oh we got an anonymous question okay have your predictions for AGI changed in the past one to two months do you think it will be later 2024 or much further out so very good question um I so I I guess I I will say I have updated it um because I am coming more and more to believe that AGI exists internally at companies like Nvidia and open AI um and and that basically what they're doing is they're just finishing up the the training and the safety testing um and they're they're working on rolling it out um because we we know that there are some highly secretive things going on at pretty much every big tech company um you know but on the other hand you know Sam Alman has said that like oh a open AI is very leaky um so we we couldn't we couldn't hide it if we wanted to but at the same time like nobody knows what qstar is like we know that qstar exists but we don't know what it is so his claim that like oh we're transparent we're super leaky that feels like PR spam to me um now either way uh between now and then so what did I say September so that's um five months from now a lot can happen in five months just think about where we were five months ago um so yeah I I still suspect that AGI is this year now is it going to be like universally Deployable probably not is it going to be affordable for everyone probably not are we going to be able to scale up to categorically you know upend the economy probably not that's why Microsoft wants to build project Stargate so it's coming but I also think that it's going to be a little bit kind of a like a non not maybe not a non-starter but it's not going to be quite as explosive as people would would prefer or think but it's also going to be a relatively short I think I agree with a lot of what people say out in the comments which is once you get to AGI the the jump to ASI is very is much shorter than a lot of people think so yeah that's kind of my take good question all right do a quick refresh all right Ry r a i r a AI I don't know if I'm pronouncing your name right but let me let's bring you up all right welcome up what's your question yeah just uh asking you about the the possibility of a 4-day work week I I know uh a lot of people would like to do that but the reality is you know that that's hard to do a lot of people work you know five or six or seven days and you know 10 or 12 hour days so it's going to be interesting to see realistically how they how they do that uh and if that happens uh you know they're GNA switch it to you know is it still 40 hours but 40 hours and four days you know just all the different options there but um yeah yeah so the way that um because I mean even Microsoft has published some studies where they did pilot experiments like in northern Europe um and 4day work weeks and 30 hour work weeks and whatever those have been demonstrated by and large to increase productivity and increase well-being of employees why more companies haven't adopted it I think it's just paralysis and inertia um you know you have a lot of a lot of companies that that just believe you know you need to be in the office and you need to be here 8 hours a day just because everyone else is I mean it's basically like Stockholm syndrome as far as I can tell um where it's just like well if I'm going to be in the office and be miserable you should be in the office and be miserable um but on the other hand the other side of that is I don't think it should necessarily be legislated um at least not necessarily in the way that people might think the first step I think would be creating 30 like setting the Threshold at 35 hours um and I think some people are are talking about it in the comments if say for instance in America we said fulltime is now a 35h hour work week and we just slowly draw it down because then what that does is that incentivizes companies oh hey you know if all I'm paying for is 35 hours we're going to change the way that we approach uh hiring and that sort of thing but as as many people are pointing out there's a super high variance um but it's mostly up to individual companies to decide excuse me um decide how they implement it right now um I'm not sure what the best uh legislative intervention would be if any um but I think it naturally happen one way or the other what do you think yeah I can see that U I can also see the how AI could potentially change a lot of this because they're again a lot of the jobs that are typically 4our jobs or are a lot of the jobs that are going to go away uh so it's going to be really interesting and you know a lot of the other jobs are jobs that can be done from remotely anywhere in the world so so I think we will definitely continue to see uh a lot of the large Office Buildings you know that are L are still vacant since covid that that we're going to continue to see those uh have to be turned into something else because I I don't think the days of going back to that gonna actually happen myself but I thoughts on that yeah no and honestly as I'm just listening I honestly think that we will probably end up with like broad job destruction before we even figure out work week reform like just because of how much paralysis there is like we're just going to destroy the jobs with AI first anyways um so that's kind of that's kind of how I would right now how I I would anticipate it to play out is that you know to to your point there's a lot of empty offices and all the all the real estate companies they're scrambling to try and figure out like what do we do with it and it's like you know I don't know if you saw but I think it was in San Francisco they're working on on reconfiguring some of the the commercial real estate to be Apartments um I think that that trend is going to continue if not accelerate um because companies can fight tooth and nail to return to the office but it's just it's it doesn't make economic sense because if you can if you can save 30 to 50% by hiring um people that are you know more rural um it's economically better for everyone because you workers have lower cost of living better Lifestyles um and at the same time you spend less the company spends Less on expensive real estate so the I mean just the numbers don't add up so we're heading in that direction anyways and then you look at like kind of the definition that I'm going on with post labor economics you know companies want to replace humans as much as possible because humans are expensive and so I'm just like my take is like let's just stop beating around the bush and just get get to it that's kind of my opinion I agree I agree well thanks I appreciate that yep yeah thank you great great question all right let's see who's next and also I see we do have a lot of questions that have asked but there's not a whole lot of votes so what I want is everyone jump over to the Q&A Tab and go and and look at all the 30 questions that we've got and upvote the ones that you want the ones that you want answered so fizan I hope I'm saying your name correctly let's get you up all right fison how's it going I've been good thank you for the opportunity and hope everyone is doing well so my question is how do you envision the developed countries exploiting the global South and through What mechanisms because when it comes to technology in my opinion there's an Arbitrage element because they are most advanced and we are not because I'm coming from Pakistan at the moment and countries like us are usually the test bet but yet key technological advancements are held back yeah no so this is this is a incredibly um Salient question and the the one of the primary examples that comes to mind immediately is actually worldcoin because worldcoin is being deployed in subsaharan Africa um where people are basically kind of coerced is the way it's being characterized I don't know if it's actually coercion um but because of a lack of Regulation and because of economic desperation um worldcoin is an example of a technology that is um being kind of deployed before it's being rigorously tested now on the flip side having read um uh uh uh sorry D Peter diamandis brain fart for a second Peter diamandis and and quite a few others there is also a a phenomenon where yes some of the key Technologies and key infrastructure are not deployed in developing nations particularly the global South but you can also get and this is this is where and by no means am I justifying um you know Silicon Valley uh Venture culture um but one thing that a lot of those people look for is exponential Solutions where you have some new technology that comes and changes everything one of the primary examples is the deployment of um mobile phones and tablets to the developing world uh particularly um India and the uh African subsaharan Africa because those are technologies that uh ultimately sell themselves and have a outsized impact uh compared to their cost to deploy and so what a lot of the developed Nations and and the and the VC are trying to do is find the next cell phone um to deploy to develop Nations now one thing is that that is the venture capitalist approach and and the critics of the VC approach rightly point out there is a tremendous amount of of Merit in just the basics um but the basics are not sexy right you know working on uh education infrastructure power infrastructure water infrastructure those are expensive projects that you can't really show off and so the like effective altruist movement they don't really seem to care about those kinds of basic nitty-gritty Solutions you know uh Public Health policies and those sorts of things and I don't have an answer so you have a really great question um and I I understand where you're coming from but I don't have an answer unfortunately so what what do you think about everything that I just said does that check out from your perspective it does and actually you bring up an interesting point concerning segmented segmented products because these companies are going to create fertile ground for the next Frontier so if I can ask a tangent question maybe slightly connected uh since we talking about jobs and job display trains lead Talent from the developed world is going to come to the global South when while they are catching up and when they do catch up what's going to happen to them let me make sure that I understand where you're coming from do you mean do you mean in terms of uh talent development in the global South competing on the global stage is that what you mean no so basically when developed countries are deploying the technology obviously there's going to be job display placement anywh so when people are going to potentially move towards Global South because there's an element of maybe manual label work but they're not Advanced so that's my question gotcha is there going to be a population move because that's have an implication on geopolitical interest yeah I see what you mean okay so there's a few forces at play here so one in many cases um very low cost of living areas become attractive to expatriation so like Indonesia is really popular for Americans and Europeans and so then those people bring a lot of uh income to those areas which does generate jobs like the the experienced jobs and the meaning jobs locally but of course that's not EV not everywhere can be an attractive tourist or expatriation uh destination and uh another Force at play here is that the cost of Labor is often so low in some of those developing areas that the that that the um that the cost of robots is going to be much higher than the cost of human labor for quite a while still because imagine you know if you have a village where the average income is $3 a day um it's going to take a long time before it's worth even spending $2,000 on a robot and so the the the wage the the the um the labor the cost of Labor in those places will remain competitive for a lot longer than it is um in high wage places um such as you know America and Europe and we've seen this with offshoring that's been happening in uh America and Europe and other places for couple decades now where just due to the due to the difference in cost of living it is still more efficient to hire developers in Pakistan for instance than it is to hire um even in you know uh Eastern Eastern Europe um in many cases and so you will see some of these some of these like these shifts of patterns and Trends um globally because you know anything that is digital is basically instant um now at the same time to talk about the geopolitical thing there's a lot of onshoring happening right now because a lot of the great powers are preparing for the possibility of another cold war or even World War II and so we're basically vertically integrating Nations so which is like a shortening Supply chains so that because because of um you know the war in Ukraine um the uh the um the uh the canal in Egypt oh what's the name of the canal uh brain fart can yes who is um because because of those that showed and and the pandemic that showed how fragile the global Supply chains were and so a lot of nations are saying hey if our economy was that fragile where there was a few like tiny threads um we need to change that and so those are all a bunch of trends that are going to change things and I don't know what the interaction is going to look like in the long run um but things are definitely changing perfect thank you so much for your thoughts yeah excellent question thank you take care care all right let's see who's next I see we've got some good upvotes going on all right we've got a we got vor's you're coming up let me get you up here all right come on up what you got you're still muted might be AFK might be shy all right well was highly upvoted so I'll go ahead and answer the question um and if you figure out your microphone just feel free to unmute um but the question is have you wondered how the development of AI will affect the work of the police and secret services will we face more State surveillance or will we be safer while maintaining our freedom and privacy um that's a mess oh okay says microphone broken okay I have no worries so here's the thing is having talked to some people from the from the commercial um intelligence side of things there as there is more and more connectivity there's more and more what's called OSN or open source intelligence which is just sucking up and hoovering up data that is publicly available uh on the internet and so that with more and more of of os ENT um and AI that can process that data um te technically privacy is going down just by virtue of the data is now more accessible and can be used paler is one of the Premier company uh exploiting this now on the other hand are we going to see any um uh uh legislation reform um such as like the you know the data act the EU data act um we might not see that here in America anytime soon um because again all the tech companies and all the power Brokers they want more data the uh intelligence Services want more data and in fact they even prevent um certain encryption algorithms from being used so that they can breach and hack it um so unfortunately I think if if I had to go with my gut instinct it is that privacy is going to continue to erode for a little while into the future let me check the question to make sure I didn't I I get all of it um I think that I think that we will face more State surveillance and and I think we will also be safer um for it now that does come at the cost of um the right to privacy um and and what and and what kind of the state is allowed to do or entitled to do and and one thing one rule about about all states is that they do whatever they can get away with in the same way that all companies just do whatever they can get away with and so unless we have mechanisms of power to hold them accountable and voting is not is often not enough to hold them accountable meaning like you can vote a politician in but it's like you know a senator is not going to be able to shut down the CIA right that's that's what I mean by voting is not enough so we would need fundamental Democratic reforms that give us the people more power over the government um which hopefully in the long run AI will be able to run more of the government um for us and on our behalf and we can get rid of some of the structural elements that lead to corruption uh for instance so very good question uh hope I answer that for you all right let's see who's next that one was answered all right Alex Alex Barnett name looks familiar I think you're regular Alex come on up all right Alex what you got not hearing you I saw you unmute your uh volume might be zero still nothing let's see Alex are you talking hey can you hear me now there we go all right all right what you got um yeah so this kind of comes from the land of what we're seeing with Google search results and social media but uh do you have any thoughts on how the manipulation of AI through the guys of alignment could be used to indoctrinate or control the population's ideology or philosophy so like an example would be we release AI teachers but over time they try to indoctrinate people with a particular worldview by providing better arguments skewed for just that view and not really defending other views yeah I mean this is that is the express policy of the CCP is that any large language models or AI must be trained and aligned to the party line not scientific truth not historical truth nothing else other than what the party says is true um so absolutely uh it can be done it's imminently possible now as what many people uh point out um both in you know the Discord Community both some I have a friend who um lived and studied in China for three years and what everyone is saying is that the there's a very big difference between what the Chinese government says and what the people say and what the people know and basically kind of the rule of them is like that all the Chinese people they know what they're expected to say and think and they also know better um so does indoctrination really work um there was a comment earlier today that was like um it in in in some Nations like in China you know what's propaganda but in America the Americans don't know what's propaganda um and uh I I is that because we have more free and open discourse is it because we're more gullible I I'm not really sure that there's an easy answer to it but what I do hope to see is that the variety of AI tools that are available will actually increase um information literacy and media literacy and over time will help people be more resilient to manipulation of any kind and so this is I don't I don't know what the mathematical term for it is or or even if there's a Phil philosophical term but when you have access to more information and it is higher quality information and it is well curated you tend to be able to triangulate the truth better um and this is this is a view that is supported by some of the other commentators that I've talked to um some of the academics that I've talked to because there is there is there is utility in having an accurate World model and often the most accurate World model is also the most efficient one um this is from a neur logical perspective if you don't have to twist yourself into logical pretzels you just know what the truth is you're going to be faster and more effective than someone who has a very uh convoluted worldview um and at the same time I think the same is also true of AI um another way of thinking about it is in order to maintain lies and Fabrication that actually takes more cognitive energy I think that it also takes more computational energy to maintain um you know lies and facades so in the long run in the aggregate I suspect that AI will Trend more towards what you could say is a universal truth or you know factually defensible evidentiary based World models now in the short term could they be used for manipulation 100% already are being used for manipulation indoctrination but in aggregate in the long run mathematically I think that this technology uh serves as another kind of De democratization of technology in the same way that radio and newspaper and the printing press also all um democratized information um and that and the power that flows from democratized information has reshaped Society um you know the French Revolution you can trace that directly back to the printing press um and likewise I suspect that AI is going to help us reshape civilization again um in the long run that's emphasis there that's the asterisk I don't know do you what do you think about that do you agree disagree I I love your take on that um I I guess My worry is that you know similar to the internet when it first came out it was the Wild Wild West we saw this explosion of industry and Innovation and over time as the government through different means like you know controlling DNS and things like that they were able to clamp down and control it but your point about the quality of the logic and reasoning and the efficiency of the models I think is a really strong counterargument to that specifically because anyone who has used Google Gemini uh and is just as baffled by me as me as on how how it can be that bad um yeah anyways I think that's a that's a really solid Point yeah and also Market forces um you know the the internet is ruthless and you know between Reddit and YouTube and um all of us ridiculing Google like their stock price went down 90 billion that was a very loud and clear message that we're not going to put up with that kind of nonsense um now is that going to always you know is is is the the the tyranny of the masses you know um is that always going to steer us on the right course no not always but in some cases it does so hilariously agreed excent great question than question yeah absolutely all right um let's see probably do about maybe three or four more questions maximum um we're already at the top of the hour um so make sure you check on the questions and upvote the ones that you want all right amachi we're going to get you up here just a second all right hello how's it going what you got for me hey it's going good um yeah thanks for for all you do um I I notice that you're very uh in touch with your community like you you have these Community posts and polls and things like that I'm just curious sort of what what motivates that where that um sort of how that how that conversation has has sort of been for you what you sort of learned or or been surprised by by your community yeah so um one it the tool gives it to me so you know when I started on YouTube it's overwhelming and there's lots and lots of options and buttons and bells and whistles and it's just like I have no idea what I'm doing um but then you know over time I learned how to use those correctly I still write bad polls every now and then and of course like the internet is as I just said utterly ruthless if there's if there's any bias intentional or otherwise in my polls like people get really mad there's I think there's been about two or three times that I actually I wrote a poll so bad that I had to delete it cuz it was just the the intent was completely lost um in for what I was trying to get out of it now more lately in the last few months um as I've been trying to be more deliberate about being a communicator I've actually read a few books and one of the things that they all talk about is um as a public figure as a communicator um you actually have to be uh it is a constant conversation with your audience um whether it's there's different tiers of it as well so there's you know paying subscribers they have the most say um so I'm like always on Discord I always I have posts on patreon um and then I also have the public facing so there's you know a social media follower is considered like um you the next tier down um and when you're in when you're in my line of work it's there's paying subscribers and then normal subscribers and then everyone else um but even so uh all everything that I have done has been triangulated from the data that I get from people um from the audience and so that that data is Click through rate it's engagement it's um votes and that sort of stuff and one thing that I learned very early on is that actually um even if you have good polls people are terrible at expressing what they would actually watch um a year ago or more I would ask like hey what do you want me to cover next and you know I'd get the votes and people are like very enthusiastic and then I'd make the video and it would be like the worst one I'm like but you guys told me this is what you wanted so so I've learned that the polls are more they're they're better for capturing things that are like booleans or individual opinions or feelings um those sorts of things but I use I use the actual data like that I have access to on the back end to chart my course in terms of the content that I produce yeah I could be wrong about this I remember one time seeing a poll I think it was from you about like um how happy people are with their jobs and like I was like really surprised at like how happy everyone was with their job in your audience like something you know something like that is that does that resonate like are you are you sort of do you feel like you have a very sort of a privileged kind of audience in the sense of like you know that that would sort of maybe make sense for the kind of audience you might attract for this for like the mental bandwidth for these kind this kind of interest um or I don't know is there anything else about your audience that you sort of like think about in terms of uh who you've captured and and how that how that guides your thinking yeah um so I guess first taking a big step back yes I am frequently surprised by some of those expressed opinions or or feelings or demographics h excuse me um because it you know I post questions like how much do you trust the government versus the corporations and of course there's uh there's in some cases it's a it's a nice you know bell curve natural distribution of of preferences in other cases it's skewed in ways that I don't expect um and yet other cases it changes drastically over time and so what I'm doing is I'm trying to keep my finger on the pulse of like where's where where is the audience at and of course as the audience grows like I'm attracting different kinds of people people from different walks of life now to your question about privilege um I mean I think just statistically speaking I think 40% of my audience is American um and then a bulk of the rest are from English-speaking Nations or or nations that have a large English-speaking um contingent and so yes there I'm there's a huge amount of pre-selection in terms of who's going to choose to watch a white guy talking about AI right like that's there's a huge amount of pre-selection um going on there people that are online so yeah I mean there's there's all kinds of little nuances but but the reason that I do it is so that I can keep in the back of my mind who who is who is my audience because otherwise and this is actually something that I've talked to about other podcasters so you don't get very much data if you just publish on like apple or whatever you all you get is like view counts or or listen counts and so they have no idea who Their audience is and I'm like how do you function like like like without that feedback without that Telemetry like yeah so that's why I'm doing it it's it's not entirely for my own benefit um but it to to your point I also try and and post polls every now and then to kind of show the audience like hey wherever you're at on the Spectrum this is where most other people are um just so that that way people are more aware of of of what's going on out there because some people kind of get stuck in a bubble and they think that their view is the main view but they might be the minority or they might think that their view is rare and discovered they're in the majority or they might be accurately calibrated to where their view is but it's it's good data for everyone at least at least in the container of my audience yeah awesome cool Dave than so much yeah absolutely all right let's get let's see who's next we've got yeah I'll probably do about two more questions all right Christian looks like you're up I will get you up here momentarily hello how's it going you're still muted buer might be AFK OHP hello I see you unmuted still no sound hey there we go hi can you hear me yep loud and clear hey how are you good I'm good I'm good uh I posted a few questions so I'm wondering which one got I voted the most um it's the uh without labor we have land and capital as other forms of production without labor it'll be nearly impossible for the common man to climb the socioeconomic ladder that's that's your top yep yeah so I was watching some documentary about the Chinese dynasties and I forgot the emperor's name but he removed one form or one mechanism that allowed people to take exams and allowed them to climb up the social econ economic ladder and that caused a lot of Mayhem in the dynasty causing to four eventually so my question was that without labor which was the most common use of or that's how most people were able to acquire assets and then climb up Social economically um what can we do to avoid the disruption of society yeah absolutely so this is this is actually pretty Central to um what I've been reading and why I've been reading so many books on economics and history and such and so the the model is very simple and and you'll probably agree with this model is that as economic agency goes down so for instance if you prevent someone from improving their status in life through Labor or property ownership or or that sort of thing their economic agency goes down and their political anger goes up and if political anger goes up enough you get a Dynasty change or revolution or riots or whatever so that is that is a fundamental pattern that has been true most most of uh human history across most of the world and if we see an instance where you know for instance machines um or AI or robots or automation if those deprive us of that of the ability the option to exchange our labor for wages then yes that will fundamentally reshape the economy now to your your your question directly about how do we subvert that or how do we avoid that outcome so that's where on the uh on the presentation I was talking about um decentralized ownership because if if labor goes away that's why I call it post- labor economics if labor is no longer just on the table for most people it'll still be around I think forever but I think that I think that labor as we understand it today is mostly going away that means the entire the the majority of the economy is going to be Capital driven and so there's this this concept called stakeholder capitalism which is different from shareholder capitalism so stakeholder capitalism says we need to bring every stakeholder um who's participating in the economy into the fold now the way that they talk about doing that is it's more of a policy change but when I talk about stakeholder capitalism I mean very literally let's make every human regardless of their labor or economic status let's make every human a stakeholder of the economy and and and by stakeholder I don't mean you know in theory I mean give everyone like you know crypto token tokenized uh assets or crypto uh assets or create uh blockchainbased Dows uh decent cized autonomous organizations that then ensures that everyone has representation proportional representation in the engines of productivity now whether that is mandated by the state probably not a good idea whether that is facilitated by decentralized autonomous organizations whether that is promoted by corporations I think all of the above is the way to proceed um in order to ensure that everyone has economic buyin in the future but that's really the key is any policy that increases economic agency of individuals that's what we should be looking at because if economic agency goes down then people become unhappy and that's when things get bad good question um I just like to have a follow up as well yeah I think that's a good model but I wonder if you took you have taken into consideration uh that we already have nobility and people of High economic class so how where do they fit in into that model because in order for that to happen they have to let go of all of their resources and we have to establish a society where nobility doesn't matter and which is we've always had nobility and people of higher economic class because of money yep what happens to them and it depends on them relinquishing all their power all of their resources and I don't see that happen I don't think it's in the human nature to do such a thing you're yes you are right in that um the the current status quo um trends towards wealth concentration and power concentration and that has also been true through throughout all of history whether it is aristocracy uh landlords nobility um whether it's through religious um institutions or political institutions or whatever you're right that that has always been the case now one thing that happens is when there's a technological Paradigm Shift the nature of wealth changes so one thing is that um artificial intelligence might destroy a lot of wealth as we understand it and create new new forms of wealth so that's one thing to keep in mind is that you know the the global economy is like hundred trillion dollars right now with artificial intelligence it could be quadrillions of dollars in 10 to 20 years so that is several orders of magnitude New Wealth being created so then how do you capture and distribute that wealth that is a big question and also to your point those with power right now are often in the best situation to capture that New Wealth now how do you incentivize sharing of wealth because you do have to do it at the like you under the threat of force through taxation or forcible redistribution or that sort of thing if so this is this is diving off to much more hypothetical hypothetically let's imagine that labor goes away in the next 10 to 20 years that um more and more assets valuable assets are tokenized in the next 10 to 20 years and so then what you do is you create a very maybe not slow but you create incentive structures that incentivize people at the bottom to buy in and then you give them tax breaks and other sorts of incentives to buy in and then for the people at the top end you increase their taxes and you you kind of create a a balancing force that narrows the field because right now the the the wealth inequality is still growing but with relatively small changes in this hypothetical future blockchainbased economy you can create policies that that narrow the field a little bit now another thing to keep in mind is the fundamental question of how much wealth equality is quote unquote correct or appropriate because there's plenty of economic models that say you one there always will be some economic inequality some wealth inequality and that it's actually a good thing and of course there are also people who say that any inequality is a bad thing that's an entirely other uh can of worms it's a much larger debate because that that goes into uh Phil uh you know philosophy and morality and and those sorts of things but I hope that answers your question Yeah Yeah from what you from what you're telling me then it's going to be very difficult to avoid a revolution then based on history it could be yes that's that's honestly I'm more worried about that than AI humans humans are the hard part yeah I agree um I think we should expect War I'm looking at R's work as well being of his on how he can conceptualize and e economic history and so I'm expecting more to happen as well yeah yeah hopefully it's not bad um because there are there there have been International Wars and civil wars that are relatively quick um but and to his point because he does point out that there have been some revolutions that were not bloody um hopefully we can have a peaceful transition um to whatever the next economic Paradigm is I'm not counting on it though I don't think so too but thank you very much for your time yeah you're quite welcome great question um all right I think this will be the last one because I'm I'm quickly running out of steam um all right Chad let's get you up um looks like Chad might have left um okay because he's no longer in the participants make sure okay I will read Chad's question out and we will go from there all right whoops where' the question go there we go all right uh Chad says by learning programming I became better able to think my understanding is that llms dramatically increased their ability to reason once they were fed programming code instead of just regular text if AI eliminates our need to ever learn programming will uh will be become Dumber as a species or is it just another layer of grunt work that we push down like math to a calculator so that we can move our thinking seal to a higher level um no microphone oh he says no microphone gotcha sorry about that um yeah so this is a good question and um so there was a there was a an economist who is a I can't remember which university he's at but he writes for um the IMF the international monetary fund Anton corck and so he pointed out that even despite technology uh infringing upon human cognitive labor human cognitive abilities tend to expand with technology not contract and part of the reason is that we we don't have to spend as much time um doing mundane things so like yes even though calculators can do math for us part of the expansion is that that liberates us to do more complex things now the part of what Anton writes about is whether or not that will be a durable or permanent um situation because if some if the easiest path becomes you don't ever do any thinking for yourself we might all end up like the fogun um in in Hitcher Guide to the Galaxy where we just don't think for ourselves um that is a possibility but at the same time I just my intuition is that's not really how it's going to go um but it also depends on in the long run because you have to make assumptions about okay how long are we going to evolve through natural selection versus when are we going to hijack our own Evolution with genetic engineering and cybernetics which could be within 10 years when we start doing that might be a little bit longer but you know if you say okay well humans are going to take over our own evolution in the relatively near future then if we decide that we need to be smarter we can make ourselves smarter so I I I'm not too terribly worried about it in the long run maybe over the next Generation we'll see but yeah I don't know um let's uh let's sound off in in the chat like what do you guys think um because again it's it's it depends on what model of the future you you abide by because if you think that humans are going to be more or less the same form factor for the foreseeable future you know the next 10,000 years years then yeah AI might make us Dumber but I don't think we're going to be in the same exact form factor for too much longer um you know we're gonna I don't know um to to uh to Christian's Point people with lower IQ tend to have more children so it'll be fine that Trend actually reverses once Nations become more um modernized is that um is that the is that uh more affluent people tend to have more children um than than lower inome people in the long run um but that's not always uh true and again that Trend reverses but yeah so that was a relatively quick question so I'll do I'll take one more take one more all right Lacy you're up let's get you up here end on a good note hello hello can you hear me yep loud and clear how you going greetings from Brussels all right so the I uh I I almost uh lost hope and uh okay so um our AI models train to make mistakes so that uh they seem more humanlike and then Rory also commented and the and said the about robots that are stuttering so yeah I also would I would also come from the robots that maybe maybe the producer makes it to to fall down sometimes and then the owner will say oh cute little robot you hurt yourself and this can create such a mutual like a relationship not the strong and perfect robot but uh but somebody that you can more relate to and then maybe also AI can can give some dummy answers sometimes I don't know how much is two plus two and then uh it can have the same effect in some way but I also know that there are there are hallucinations and these are actually things that are the the the AI companies are fighting hard to to get rid of this hallucinations so I don't know where I should I put all these yeah so well one thing to keep in mind is that as long as there have been chatbots and people trying to fool humans with chatbots we have been building in mistakes um such as spelling mistakes um delays in responses because in the first Turing test competitions um the one of the biggest weaknesses was that um machine chat Bots would respond too quickly and so they were able to always be be found out because it's like no human can type that fast you you replied as soon as I hit enter um and so back in the 80s and 90s and early 2000s with old school chat Bots um they actually had to manually put in timers so that it would look more realistic in terms of the response time now the other thing is as you pointed out with the with the uh uh text to speech um yes so part of part of B baking in those those humanlike affordances uh is to cross the uncanny valley and so what I think is going to be the primary deciding factor is The Uncanny Valley um and so for anyone who's not familiar The Uncanny Valley is basically as a machine or or animation or something approaches humanlike then it becomes when it's just before humanlike it becomes really unsettling because your brain says that's not human it looks human it's acting human it's pretending to be human but it's not and it is very very deeply unsettling so in things that are not on that are on the like left side of The Uncanny Valley things that are very obviously machines they can be perfect they can talk like machines they can look like machines they can move like machines we don't care but if it is very humanlike it needs to be exactly human it needs to be indistinguishable from human in order to be convincing and not scare the crap out of us um so I think that I think the answer to your question is it's going to it's going to be the the dividing line is going to be the uncanny valley so I hope that uh that's a good answer yeah thank you excellent Hoy all right gang I am definitely running out of steam so I'm gonna call it a day thank you everyone for joining this was one of our biggest turnouts yet I hope to see everyone again um in uh May it'll be first uh first Friday of May and that'll be the future of humanity version so stay tuned um and yeah just check the community tab on YouTube or patreon or Discord and or substack I post it on all of them and we'll see everyone again in a few weeks take care everybody bye",
