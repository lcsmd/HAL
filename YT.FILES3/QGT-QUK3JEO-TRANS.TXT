  "transcript": "with the cad GPT API you can build your own AI app in a matter of minutes even if you know nothing about python or programming the first thing you need is an API key you have to go to platform. open.com and use the same exact login as you would on chbd and boom we're inside now go on to the left and click on API keys if you've never been here before you might need to verify your phone number now after you verifi the phone number it should look something like this now as you can see I already have some API Keys over here and I also have an organization David Andre you will probably have this empty and that's fine all we have to do is create a new secret key and as the name suggests it's secret so do not share this with anybody so let's do tutorial and create secret key now as it says you won't be able to view it again so make sure to copy it I'm going to go into vs code and put it as a comment which is actually not a good practice so instead what I'm going to do is I'm going to create the environment uh file right away open AI API key and assign this now you might be thinking but David what are you going to build well I want to make an app like blinkist you know it gives you book summaries now obviously we won't have fancy UI like this but we will use GPD 4 to create custom book summarizer where we can give it a topic and it gives us all di mentions of that topic in a 200 Page book now the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to import some packages OS we'll be using this to access the environment variable Pi PDF 2 will be you know processing the PDF files through that open AI obviously this is for accessing the GPD for API VSS code is not recognizing these packages and that's because I have not in sold them now actually open AI if you go to documentation quick start they have an excellent guide on getting started right by the way you can always ask Che gbts to install these packages what you would normally do is go into terminal and create a new terminal and do you know pip install open AI but actually I'm using K here pip install open AI so as you can see it's installing the all the packages pip install P PDF 2 and we also need n now this one is a little different this one is uh pip install python Das donf okay and as you can see it's no longer highlighted which is good the next thing is we need to load the environment variable because right now we have it saved but it's not actually accessible in the main.py file so I'm going to paste this line of code all right so let's set up the key variables we will need for this the first one is the model you know the language model if we go into documentation and go into models you'll see like all the different models open air offers obviously we going to go for GPT 4 but yeah as you can see it's 128,000 token window which is four times bigger than CH GPT and this is like only one of the main reasons why apis are awesome like apis have made building AI apps 100 times easier imagine if there were no apis like from the one from open AI or Google Deep Mind like imagine if there wasn't an any API available we would have to build those language models from scratch or use open source ones and run like inference locally that's much more complicated than just using open a API so this has made building AI apps 100 times easier in fact people are building entire companies with this exact method let's look at perplexity valuation this AI startup is valued at $520 million that's half a billion dollars and it was built on top of the gp4 API like knowing how to use API will give you a massive advantage in the AI Revolution once AGI is created it won't matter what your income is or what college degree you have the thing that will matter by far the most is what you know and who you know this is precisely why I created the new Society a community of people at The Cutting Edge of AI so if you want to be among the people who are building the future make sure to join first link in the description now let's continue setting up the key variables we have the model but we also need the temperature which 0.7 is the default one inside of jgpt I'm going to use 0.3 to make the model a little more deterministic little less r random we also need uh Max tokens let's do like 500 that's pretty standard I think and I'm going to also set the topic which is going to be what the AI makes the summary on so we can leave this empty for now now we have the key variables actually I'm going to create one more file and that's going to be prom. py and this is going to be where we store the proms so these are the proms I'm working with and there are two proms right so it's intimidating but it's kind of simple at the same time there's a system message which you know has the custom instructions system prompt whatever you want to call it and then we have a function that creates a prompt the reason why we have this is that I can reference the book from the main python file and I can also change the topic so this is a variable and it can change the reason I have to do such prompt engineering is because if you don't do this the AI will actually refuse to give you book summaries because it's copyrighted material so you have to go try hard and like convince it that it's your own text as you can see like I've over the past 3 years I have dedicated myself to this work like you literally have to create a story that this is your book now the book I've chosen to summarize is the almanak of Naval ravikant by Eric Jorgenson this one you know has a free pdf online 242 pages and it's honestly one of the best books I've ever read okay so now we have the PDF right here there's a lot of garbage in here and that's why we installed the PDF package is because we're going to use that to actually read the PDF because it's not as simple as reading a txt file okay yeah I read the PDF file so let's do an empty book variable file path equals and then we do naval PDF you know what I'm going to put this on hold and I'm going to do a test API call and in here we need to do system message and we we need to reference this system message to do that we have to import prompts so let's go in here and import prompts and then we can do prompt. system message beautiful obviously we also need the main prompt prompt. generate prompt now actually in here I'm going to pass the book which I've deleted so let's put it back in empty variable for now and topic for a reference of the of the topic that's I mean I spent a good hour on this just trying to convince gbd4 that it's fine to summarize the book it's good to create a helper function and make it a bit simpler also it's smart to go into the documentation because every few months this gets changed quite a bit we have the two first two lines and we can copy the rest paste it here and I'm going to comment it out boom now we can name the function like I don't know get summary right so let's follow the official documentation completion equals client. chat. completions doc create and actually in here we could do it like this you know but I think I'm going to simplify it that way it's like much easier to see what's actually going on so let's go back to the function messages equals messages we also do temperature equals temperature and Max tokens equals Max tokens and now we have to return the completion return completion choices message and this is not everything because we only need the content because if we go into API and actually go into chat you can see how it looks like this is how the response looks so this is how it looks right and what we really need is we need choices the First Choice index zero so we have that you know completion. choices zero and then we need the message message and specifically the content we don't need the roll we need the content so this is how we access exactly you know the good part and this should be the main part done so we can actually delete this and you know we need to print summary to test it out let's do something simple right so this is just a string we can do you are a helpful assistant this is classic and for here you know you can say like list out 10 facts about AI whatever and if we do this we should get an API response hopefully oh there it is we've gotten a response from gbd4 Turbo and actually what's fun let's go into um API keys and let's go into what is it usage okay usage this is my current spend for today so we will see how much it costs at the end hopefully all of this is simple by the way what you can do if like anything doesn't make sense just go into CH GPT and say explain the following code as if I'm a beginner boom paste it in here and it will explain it you don't even have to copy paste it you can just screenshot it boom explain every line of code and then yeah you can just paste a screenshot from any video you watch like GPD vision is so amazing now the topic actually let's set it now so I don't forget let's do money because I know that's mentioned in the book like you can consume an entire 242 page book in a matter of minutes once you have this running we also need the file path as we had it before Naval PDF and now we need to open it this I'm going to delete because we actually need to remove the first like 23 pages and the last 30 pages for some reason when the AI sees contents it doesn't like that so I literally had to remove like 53 pages from the book you know unfortunately we can't have it so simple you know this is how we open the file at the file path we save it as a file variable then we do reader which is a new variable and we assign to it PDF reader from the library next we need to do total pages and that equals to length of reader. pages and for starting page we need to start page equals 23 and end page equals total Pages minus 30 now we need a for Loop and as you can see cop palet is already suggesting that for us but let's you know let's write it out why not for for every page number in range and you know again this is range of numbers starting with start page 23 and end page with a total Pages minus 30 and then for every page we should do page equals reader. Pages page number and then we do simply we append the page to our book with you know we can do a new line character or just a space let's do a space and actually should be book obviously so now this should give us a book variable with the entire text of the PDF print book to test it out now as you can see it clearly worked because we have the entire book printed in here we have to change our messages to system message and to prompt and then we use use this simple function let us change the topic summary on money happiness Fitness like the navel book is about a lot of topics again I definitely recommend you read it it's amazing book shout out Eric Jorgenson we should have everything in order let's do a test run and fingers crossed that the AI doesn't refuse because we're literally pasting in I mean we can just go to wordcounter.net and see how many words this is obviously we removed some pages but still 46,000 words so we removed probably like it's probably like 40,000 words which to convert to tokens we have to do this is 53,000 tokens so like half of the context window of gb4 and as you can see we got a response and let's actually see how much money we've spent let's go into billing usage refresh it probably still needs to update but yeah it's going to be like you know1 or $2 at most one thing I want you to understand is that building apps with apis is a massive opportunity there are thousands of small niches that big companies like open AR or deep mind will never go after niches Industries where you actually have an unfair Advantage a lot of experience so you know what the people need like launching a startup has never been easier open air tells you everything and also we have this amazing tool cgbd as you can see it broke down every single line of code and explained it you don't even have to know programming you can just learn while you're building something now I'm going to upload all of this code including the proms in here into this module in my community where I also upload all my custom instructions great custom instructions from others all the code from my past videos the projects I've built in unity my custom gpds as well as a bunch of other stuff if you want to prepare for the AI Revolution and don't want to be left behind like most people will make sure to join for Link in the description",
