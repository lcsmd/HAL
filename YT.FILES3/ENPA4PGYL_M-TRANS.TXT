  "transcript": "i'm going to be covering the most awesome high-energy fantastic tremendously educational real estate subject out there uh i i wouldn't go that far i will be discussing ccnars that always accompany an hoa that's just something we have to cover i'm sorry but it has to be done it's kind of like eating your in your broccoli but i will be discussing some information that i'm sure you haven't heard of before hi i'm gordon baker with re max alliance group and today we're going to be talking about ccnars which stands for covenants conditions and restrictions and some things you really really need to be aware of why because the majority of arizona residents live in a community that has an hoa as of 2017 56 percent of all arizona single-family dwellings had an hoa and as of for all the homes built since 2000 since 2000 that number rises to 80 percent and that doesn't include the townhouses and condos which typically always have an hoa now as far as hoas go i tell clients sometimes you swear at them sometimes you swear by them and sometimes it's all the same day a quick note you can have ccr's attach the property but not be in an active hoa that's why it's so important to check the title report for the existence of ccnr's and typically they would be architectural or use restrictions now check schedule b in the title report when you receive this this coveted information in a resale transaction the title company has five days in which to notify the hoa of the upcoming transaction and the hoa in turn has 10 days in which to get the information supply the information to the buyer and at this point you're well into the transaction most likely after the inspection period now the contract states that the buyer is allowed five days after receipt of the information from the seller or homeowners association to provide written notice of any items disapproved now that's this weird and strange way of saying that you can cancel the contract now you'll receive this by by email so when you do review them and if you see something you just can't live with you want to cancel the contract you need to notify the title company within five calendar their days of having received the information from the hoa now for a new build you'll receive the information before you sign um sometimes it's maybe just as literally minutes before i have seen they say here's the public report here's the ccnr's and great here's the uh the contract and please sign ask for the ccnars with ample time to review them so you understand what you're willing to live by if someone came to me and said gordon i only have 10 minutes to review the ccnars come so tell me the top five areas or concerns i need to be focused on this is what my response would be first is leasing and renting now if you're concerned about short-term rounds in the neighborhood or on the other hand if you are somebody who wants to use the property uh for the purpose of a short-term rental or want to rent out any of the of the rooms please be aware of the following verbiage which you may find no lease shall be for a period rental period of less than 30 days or no owner may lease less than the entire lot and resonance situated there on and this is this is wording i actually found in ccnr's the next would be parking and vehicles and not researching this could be a major mistake for example you'll frequently find verbs such as no mobile home boat travel trailer camper shell or other similar equipment may be part kept or stored on any lot so as to be visible from the neighboring property and even more restrictive wording that i was able to find in ccr was no motor vehicle may be parked on on the streets if the space for the parking of the motor vehicle is available in any of the following the garage the driveway or driveway expansion i actually called the hoa on this and i was told that it was to prevent and eliminate overnight parking on the streets well that's not what it said and i must admit i had never seen anything as restrictive as this that i did find in a copy of h of the ccnr's no garage shall be converted to living spaces or altered or used for storage of material or other purposes so as not to allow for the parking of at least two vehicles okay what do i do with the uh the weed or the lawnmower the bicycles the christmas decorations the table saw okay moving on animals or pet restrictions an association can regulate or can restrict the type size breed and number of pests that homeowner may keep an exception to this would be a support animal for a disabled occupant another aspect is making sure that that pets aren't bothering a neighbor common verbiage that you might find would be no animal or bird permitted on a lot shall be allowed to make an unreasonable amount of noise or become a nuisance so uh to disturb the health safety and welfare and quiet enjoyment of other lot owners now the next one is architectural restrictions this is a very very common component of ccnars essentially that you can't make any changes to the exterior paint landscaping fences walls solar collectors until the changes have been submitted to and approved by an architectural committee or review board now the last the last area that focus on is the residential use and limitations of all the ccnr's that i've reviewed they all pretty much say that the residents and the laws are devoted exclusively for residential use and this is very this is very common sense then they proceed to carve out certain conditions or exceptions whereby a uh owners can use their their their residence for in a business setting and for example i mean a lot of people are now working from especially now working working from home using a uh part of their house for for their business activity and other things i've found might say that the uh the business does not involve persons coming to the lot uh to purchase goods or services or the business is not incompatible with the residential character of the sub subdivisions subdivision and there are no employees working in or from the residents who are who is not a resident and the volume of vehicular or pedestrian traffic or parking generated by the business does not result in congestion in that or is in excess of what is customary in a residential neighborhood now bringing all these up these this is actual verbage in ccnars so that to highlight uh the need to review them a general observation the older neighborhoods seem to typically have more flexible ccnr's while the newer neighborhoods have ones that have more detailed restrictions now is the for the bonus tip that i promised from the first the beginning of the video okay just had to check the pulse because this next section tends to get my my heart pumping the pulse going a little bit faster do you know how difficult it is to change ccnr's do you think it's kind of a pain is it hard i'll tell you it's next to impossible the chances of getting ccnars changed are like that there's just a sliver of a array of hope of chance of of getting them changed that's because you need two-thirds majority of the members to change the ccnrs so the question i have is if there's laws and legislation that change the the changes that run counter to the published ccnars how do they get changed they don't so that means that when you read ccnr's there's portions of them that could be most likely be outdated also surprising is that ccnr's may contain language that goes contrary to laws and legislation that were there in place when those ccnars were written and recorded and published yep i can hear you saying no gordon that that doesn't seem right that's just counterintuitive why would they do that that sounds a little bit sketchy buckle up mijo we're going to be talking about that so let's take the example of signs now maybe can you put up a political sign it's an election year or maybe that's a little bit too controversial so let's talk about maybe what about a for sale sign uh for a lease sign that doesn't seem very offensive i won't tell you which community this comes from but the ccnars were filed and recorded in 2019 so it's rather recent in regards to signs they state no signs whatsoever including but not limited to for sale or for lease signs may be erected posted or displayed in any of in on any lot wow that sounds like the only science and they really don't like for sale or for lease signs but a couple lines down they do say except for the following signs which the association is required by applicable law to permit okay so what signs might those be now most people they're not gonna worry and try and find out what applicable uh what applicable laws apply the signs but uh let's just say that they are looking and they get lucky and they stumble across something called the arizona revised statutes and say it's their day and they stumble across they get even luckier and they find something called ars 33-1808 which states not withstanding any provision in the community documentation an association shall not prohibit or charge a fee for the use of placement of or the indoor or outdoor display of a for sale for for rent or for lease sign wow well in my mind that's a little bit confusing you prohibit a type of sign that the law says is permitted you tell me did i miss something so the takeaway from this is that if you feel like the ccnr's are overreaching and that they violate common sense i would strongly suggest a thorough reading of arizona ars title 33 chapter 16 planned communities this sets the legal boundaries as to what hoas can require of their homeowners so in summary here the more relevant things i think you should be reviewing when you look over the ccnr's leasing and renting parking and vehicles animals and pet restrictions architectural restrictions and residential use restrictions and equally important no no i think more important is to give a thorough reading to ars title 33 chapter 16 planned communities that will give you the most updated laws and legislation regarding hoas and also provide the legal boundaries that hoas should operate under now okay this went a little bit longer than i that i really thought it would but i i thought there was a good i think there's a lot of good information in here and did i did i miss anything have you had any experiences with with hoas good or bad because i think there are some good hoas out there that do help maintain the property values of of the members that they serve and if you want to be notified of

have any questions please reach out to me i'm glad to help thank you you can have ccnars on a property but not be in an active hoa that's why you can have ccnars on a property but not have but not be
