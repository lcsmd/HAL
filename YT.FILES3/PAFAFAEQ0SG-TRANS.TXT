  "transcript": "hello everybody it is my pleasure to introduce Mark matusik although I'm sure he doesn't need an introduction for so many of you I've waited so long so long to get to know this gentleman I knew about his work and I knew about him for years for years before we had the opportunity to meet and so to be able to do a course with him is really honestly I'm bubbling with excitement that said Mark welcome thank you Carolyn it's good to be here really I can't tell you I'm not I'm not just gibbering I'm telling you the truth so Mark the first thing I'd like to do is to have you share a little bit about your background with him and I'm sure most people know because you are a very well-known author sure well I I started as a reporter in when I was in my 20s in New York and I was in the pop journalism field I worked for Andy Warhol at interview magazine and I was climbing the sort of publishing ladder and then I had a life and death breakdown uh in my late 20s I was diagnosed with a disease that was supposed to kill me within five years so I quit my job I went to India I started to meditate I started to ask myself questions about what this life meant I didn't want to die as ignorant as I was at at that time and it CH it turned my life around completely uh and I realized that catastrophe you know the word catastrophe comes from the Greek for turnaround and that's that's that's that's what happened for me in my life is I I realized that I was a Seeker at heart and then what really interested me was self- knowledge and self- inquiry so I changed my professional life I did not uh end up checking out which was a lucky thing and so for the last 30 years I've really devoted myself as a writer as a teacher to the question of human unfolding and what does it mean to actually know ourselves and how do we get so lost on the path of of self knowledge by the distractions of the world yeah and so I've written a bunch of books and about 15 years ago I started teaching uh sort of halftime and I developed a method called writing to awaken which is uh using writing as a tool for self- inquiry sort of based on the idea that when you tell the truth your story changes and when your story changes your life is transformed is truth it's been my experience as a as a an individual as a writer and as a teacher so I love doing that so I split half of my time between writing uh and between and teaching and it's it's turned out to be a great balance yes indeed and how did you become so fascinated with Ralph Waldo Emerson I was in graduate school I was quite depressed and lost and didn't really want to be in Academia and I happened to fall into a job as a research assistant for a renowned Emerson scholar I didn't know that at the time I just needed a job and so I spent a year helping her finish a book and reading his journals and going through micro fish if you remember micro absolutely absolutely sorry to say locked in the library and I he was exactly what I needed at that time what Emerson gave me that I hadn't had growing up was a vision of what was possible for human uh development I grew up in an atheist household of depressive kind of cynical um Fallen Jews I like to call them and it was for me it was an it was an Awakening to a different vision of what was possible in human life you know when he talked about God even though I didn't believe in God uh I understood what he was talking about when he said you have to listen to The Whisper only you can hear I understood what he meant so for me it was a real salvation meeting Emerson and then he's been my Touchstone ever since you know for 40 years I wherever I travel I have the little portable Emerson with me he's gotten me through so many uh tough spots and he's he continues to be a source of great great inspiration for me there's an organic holy wisdom to Emerson absolutely absolutely there's something which is what made me so excited about the course you put together which is what I would like to now discuss um in particular what what I was so thrilled about was that in my work um I really feel that the way people suffer today is very different than the way they suffered before and before and I I think the depth of suffering has shifted um and I think part of the reason is that so many people have become Seekers seeking has become mainstream and it wasn't before and I say before before the nuclear age we have morphed into people who are very monastic while not being in the monastery very spiritual while not being religious very our Inner Space is the New Frontier inner and outer space are the two New Frontiers and so people ask questions that are actually prayers you know for what reason have I been born what am I doing here what's the meaning these are these who are they asking these are prayers and so the the kind of suffering that engages is the suffering of the unanswered prayer that they think is going to come from the intellect but it doesn't what it does is awaken exactly what you are going to teach about which is well then look at your contradictions look at your forces and so talk to me about this course I'm so excited about this course because as we were saying before we came on the call contradiction is one of the primary sources of suffering for people we don't understand how we can be so generous and so stingy on any given day how we can be so benevolent and so mean uh within the course of an hour how is it that we contain these multitudes you know as as Walt Whitman put it yeah you know we contain masses of contradictions and there's nothing wrong with that provided we aren't thinking in a perfectionist uh way about what we're supposed to be or get falling into a kind of Purity mentality right so em Emerson was always saying that we need to allow for what he called the law of compensation which is that for every strength you have a weakness for every climb you have a fall for every expansion you have a contraction and getting that's part of our natural our natural cycle that's the organic de within us that's the that's the movement within us exactly and when you get that it's it ends the war and this idea that we're not supposed to have these this all of this variety all of this diversity but the fact is we have many voices inside us we have many impulses inside us and that's exactly as it should be so in this course I want to work with Emerson's teachings on nonconformity which was very important to him inconsistency you know he famously said a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little Minds H really when we when we fall into this idea that because I was this way on Monday I need to be that way on Tuesday we lose our originality we lose our spontaneity and we lose the uh freedom of experimenting and taking risks that's the other thing he said is that your life is like a laboratory for experiments allow yourself to experiment and don't be afraid of making mistakes you know what I love so much about this Mark is that somehow the idea of becoming consistent and Perfection and perfectionism consistency and perfectionism have become goals that people equate with being uh healthy with being um balanced and balanced but even the the very nature of it is opposites that you manage to dance with right exactly you know so this to me is like a course that says oh wow I can I just have to learn how to dance with these two forces not filled with self-loathing because once again I've been cruel to someone I love or I I need to understand this yeah understand it and don't get lost in the story of therefore I'm a flawed person who will never attain Enlightenment or Perfection or uh communion whatever you call it no not at all I like what Annie Lamont says she says that perfectionism is the voice of the oppressor that is true an's great it's the oppressor within us yeah and and the other thing that Emerson says that's really important is that we can't touch into our own genius he believe that we all have a kind of Genius inside us a kind of tutelary deity that we're born with we can't touch into that if we're afraid of The Duality within ourselves right because that's where originality comes from right it's from that Duality and learning to use your limitations as a springboard to something that's unique and that's that's what we that's what the class is about may I ask you now to describe the four sessions sure sure absolutely absolutely uh the first session is on originality and non-conformity and and understanding that as Emerson said without being non-conformist we can't touch into our own power so we have to be willing to go against the majority to listen to uh the whisper that only we can hear and learn to be ourselves regardless of the context where we find ourselves so to not lose ourselves in the crowd to not give away our power to the crowd and as well as originality we're going to be looking at originality and genius how originality is connected to contradiction and self-acceptance and also in the first class I'll be giving an introduction to Emerson who was this guy you how did he become so great and one of the things I love about Emerson is he was such a flawed human being that's really why I fell in love with him because he struggled so hard you know this was not a guy who was destined for greatness remember that great quote when he went to visit thoro in jail and he said to thorough what are you doing in jail th said what are you doing out of jail exactly exactly exactly oh my God I loved it EXA exactly and in in the uh third class we're going to be talking specifically about thorough the second class the second uh session is about adversity and resilience and this is huge and it actually goes to what we were just saying about understanding the dark and the light the The Duality in our lives you know Emerson said he who hasn't been shown the house of pain has seen but half the universe we have to allow for pain to be a part of our our human uh our human experience and to not push it away to understand that it's actually a deepening it's a kind of fertilizer in the garden of the self and that if we're rejecting the parts of the Our Lives that are painful or adverse we Miss we miss the lessons you know he says that that a a person who cares about waking up will not miss the lessons of her or his own obstacles and losses and pain and also resilience and resilience as a natural part of the organic life that everything in nature regenerates everything in nature begins again uh and again we're you so we're talking again about the cyclical nature of things and allowing that grief has its time but not staying in grief you know grief he talks a lot about the interior versus the exterior life and EM for Emerson grief was part of the exterior life it was part of the experiential life so it's not to deny what happens to us that's hard but not to confuse it with who we are what we are essentially which is that unchanging Spirit the third session is about par Paradox and contradiction and Paradox as a spiritual practice this this is something that's always fascinating me that that life is all Paradox there's nothing in our experience that isn't paradoxical and there's nothing wrong with that you know as we're saying earlier a lot of people think oh there's something wrong with that if there's if if there's if the opposite is also true o Contra you that means that you're in the line of what's real don't you think I I don't like starting a question that way do you think as I I have often that Paradox is part of the nature of God what looks very big is actually often very small what looks very small is actually where the the the mustard seed is off in the mountain in in Disguise and and and it's the capacity to recognize and this is where humility comes in the humble can see the gift in the small yeah yeah Emerson said a great man is always willing to be little there you go and you know and it's true so Paradox understanding that two things can be true at the same time without either one canceling each other out and that's another definition of wisdom you know understanding that you know that God is great that God is small that we're both imminent and embodied and physical and material and Transcendent and numinous and spiritual and that both are true and that they don't have to one doesn't have to um we don't have to simplify everything down to a kind of linear way of seeing and all or nothing we're either all good and I I can't I think I cannot tell you what a handicap it is that people think that way because they think if I'm not totally healthy I'm not healthy exactly if I'm not totally healed then I'm not healed if I'm not totally happy then I'm not happy at all and it it's you can be both you are both you are and if you're waiting for Perfection if you're waiting to be all one thing you're going to die waiting you it doesn't happen so it's about being in what's real and what I love about Emerson is that as as spiritual as he was he was the father of transcendentalism after all he was extremely grounded in the reality of what it meant and means to be a flawed struggling limited human being right and that give that's makes his story so poignant for me if that teaching could come out of that life which was a hard life he lost his father when he was nine he lost his first wife when he was in his 20s he lost his firstborn son he was uh he was excommunicated from Harvard his you know Alma moer for being such a pagan and such a pthe right he had a lot of struggle in his life so if out of that kind of a life this Sublime teaching can come to me that gives a lot of hope uh for for all of us uh and the the fourth session is called Vitality nature and love and I'm going to be talking about hild theard of Ban's idea of veriditas The Greening power that's very Central to Emerson's teaching The Greening power the thing in US that rises up out of out of darkness and learning to harness ourselves to that by surrendering to what is and the including the painful things in our lives and the natural way of things Emerson was as we were saying uh about thoro he was he and thoro were nature buddies most of their best times were spent trumping through the woods around around uh conquer and thorough was his teacher in nature he was his real he was his his tutor so we're going to be talking about nature as it relates to self-reliance and the the philosophy that Emerson put forth and also love love as being talk about Paradox that to if we don't understand Duality and can't accept limitation in our character we can't possibly love another human being or allow love to you know come toward us you know I I love what Thomas Merton says he says prayer and love are learned in the hour when prayer becomes impossible and the heart has turned to stone isn't that the truth it's the truth it's when you can't pra when you can't love and need to take that one step further that's when you learn what what you're really made of so that's going to be the the last session of the class and so I think it will capture Emerson's teaching obviously we can't do everything in four sessions but it really gets to the heart of what he was trying to communicate what a beautiful course I'm telling you I'm so excited about this and and and having you as a teacher and and I can I can feel how much you love this and I know it's going to radiate to the audience and and let me let me say to everybody the course begins on April 16th and 18th and then the following week the 23rd 25th and I hope you will join us because I know it's going to be magnificent thank you Mark thank you
