  "transcript": "Mr chairman I can't help but reflect on what's happened in the last few months in the Senate no one and I mean no one is interested in or takes seriously lectures on border security from Senate Republicans no one in one of the most stunning acts of political cowardice in recent American history a bipartisan border security bill co-authored by a Conservative Republican member of this committee was put forward in the US Senate it would have tightened Asylum standards to stop exploitation of the Asylum system it would have surged enforcement resources to the Border it would have meant more expedited removals of those who enter this country country unlawfully it would have empowered the federal government to take the fight to the drug cartels who are laying waste to communities across our country with fentel a bipartisan border security bill co-authored by a Conservative Republican member of this committee and it wasn't just voted down by Senate Republicans it was denied even a debate on the floor of the United States Senate because the former president of the United States and he said this publicly thought it wasn't in his political interest for vation to be served it wasn't in his political interest for a bipartisan border security Bill to be enacted by Congress the American people are smart so all of the performative chest pounding today on border security is utterly dis ingenuous when Senate Republicans abrogated their basic governing responsibility and refused even to let us debate and amend that bipartisan border security proposal yeah I think it's safe to say that Democratic senator John oof is done humoring Republican Grand standing on any and all things border related this issue has yet again come to a head in Congress as they consider multiple different bills that would have the ultimate goal of delivering foreign aid to our allies and yet in a move that puts on full display their disingenuousness on this issue the house Freedom caucus has come out as a group in favor of voting against foreign aid because and I hope you're ready for this it doesn't include border security quote the house Freedom caucus will vote no on rule for the America last foreign war supplemental package with zero border security and urge all House Republicans to do the same to secure the Border we must kill the rule in other words the same party that only months ago killed a bill that Conservative Republican James lford negotiated that literally paired Farid with border security because Trump told them to is now refusing to pass forign Aid because it's not linked with border security after months of talk Senate negotiators finally released a sweeping bipartisan border security deal the proposed bill would raise the standard to Grant Asylum send away those who don't qualify and expedite cases for those who do it would also give the president new authority to effectively shut down the border to migrants when attempted Crossings are high and end the practice of Catch and Release while also providing billions of dollars in funding for Ukraine Israel and Taiwan as well as humanitarian assistance for civilians in Gaza but just hours after the bill was released leading Republicans in the house said nope we don't want it almost immediately house Speaker Mike Johnson along with Steve scal and El stefanic took to social media to throw cold water on any hopes of even debating the bill and earlier today they released a statement putting the final nail in the coffin writing that any consideration of this Senate bill in its current form is a waste of time it's Dead on Arrival in the house we encourage the Senate to reject it here's the deal these Republicans think you are stupid they may claim to hate the Democrats but you haven't seen contempt until you've witnessed how Republican politicians treat their own supporters we would quite literally have a border bill right now the most conservative border bill of of our lifetimes mind you if it wasn't for the exact same people who today are complaining that there's no border security Bill fundamentally unserious people in an unserious party and look at this point it doesn't even matter where you stand on this issue maybe you thought the Border bill was too conservative maybe you thought it didn't go far enough whatever your position I think we can at least all agree that these Republicans aren't looking to actually solve anything they are just looking to run around in circles demanding bills that they will then kill only to then turn around and demand them again only to them kill them again and on and on and on because they exist to traffic and dysfunction and waste in fact their bad faith is so obvious that Democratic lawmaker Rosa deloro also called him out on the Appropriations Committee as well it's about border security I sat in the white house not in a classified meeting where Republican colleagues said that we won't have Ukraine without bipartisan borders secure and then you know what we accomplished bipartisan border security it wasn't and and it was oh you can shake your head all you want but Democrats and Republicans voted for border security and you know what it was Donald Trump who said don't give Biden a win you think about that put that aside this moment is now the United States Senate you can have all the views you want about the United States Senate but hold them for this debate it is now it is about the United States House of Representatives we have the opportunity to do what we do here and that is to govern and what are we doing in governing is it to be a world leader and for months and months we have been diddling around where people are dying in Ukraine don't talk about what weapons we want to give them we're not giving them what they need now and it has been months in the coming and we ought it today immediately we should have picked up that Senate Bill brought it to the floor and voted on it immediately and we would be out of here today in doing it let us not rewrite what is happening the moment is ours and if the House of Representatives Advocate abdicates its responsibility yes the history will write the story and that it it is on us when we had that moment we said no I for one will not say no and so now Maga Republicans will continue continue to screw around as long as they can in their interminable effort to sow dysfunction and to hand Vladimir Putin the gift of delayed Aid to Ukraine all in blind deference to Donald Trump trump wants to hurt Biden and help Putin and so that's what Trump's little sick ofense are going to do to the extent that they can because those people exist not to serve their constituents or this country or even the very ideals of Freedom that they purport to support nope they exist to serve their god king Donald Trump in other words they will sit idly by and let the world burn if it means that the leader of their party a proven con man rapist criminal defendant and soon to be convicted felon gets some fleeting bump in the polls as far as Republicans are concerned quite literally nothing is sacred not even the preservation of democracy itself when compared with their slavish Devotion to one man so good on John ooff and Rosa deloro and the rest of the Democrats for calling Republicans pathetic misuse of American taxpayer dollars out they've spent years whining about government waste who would have guessed that if they really wanted to find the root of it all they would need was a [Music] mirror before you go I need
