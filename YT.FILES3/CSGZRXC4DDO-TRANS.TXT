  "transcript": "uh Humanity webinar that we're doing and so whoops come back um so yeah uh thanks for joining now the agenda is really short I've got you know 10 slides to to share and then we'll do a Q&A um and there is on the on the bottom tray if you're on if you're on the desktop it there's a little button it's a Q&A button beside uh chat and participants so you can jump in there and ask questions but you can also upvote questions so we always have about two to three times more questions than I can get to um in in an hour and so what I need you to do is make sure that you upvote the questions that you want answered because then we'll get kind of the most birds with the with the fewest Stones um okay so with all that being said let's go ahead and Jump On In so I've mentioned in a couple videos and a lot of you have pointed out in chat um you know fourth turning um people have talked about it for a while on the on the comments and then people have talked about it in Discord and I finally started listening to this book and I was I was skeptical at first I was really resistant but um kind of a rule that I have is if if you get if you get recommended something three times you should probably read it um you know three separate people and it's been like a dozen so I'm finally finally reading it and I really appreciate the way that this book is structured now I will say that I'm a little bit still skeptical but it is a good pattern um and as as a pattern Seeker as a systems thinker I recognize a lot of the theory that goes into this and so the high level if you're not familiar with the fourth turning it's a generational theory that basically says that there's kind of four phases um and four archetypes in terms of how people come come up in the world and so the the the generations are hero artist Prophet Nomad and so the hero Generation The Last Hero generation was the greatest Generation or the GI generation so this was the generation that fought and won in World War II followed by the artists which was the silent generation so this was like the younger siblings of the of the people who grew up um in kind of the shadow in the aftermath of World War II followed by the Boomers who were you know in the the post-war boom they were born at that time and came up during the Civil Rights Movement and that sort of thing and then finally uh Gen X and Millennials uh you know came came afterwards so Gen X was kind of the last generation of that cycle and now Millennials are when the cycle is restarting and so one way to think of it is that there's this kind of Newtonian equal and opposite reaction to your childhood and in some cases it's a matter of reacting to the excesses or the problems of your childhood and so one of the ways to think about this is the the greatest Generation the GI generation they um you know they were all about structure and institution and Conformity so the reason that McDonald's is the same everywhere is because food chains were like oh well we're we're we're General infantry and so we're we want the same experience everywhere we go um and so that's like why food chains really took off in the 50s and 60s and then of course the the uh Boomers that grew up under that they've been rebelling against Power structures and trying to deconstruct power structures ever since and there's a lot of nuance uh obviously can't can't unpack an entire book um in one slide uh but the each each of these four archetypes is associated with four phases so there's the crisis phase which was World War II and right now then there's the high which was like the 50s and the post-war boom and the next one will be starting in the next five years or so and then followed by an Awakening so that was the Civil Rights Movement the women's rights movement The Swinging 60s and Then followed by an unraveling which is you know reaganism neoliberalism basically the cyberpunk era of the 1980s until about the 2008 recession was kind of the uh the the opening shot of the crisis era so that's the fourth turning and the reason that I'm bringing this up it follows very very closely with u the the book that I read just before this which was Ray Doo's uh navigating or principles of navigating a debt crisis now Ray doio is a sharp guy he's very wealthy but oh my God he needed to hire an editor he wrote The Thing himself and he spends so much time declaiming and saying I'm not an expert in this but this is what I think he said he repeats that phrase like I I kid you not like 500 times in the book and I'm like dude hire an editor anyways but he did his homework he hired apparently he spent like a hundred million researching the to get the data for this book or something I don't know if that's true I heard it on a podcast um but anyways so you look at the timing of this so the last major debt Spike was in the 30s as as FDR just after FDR became president and he was trying to stem the bleeding of the Great Depression and so you see this downward slide as as the debt cycle is coming to an end you've got deleveraging and then you got World War II we have a little bit more debt again and then you have this long gradual UPS slope so you have Reaganomics here in the 80s where you see the debt just kind of really spiking and then it kind of keeps growing up until 2008 which was the last crisis and then we've been deleveraging since so if you look at this timing we are about here is we're about in 1940 in terms of in if this debt cycle continues which means we're right on time for another crisis now that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be a World War but it's looking like it could be and I'll talk about that in just a second so this is just one bit of data that Ray doio puts out oh and by the way this PDF is available for free on on the internet I can post links to that uh Ray doio like his his entire mission is he wants to share all this information as far and wide as possible because he wants to stop this cycle or at least make it not as bad so this is another way of looking at this debt cycle and it's a little bit confusing but it's about total jet total debt as a percentage of GDP and debt servicing as a percentage of GDP and so there's like you know yield curves and all those sorts of things but he breaks it into these Cycles so you got the bubble you've got the top then you've got a depression and then the the beautiful deleveraging which I don't know why he calls it beautiful deleveraging in this he didn't call it that in in the book that I read um it's really kind of a painful deleveraging and so the the top you know this is like when yepy culture was at the peak in the 80s and 90s and so then ever since the Revolution and crash and the 2008 recession that was about here so we're just after that and we're getting to a a Breaking Point and so this is why you constantly see um you know the Senators arguing over like raising the debt ceiling and it's like well what are we going to do basically they're playing a game of economic chicken as best as I can tell all the politicians know what's coming they know that they're just kicking the can down the road and eventually there's going to be something that just forces us to adopt an entirely New Economic Paradigm and I think what they're hoping is that artificial intelligence and other technologies will help us just inflate out of the that pattern so I know this is all very technical um but it's just you know pay attention to the graphs um and if you don't like I barely get it so I could be I could be explaining it incorrectly but so here's here's kind of the best way that I've found of looking at it so if you overlay if you overlay the fourth turning with Ray Doo's debt cycle you say Okay crisis era so you know we had we had the the you know um the stock market crash the Great Depression and that was literally like over a decade of it I think it was about 12 years 12 to 14 years depending on excuse me how you measure it and um so then that was a crisis era so there's an economic crisis followed by you know and this was this the World War I to World War II that was Global crisis and it was worse than other and so then you have this this huge shakeup where nobody is happy so no one's happy in Europe nobody's happy in America um nobody's happy in the uh in the Pacific East and so you have this huge Paradigm shattering set of wars and then you have Breton woods and you have the United Nations and you have NATO and so because everything that has that was broken and shook loose a whole bunch of new institutions were created so that's when you get the the growth of the 50s and 60s and 70s and everyone's just like man we've got 30 years straight of good times and then over over time though you see those oscillations get worse and worse and so then you have you know the peak with the Reaganomics and the so oh another thing to point out the 60s and 70s this is the Awakening era so that's when you have like civil rights movement and and women's movement in The Swinging 60s so this is the most like uh like most religious and sexually and racially permissive uh period of time time and then you have this deleveraging or not deleveraging the unraveling starting so this is why you know this is when the the Gen X was coming coming of age so they came of age as things already kind of started downward and then us Millennials so my first job started right here and then I immediately lost my job after six months um and I was actually homeless for about a month um until my brother had me move in with me so that was the beginning of my career as a millennial so like all the other Millennials we are very very cynical about the establishment and all the assumptions that our our elders all the Gen X and Boomers um that are in policy and politics are telling us because it's like you guys clearly don't know what's going on and so the the echo repeats so we're in a crisis era and you see it just started to take back off again but it it it's not smooth it fits and starts right and so this is kind of like all right well what happens next what's coming and I've got slide about that uh but first we want to fully unpack what is the current crisis that we're facing as a human species across the entire world so first is geopolitical unraveling there's the Middle East so that's the Israel Hamas Iran Arabia and other North Africa so like the houthis um and all that so that entire block of the world is in bad shape and it's seems like it could get worse um especially because there's a lot of people pouring fuel on the fire namely Iran um and America to be honest like we're not we're not really helping there has been some news lately where both Iran and America have signaled that they really don't want to have an active War but we keep trading you know shots across the bow with drones um so with any luck that will stay as a low intensity kind of tit fortat thing but it's entirely possible that it's going to escalate um outside of our control namely because of uh you know all all of basically there's so many pieces on the board all in that one area then you have EUR Asia so you have Russia Ukraine Europe and NATO I don't know if you guys have seen But Poland and others and Germany are all like bracing for a Russian invasion and I'm like I don't see it but again you know I'm I'm listening to uh well-connected people in the defense industry um in the Intel industry and you know you look at the spending a lot of people in NATO are jacking up their their military spending so I don't see that Russia has the power to do Invasion I mean not not a serious Invasion but they could cause some cause some pain uh but this you you see like all the people joining NATO like Sweden joining NATO and those sorts of things so you're you're really kind of rallying around um and kind of bracing for whatever's coming now even if Europe or even if Russia um is not necessarily a serious threat to all of Europe that doesn't mean that it can't cause some some real severe pain and heartache because they also are nuclear armed and Putin is who knows what Putin's real motivations are um so that's that's that quarter of the world but then you also have Asia Pacific which is primarily the tension between America and China but then you also throw in Japan Australia Korea um North Korea and there's a lot of tension in that region as well and uh now of course this looks very similar to World War I and World War II you have basically the same axes now what about the global South South America and Africa not really going to be major Battlegrounds I don't think North Africa possibly um but again it's it's these are the three three main axes and also you have to remember that most of the human population is in the northern hemisphere um now with that being said I I did see that Guyana is about to be invaded by what is it Venezuela I don't remember um but there is there is some uh some tension happening um in South America now domestically within America we're looking at a financial uh crisis so that's the debt cycle that I was just talking about followed by by deleveraging we're entering spiritual crises so it's relatively Bleak right now um some people are rallying around so you see this in particularly in politics where a lot of uh Hardline you know Christian nationalists are really doubling down they're going as hard as they can because they think that enforcing you know their their particular their one world view with politics is going to save us spiritually that's not how it's going to play out um but but again the the the and I'll talk about the tightening of the status game in just a second but then also technology ology technology is fundamentally going to reshape our social and economic landscape in the same way that the first second and third Industrial Revolution intrinsically reshaped everything um now I've talked extensively about postmodernism and nihilism so I probably don't need to to rehash that is that's not new information this other stuff is new information um but what I will say is that the the Confluence of environmental nihilism political nihilism and then economic nihilism um that is that's a pretty toxic mixture um and that's part of what what our generation and younger Millennials and gen Z are fed up with and eventually enough is enough and so that's kind of what's coming is is this kind of enough is enough um and you know I don't know how bad it's going to get but I think that the next five years we'll see um so speaking of the next five years uh everything based on based on the both the fourth turning and Ray Do's long-term debt cycle it looks like it's all going to come to a before uh before not 1930 before 2030 um uh the the fourth turning he predicts 2026 at least in the original book I just saw that there's a you know the fourth turning is here book I haven't read that one yet um so 2026 that seems just as good as any plus AI is going to be um reaching a fever pitch then um whatever happens is probably going to happen this year next year or the following year um and then of course if it is a war if it is a World War those usually take three to five years to to wear out and so you know we're right on schedule for whatever is going to happen it's going to it's going to be done by 2030 I I suspect and then we're going to kind of go into that new high it's going to be an a a repeat of the post-war Boom the Nifty 50s you know so on and so forth but in the meantime status games will tighten and so what I mean by that is you're going to get more and more misinformation disinformation we're going to have informant culture the same way that Nazi Germany had informant culture of you know tattling on their parents for not being loyal to the party you already see this with Donald Trump B basically doubling down and focusing on loyalty above all else um you're going to see this as you know informing based on using Tik Tok and that sort of thing I think that it's going to look a little bit different um because with the internet there's so much more transparency and I think that I think that the that the culture war is more going to be waged on digital Battlegrounds with misinformation campaigns and those sorts of things um there are there are some things that are obviously like troll Farm bots on my YouTube comments that I see some of them are more sophisticated who knows um it could also be it could also be false positives um but you know nationalism and then US versus them thinking is also going to increase again this is I'm not I'm not saying I endorse this this is just the pattern um this is just how things kind of tend to to go out the biggest risk of war is the US versus China now it's entirely possible that this plays out exactly how us vers versus Soviet Union played out for you know several decades where it was a lot of low intensity proxy wars um and especially over the last few months as I saw uh us and China um both doing war games and then the rhetoric cooled off drastically after they both did war games I think that they both realized that a hot War basically nobody wins a hot war between America and China and so they're like okay let's you know let's let's calm down and even China um as of this week they're calling for all nuclear armed powers to have a um to adopt a formal policy of no first use for nuclear weapons now I don't know if we can trust China to say that but at least that's what they're saying um it would be nice if if we could but of course you know America does not have a no- first use policy so you know it it would be hypocritical of of us to you know criticize them when they have a publicly and explicitly adopted a no first use policy and we haven't I personally think that a no first use policy um would be good but there's something what was it called it's called strategic uh strategic ambiguity so the name of the game for America right now strategic ambiguity which is why we never fully commit to saying you know we will defend Taiwan to the last man we say we like Taiwan and let them try and figure it out so that strategic amb ambiguity is actually the explicit policy of the state department now I do suspect that this that the major State powers are going to shy away from nuclear and biological warfare particularly with the pandemic which what I I'm pretty sure the the evidence is there that it was a lab leak I don't think it was a bioweapon lab leak I think it was just a a lab leak but people realize that biot terrorism and and biological warfare is completely indiscriminate and nobody wins um so I don't think any sane person would use would use that uh so and that's the kind of thing if it does happen like game's over um if nuclear war does happen game's over but I think um what we're seeing on the battlefield in in Ukraine is that drone and cyber warfare are probably going to be front and center um for the next several decades or at least the the the new paradigm so what comes next if we survive this if we get to 2030 what comes next the two things is new paradigms and new institutions and so if we if we look to history as as um as a way of uh you know kind of predicting the future now again the paradigms are different every every site every time the cycle repeats but we know we can kind of you know create classifications of we know what's going to change or at least we know which sectors are going to change we don't necessarily know how they're going to change so social paradigms are going to change we're already seeing this with you know uh orientations toward gender religion tolerance sexuality that sort of stuff um the in the fourth turning he says that I don't remember exactly but like during some of those different Cycles you see tightening of gender gaps and then widening of gender gaps you see tightening of racial relations and then broadening of of racial Rel ations but you can expect some Trends to change or reverse and I think an example of what this actually looks and feels like is how um how the basically the entire left or liberal of America like went into a death spiral because of the Israel Gaza thing where you have um some liberals like you know just throwing in and saying Gaza is completely right and because it's they're looking for like a victim Victor mentality um they're looking for a bully like an aggressor and a and a victim um and they're trying to think in in very black and white terms and that's just true of young people in general young people tend to think more in black and white terms um so and that's not that's not to criticize that's just okay if someone looks like they're they're the victim maybe you know the bully and on paper on numbers like yeah Israel is definitely the bully especially when you look at last I heard it was like 27,000 civilians killed mostly women and children like yeah that doesn't look good that's that's a bad look as the kids say um we're going to see political changes as well namely the end of gerent gerent tocy um is one of the things because just by virtue by Dent of the fact that boomers are going to be aging out um they're going to be replaced by mostly Millennials um and the reason is because Gen X is a much smaller generation but also because of because they are coming from The Nomad generation they're kind of disinterested they're kind of cynical and disinterested and that's not to say that like if you're a member of Gen X you don't care about politics that's not really what I mean but just numerically speaking they far more Millennials and they're also because they have more Decades of kind of being trapped being stuck in a survival mode they're kind of just like you know like yeah whatever it'll it'll play out I don't really care it's not my thing but us Millennials and US younger people we're fired up like we're we're angry and we want we want to make things change um and so that's that's kind of what I mean there for spirituality it's it's not yet clear how that's going to play out we're definitely seeing more reconstructionism and revivalism um it'll be interesting to see how that plays out you know there's already like Robo theocracy you know kind of um in the in the in the comments where people like want to worship Roo roko basilisk and that sort of thing I don't know if that's going to happen um economic paradigms those are all going to be shattered and I've talked about that quite extensively so I don't need to need to rehash that um but I think you guys get the point um yeah so that is that that's the presentation um let me go ahead and stop sharing and we'll move over to Q&A so also um there's there's only a few questions in the Q&A so make sure everyone is using the Q&A button to to launch their questions and also um upvote their questions that they want to get answered um let me also check the comments to see what people are talking about yeah all right Philippines Taiwan Venezuela let's see but interestingly Chinese are the largest way of the Southern yeah all right cool let me check on the Q&A all right so Daryl's question was the first one and it has one up vote um let's see I'm not familiar with the University of Maryland um so I can't really say anything specific um but darl did you have a specific question here let me let me invite you up to speak Daryl all right darl what's your question hey Dave I just wanted to ask about you know with um the UMD project how much of an impact will impact um about what you're talking about with the humanity and Stu yeah I'm not familiar with the project so can you give me a little bit of background there it's it's a it's a huge project working on on industry and how to regulate AI um in regards to what Biden is proposing um in his AI um policies so it's it's it's pretty much a global effort um from a project management perspective um with the US so it's a US effort right now gotcha yeah so I'm I'm not familiar with the details um but what I can say is that many many universities around the world as well as policy people um inside governments are also working on some of these um some of these Frameworks are you do you know any of the kind of principles or tenants that they're that they're proposing more towards um leaning towards um using Microsoft products with the security features since you know the US government heavily uses Microsoft with uh with with with specific projects and mainly ethics as far as what they want to pretty much cover with how how ethics needs to be incorporated in most businesses or in all businesses right in the world yeah okay so so that those kinds of policies are operating within the container of established frame works and so what I mean by that is is the way that it's described in for instance in the fourth turning is that you have people that are not ready to yet Embrace fundamentally new approaches and paradigms and so because of that talking about the ethics of using an AI tool as if it is just another AI tool fails to fully take into account the fact that it is going to disrupt every assumption that we have about how technology works and and um how like how to even handle it so yeah you can talk about ethics it's it's not a bad conversation to have um but it's still Falls very very very far short of the conversations that need to be happening in government um with respect to Breaking assumptions that we have about you know employment for instance breaking assumptions that we have about corporatism for instance breaking assumptions that we have about capitalism so any conversation that falls short of that is going to um intrinsically come up short in the long run unfortunately you are absolutely 100% correct because even uh talking about ethics in AI or project management it's kind of taboo at this point especially with how AI is Rally growing yep it's really interesting yep yeah no and it it here's the thing is reality will assert itself eventually because you know the understanding the the status quo and you know the establishment always wins and um that is the safest assumption because for most of history and actually R both Ray doio and the authors of the fourth turning talk about this um in when when they talk about like the assumptions because most people only see one major paradigm shift in their entire life and then they kind of assume that the world will always be like that forever and ever afterwards also Jonathan I see that you raised your hand um but I got you got to um add in a question under the QA tab and then uh and you can also Advocate if you want to get your your question upvoted um but yeah I didn't want you to just sit there with your hand hand raised um yeah and so it's not it's not really any um anyone's fault because it's like you know you only live through one World War II in your life time now granted some people saw both World War I and World War II um but then it's been it's been 80 years since the end of World War II nobody really alive today has seen the whole the whole thing the whole picture um the whole cycle and only the oldest people have seen the cycle but you know the oldest people that are in office are Joe Biden and Donald Trump and Nancy Pelosi and those sorts of people and they're a little bit out of touch like all of them I'm not really a fan of any of them um but again they also have decades and Decades of kind of this this status quo that they're familiar with so good question Daryl all right let's get see who's next whoops there we go all right let's see who's next do a refresh all right will I see you got a you got you got some up votes and Eric I see that you raised your hand make sure you do uh you use the QA tab oh I see you have a question asked um but you'll need to get you'll need to get some upvotes if you want to talk with people in the chat all right let's see who's next will is next all right will come on up what got how you doing good how you been good excellent I uh what are some potential spiritual ramifications both beneficial and detrimental that you envision in the realm of radical life extension oo that's a good one yeah so you know I I haven't asked this question publicly yet um and it's partly because usually I come up with a better question question or I haven't fully formed this question yet but you know some people and it's a pretty common refrain which is that death is What Gives Life Meaning and I don't really believe in that that just sounds like pure cope to me um you know it's like death is a fact of life yes um but I don't know that death is what confers meaning to life the fact that there is a definite book end to life um but with that in mind if you no longer have the expect that you'll die one day you know except by accident like every everyone on a long enough timeline everyone will die right even if you become functionally immortal the universe will probably end at some point um and so even if you live you know 11 quintilian Google years or whatever it's going to be finite but chances are statistically speaking like you're going to get caught in a supernova before that happens excuse me still a little congested from that sinus infection I had um so what happens in the in the short term is and I actually talked about this on a few podcasts uh last year is when you have radical life extension for the first few decades nobody's really going to notice and the reason nobody's really going to notice is because our time Horizon basically like our ability to think about our future and Our Fate only extends about a year or two into the future beyond that it's like hey I know that I'm not in any mortal Peril right now so I'm probably going to be fine most people don't really live that far in the future and even people with stuff like health anxiety um like Brian Johnson that millionaire who spends like you know $2 million a year um he's reacting to another kind of anxiety another kind of it's more of a body it's an embodied kind of anxiety he's not actually worried about dying next year what he's responding to is a very immediate form of anxiety which is like what's wrong with my body what's going on right now um but in the long term once you know grandchildren grow up and you know Grandma and Grandpa and Mom and Dad all look the same age and I look at the same age that's when we're really going to see some social and spiritual changes and it's really going to start Dawning on people oh yeah like this is something new and like one of the comments that came up was like you know if people are living you know if if we H hit indefinite lifespan is it going to be like people that are 120 years old dating someone who's 40 years old and you can't tell the difference in anyways cuz they're all functionally 25 um that's going to be something that happens and and I do suspect on a social level there will still be differences because like the amount of life experience that you have at 125 still very different than how much you have it at you know 45 years old um but with those longer lifespans one of the worst things that I'm that I'm afraid of is is one accumulation of power um because the longer you live the more connections you have the more wealth you have the more power you can consolidate that is that's more of a social thing but on a on a spiritual or philosophical level is like do people stagnate do they calcify and what I mean by calcify is like do you get just kind of stuck in your ways and then you live for you know decades and decades or centuries and Centuries with the same beliefs um and that that could be bad that could be destructive to society in terms of in terms of like does that mean more people will be Christian or less people will be Christian you know I I don't really know like I I do not have any framework to make that prediction other than like I can I can anticipate some of the risks now if more people start doing psychedelics I think that we're going to have a very very different kind of of religion and spirituality in the coming decades um and I'm I'm kind of of the school of thought that that original Christian mysticism is entirely rooted in psychedelics um you know you the the evidence is there both the anthropological and archaeological evidence is there that early Christianity early Islam and all the all the Proto religions were all primarily shamanic psychedelic based religions and we're going through a psychedelic Renaissance and I think if I I I don't know what where it's going to turn out but I do think the Psychedelic Renaissance is going to be the biggest primary like influence so that's kind of that's kind of my my shtick what do you think about all that yeah no I I wholeheartedly agree um I'm a big fan of uh John Marco Allegro um his book yeah I'm sure you know of it if you know about Christian mysticism especially to do with psychedelic culture I haven't I I don't recognize the name but uh what was the name of his book I'm Pro I probably know what you're referring to by a different different name um let me hold on let me I H I have it um let me look real quick if you don't have it yeah you can just drop yeah yeah John Michael like I'll I'll I'll drop it in the chat yeah cool but um yeah it had to do with um so diing mushrooms and around um the Jesus story basically around that yep um and I think it had to do with the I believe it had to do with the Dead Sea Scrolls as well yeah thetic gospels I I think it I think it probably goes back even older than that if you look at the um like the elosan Mysteries I mean it goes back to the Golden Age of Athens if not older um that there's a lot of influences even before you know Jesus of nazare Nazareth and stuff and and Old Testament you know like a original judaic my mysticism that goes back five six thousand years like that I'm there's I think they were out in the desert tripping balls um I think there's a lot of evidence for that um intentionally or otherwise so yeah good Stu Burning Bush was uh an acacia tray yeah yeah yeah where DMT is derived from right um yeah that sounds about right I don't know I don't know the specifics off the top of my head but yeah yeah I believe it is thank you all right yeah thank you great question all right let's see who's next hit refresh all right Matt Nelson you got a question let me bring you on up Matt all right Matt what's your question hey thanks can you hear me okay yep loud and clear all right so this was just a response to when you were talking about the book and you were talking about all the all the research that went into it all the data that the author sort of put together and laid out um it is pretty clear to see these patterns um but my I guess what I was thinking though is that um I have a hard time relying on the past data to like Divine where the patterns are leading um just given the state of AI right now and the fact you know it's going to disrupt everything like we said and it's like so many different changes at once is it just seems like so unpredictable um that I feel like none of these past indicators even though they're well researched um seem that relevant you know what I mean oh yeah no and so that's that's where I was and I'm and I don't disagree because you know when we talk about breaking paradigms and and coming up with fundamentally new you know modes of reality yes it's entirely possible that every past assumption is going to be wrong uh particularly you know when we look at can machine replace human labor eminently it seems possible okay well humans have been responsible for most labor for most of existence so we don't have a model for that so you're absolutely right um now at the same time in in in these books they talk about how people in the past have also assumed that something is going to change forever or that we're at the end times and that and that yes there is chaos and that that your way of life is fundamentally dying out you know that goes back to that vesence term that you know Nostalgia for for right now where we recognize that we're the last of an era right that like that's that that everything is going to change and so change I think is probably the only thing that we can all agree on um but and and by virtue of that change then everything that we know today and familiar and are familiar with today is dying out it's kind of like you know the person you are today is not the person you are tomorrow um but yeah you're right like there's only so much that we can Divine from from these patterns I did find it very helpful to understand that like okay technology is the only thing that's really kind of fundamentally changing human biology and human evolution that's relatively fixed particularly in this time scale and so that's when when I read Ray Doo's thing and said okay you know this these are aggregate behaviors based on economics and then I read the fourth turning which is an intergenerational uh pattern and said okay we can probably rely on the human factor because you know humans are flawed and messy um but we're and we're also predictable so the the wild card here is the technology though does that make sense yeah it does um it also made me think about how you were talking about the stagnation problem with longevity it feels like it's kind of on us like as a society to make stagnation into a like like a social fuxa basically right like whether it's legal or not you know it should be socially illegal just like you know drinking and driving that sort of thing right because everybody who Embraces stagnation and says well I just am who I am you know I'm not going to change I'm done you know progressing right I'm old now like that is toxic to everybody right it's an everybody's best interest to sort of socially pressure that person away from that that ideology I agree somewhat but so there's there's one major Silver Lining with people living a longer and that is having a longer cultural memory and so in some respects like let's say let's say so here's here's kind of the thought experiment that I did which is all right so let's let's assume that the fourth turning is correct and that there's four primary intergenerational archetypes there's probably more I mean he he he unpacks that there's other models some that say that there's you know three or five or eight or whatever but the idea is that there's a finite number of like intergenerational archetypes now instead of them aging out uh imagine that they all stay and so imagine that we have the heroes the prophets the artists and the nomads all living side by side yes there's going to be some fragmentation because a lot of people get kind of stuck in their ways and their beliefs and they're like ah you know like for instance my my ex-wife's uh grandmother was in in Russia during the famines and she watched her little brother starve to death and that shaped her forever she's never going to forget that I mean she the grandmother has since died but imagine that she was still alive and young today you know an active voter and still part of the family and was going to be alive for the next several centuries she will always remember like Soviet communism and famines and Central management are bad and she'll have that lived experience and that living memory of how things could go horribly wrong and so while while that stagnation could be problematic it could be difficult especially if we get if we get stagnation around really important social values like racism and sexism and you know everything you know those those kinds of things all the isms um but at the same time that living memory I think is going to do Society um more good than harm um now could it be that the that the same medicines and the same procedures that give us Rejuvenation also make our brains more flexible I think so because you know like part part of the way that you measure neurological age is lack of cognitive flexibility well if you reverse that then like if everyone is as mentally flexible as they were when they were 25 like I don't it might not be a problem it could be a moot point so I agree I I thinking that too that you know sort of being younger gives us the younger brains and sort of makes us more you know like prone to doing that so that does give me hope to yep yeah and and and as someone mentioned in the comments it it should be up to choice right you know individual liberty personal freedom um if someone wants to be stuck in their ways great um but and as you said in some cases if you have like to today for instance you know if you have really overtly sexist or racist views you're going to kind of get cast out of mainstream Society like you you'll have your own little Echo chamber but like you won't be welcome in a lot of places um if you if you maintain those problematic beliefs but you're welcome to you know everyone is welcome to their beliefs it's just there's also going to be consequences so yeah good good stuff any any final points uh no that's it I feel like I've taken enough of your time thank you yeah great question thank you all right let's see who's next and uh folks remember you can um you can jump in on uh on the the Q&A and and add questions I see someone uh someone Anonymous um asked a question if you if this was you um you can talk but I'm not going to make anyone talk who doesn't want to um so jump in the chat if you want to talk you can you should be able to unicast me directly um but I'll go ahead and answer this since nobody is volunteering all right so the question from Anonymous is with the creation of ASI from tech companies won't they become the most powerful being on Earth then isn't isn't that an issue so I'll say sort of and the reason that I say sort of is because this kind of requires us to make some assumptions about what ASI is and what it does and how it works and so ASI artificial super intelligence it's probably not going to be a single atomized entity it's not going to be one robot or one data center it's going to be a collection of models it's going to be a collection of data centers it's going to be a collection of Hardware so it's intrinsically decentralized it's intrin physically distributed now you might say okay well yeah but Microsoft and Google and you know apple and all them they're going to control it sort of like yes they might have they might have some control over the foundational training of the models and that sort of thing but there's also going they're not just going to be running it for themselves they're going to be selling those Services those services are going to be powering a lot of other services and products and so you have this really like broad Market and and also it's not going to just be one model it's going to be at first you know we have we already have hundreds of models thousands of models it before too long we're going to have millions and billions of different models of different agents of different strengths and weaknesses and costs and benefits and those sorts of thing and so this is why I've been talking about the Digital superorganism model of kind of understanding what is it that we're creating and you know it's not it when you see in fiction like the one Skynet um that's one that's not likely from just a development standpoint creating one single self-contained entity that is that big and that powerful is just impractical the reason that it's done though is for a narrative purposes it's easier to have one nebulous you know Skynet um but that's probably not going to be how it emerges instead it's going to be hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of companies some with open source some with closed Source you're going to have data centers you're going to have smaller versions that can run on your phone you can have nodes at your at your home office or whatever and and every business is going to have their own every country is going to have their own there's going to be some International models and so when you when you realize it we're actually going into this really big Divergence in terms of how AI is going to be created implemented and trained really looking at at it in terms of Aggregates and in terms of incentive structures that's really to me a better way of looking at it um so I hope that helps helps it make sense in terms of how it's going to be and this is why I really in the particularly in my video this morning I mentioned that I'm really glad that at least Mark Zuckerberg is in favor of Open Source models um I hope that more are but of course there are some companies like anthropic and mistol and and others that are just intrinsically open source now some of them are going to go one way or the other and even Sam Altman has been asked directly at a few interviews like hey are you going to open source your your older models and he's like we might do it at some point it's like well hopefully um but either way you know Uther Ai and conjecture and all these other ones um that are kind of more intrinsically open source I suspect that we're going to always have a balance of Open Source and closed Source but it's also like you know compute Hardware is going to be everywhere and these models are going to be everywhere and so it's it's not going to be just one monolith it's it it was never going to be one monolithic um entity it's always it was always going to be decentralized and distributed um but that means that there's it's an entire new set of complexity Theory and Game Theory in order to understand how do you shape this how do you shape the incentives um so that it evolves in a way that is beneficent for Humanity and that's that's kind of the central part of my work so that's a that's a good question I hope I I hope I answered it um yeah so cool let's see who's next all right Gustavo what should children learn today let me ask bring you up oh did he might have left I don't see someone with the same name who's still in oops come back QA yeah it looks like it looks like the guy who asked this question left um so the the question is what should children learn that are born today and so my I've I've solidified around this answer and it's it's probably a little bit disappointing to some people um but it's people skills uh relationship skills people skills communication negotiation those are Far and Away going to be the most important skills they're already the most valuable skills for all all people um because every so when I started investing you can see some of the some of the like communication and relationship books right over my head um when I started investing in people skills my career took a very different turn um that's how you get into like upper management that's how you get into leadership that's how you get investors um that's but but also every time I learned something for a relationship with my now wife it applied directly to uh work and so then it's like okay well if you imagine we're heading towards a post- labor future or or a meaning economy or or you know a status economy how do you how do you generate meaning and so my model for for the meaning economy is REM relationships experiences and Mission and so relationships Far and Away give you the most amount of meaning in your life and this is true for for people across all time all Humanity um and only once I once I was thinking about that I was like all the all the people who are strong nihilists that I know they're all very lonely people um and that's that's not to say oh well if you're lonely you're a nihilist or if you're a misfit you're anilist but I'm just saying like if you don't have if you don't get meaning from relationships because of you know whatever reason because of the generation you're part of or because of isolation or whatever then yeah nihilism seems more appropriate to you but for people with lots of healthy relationships they just nihilism doesn't make any sense and biologically neurologically speaking you get most of your meaning from relationships you also get meaning from unique novel experiences and finally you get meaning from uh from having Mission or purpose in your life and that can be any number of things it can be everything from you want to clean up a river that you love it could be being a good parent it could be what my mission is which is why I'm here today um but yeah so so the underpinning for all of that is communication skills and people skills and I will add systems thinking systems thinking is incredibly valuable for any of those whether you want to systematically approach um you know creating new relationships or meetup groups or Co cohabitation whatever um if you want to you know uh pursue any Mission uh systems thinking is good for for any kind of any kind of big mission the bigger the mission the more systems thinking you need and that sort of thing so good question I hope I hope that you whoever asked that I I hope either you're on here or you get to hear it on the recording got to catch my breath all right Anonymous asks again this is what was upvoted with impending economic shifts on the horizon what pivotal changes and niches in AI should we watch and what strategies uh can startups employ to thrive so I don't know if I have quite enough context for this I'm going to have to make some assumptions as to what you meant um but let's see let me unpack this so e economic shifts on the horizon yes I agree with that pivotal changes and niches in AI should we watch so the first thing is going to be the impact of Robotics so we're you know agents are on the rise right now we can kind of anticipate what agents are going to do the rule of thumb is if you can do it on a computer an agent's going to be able to do it in many cases the agents are already good at doing a lot of things that you can do on a computer um robots is kind of the big wild card because some people are predicting like oh well there's going to be limitations of the hardware or you know a robot that is as dextrous as a human is just going to be too expensive or maybe maybe the fine motor dexterity means that robots are never going to be able to do uh electricians work or plumbers work or that sort of thing I don't know that I believe that because when you consider that most the pr the most precise Machining that is done is already done by robots so machines can do Super Hyper precise Machining and Super Hyper precise tasks then you just attach that to a humanoid robotic chassis I don't see what the problem is um so that's that's that and then if you're a startup the the startups that I see that are doing the best it's it's the combination of AI expertise and subject matter expertise and so what I mean by that is an example is um one of the best examples is case law so case law um or case text case text case text is the name of the startup and so that was a bunch of lawyers who understood um you know what goes into uh researching case law and then they just pointed all the you know Rag and and and large language models at it and now my lawyer friends that that use that it's like oh well we don't need to hire paral leals we just use the service for $20 a month or how it's probably more than that because it's for law um but when you when you when you combine that deep subject matter expertise with AI expertise those are the startups that are doing best right now now again if you don't have the right business model or the right then like you could get nuked from orbit just like we've seen with a lot of the creative ones um that it's just like oh hey like you know chat GPT the new version completely killed everything that you were working on and that's still possible although that kind of trend has slowed down so that's a good question I hope that answers your question um with respect to uh the the coming changes all right let's see who's next Luke looks like you're up actually no Eric I know you asked this question a while ago so we'll we'll get Eric up excuse me I got hiccup I had a had a fast lunch with my friend earlier all right Eric let's get you up all right Eric what you got you're muted there you go um still can't hear you you might have a hardware level mute mute on your your microphone did we skip Matt um all right Eric we'll bring you back up take a take take some time to figure out your your microphone okay let's see who's next George uh Matt was up a little while ago um all right who's next we got Luke will get lukee up oh you're fine George you can catch it in the recording if uh if you missed it all right Luke what's your question hey Dave uh I'm just wondering I mean I know this obviously there's so many variables on how this could you know turn out but like say say there was a war in the future I mean you know the the first thing I'm thinking is like especially with AI and and Robotics and stuff I'm assuming that countries are going to be less likely to actually put go humans on the ground um I mean even nowadays I mean I'm sure that's I don't know the statistics but I'm sure that's pretty slim but you know I'm wondering like what do you think that would look like you know do you think it would be like say us and China like what do you think the likelihood would be that would actually be direct fighting between us and China or more of like multiple smaller proxy wars yeah so proxy wars are are kind of the thing that you see and so for with us and China what I think what we're I think the flasho is going to be the South China Sea um because it's like you know there's Vietnam and the Philippines and Japan kind of all like vying for control over that and there are there are uh geological reasons like um geography is Destiny um with respect to geopolitics and War and China is hemmed in by the by the first and second island chains as well as by India and as well as by Siberia now if Russia collapses then I wouldn't be surprised if China just annexes most of of that side of Russia honestly um and it would make sense for them to do that if they could do it without triggering a major war but Russia can't defend its borders um and that's a lot of land um that would help China get access to more natural resources and more deep waterer ports uh in the long run now that is that is like it's not a guarantee that Russia is going to disintegrate further there's a lot of people predicting it there's a lot of people saying that's nonsense it could go either way I think is kind of the the takeaway um whenever whenever there's that much disagreement it means that there's no certainty likewise even if that did happen it's anyone's guess as to whether or not China would take advantage of that now in the in the medium term you have China with the Belton Road initiative which is trying to get more geopolitical power across the Middle East and Africa and also South America that's not part of the Belton Road initiative but China is doing their their debt trap diplomacy in South America as well and when you look at the pattern the reason that China is going for all those places is because they're more vulnerable because there's less economic power to be had there and so then the way that I've come to understand it is China is feeling around they're hemmed in on a lot of sides and so they're making alliances with with countries that are not economic powerhouses and never well I'm not going to say never will be but won't be in the foreseeable future and then they're they're they're taking these physical approaches like the belt and Road initiative because they can't project enough power to control the South China Sea totally or you know get past Japan and that sort of thing and so it's like if you think of it as like kind of an amoeba sending out feelers in every direction they're just sending out fielders in every direction and grabbing whatever power they can and so I suspect that we're going to see very very similar kind of proxy wars to the same that we saw like you know the first Vietnam War um the same in Afghanistan repeatedly um that sort of thing um and in fact I was just rewatching Ghost in the Shell with my wife and they said that you know there was the second Vietnam War and World War 4 and so the Japanese have been predicting this for a long time I'm not saying that like Vietnam is going to be I'm not I'm not saying that like oh the you know World War I is going to take place in Vietnam I'm just pointing out that that is that that kind of proxy war because the first Vietnam War was a proxy war by the way um that that kind of thing is probably going to be uh the you know the kind of the deao the status quo for the foreseeable future um now in terms of how that battle looks in terms of in terms of How It's fought like we're we're already seeing that that Ukraine is having great success using drones against even you know fleets um like the the Russia's Black Sea Fleet is basically decimated by by drone boats um and then Russia's tank uh battalions are invalidated by drones um and and the range of drones is also going up crazy high like hundreds of miles um so you know small fast discret quiet um that's that's the name of the game uh now is that really going to change the broader geopolitical L like no power power remains relatively static um and what I mean by that is is kind of what I said which is uh geography is Destiny you know it's like if you've got the arable land if you've got the if you've got the deep water ports if you've got the forest land um those sorts of things that that still seems like the primary determinant of culture and the outcomes of War um I don't I don't remember who it was but someone said uh I I don't care I don't care about you know soldiers and tanks and mines tell me tell me the banks Whoever has the most Financial power wins the war and that was someone talking about I think World War I or World War II um so you know when you when you look at the fundamentals China just doesn't hold a candle to America alone let alone all of our allies you know China uh sorry Japan Australia Europe um India and India I know like India has to be very careful because of where they are uh uh geographically speaking so they often will kind of equivocate they won't explicitly come out against Russia and China um but yeah so that's that's uh that's kind of my take what are your what are your thoughts on all that yeah no it make it makes total sense I mean the the one thing I'm thinking now when you were talking about you drones I'm wondering on the good side of things I wonder if the advancements in technology would actually make well I know cleaner is not the right word but like eliminate some um like civilian deaths like I wonder like as the military technology gets more advanced maybe we're more likely to see like specific smaller military installations taken out instead of like oh you know just wipe out this whole entire area yeah so well there there's a few things with respect to population all nations are falling way short of their of their recruiting quotas because uh because young people today are um either too too out of shape addicted to drugs or too anxious and depressed and so the number of people that are physically and mentally fit for service is is dwindling drastically and this is not just America or China this is everywhere um and so they're looking at Shoring up um that deficit with automation with robotics with drones and it's by virtue of the fact that they have to um and and eventually because of that demographic uh decline we're going to see the same thing in Industry um as some people in the comments today pointed out uh there's already Talent gaps um all over the world all over all over the industry um which is making it harder for a lot of companies to hire and then you say okay well the the the demographic dividend is ending for places like China it's actively ending right now it already ended a while ago for Japan and Italy and that sort of thing um and so it's like oh hey your economy collapses if you don't have enough young people uh and so there's two ways out of that one is AI Automation and Robotics and two longevity and we need both of those um now now if if if suddenly you give someone a magic pill and it's like oh hey you're going to be 25 for the rest of your life they're less likely to want to go start shooting at someone they're like why don't we figure figure out how to get along instead um so yeah good good point all around thanks Dave all right good questions all right uh let's see Eric let's see if you got your uh microphone sorted out get me just a second all right all right Eric come on up am I loud and clear there we go gotcha awesome all right hi Dave um so uh I've been wanting to uh bring this up here I want to talk about um specifically brain augmentation like people's interest in brain augmentation people wanting to live in VR uh virtual reality you know and Gene editing and I I help I can't help but feel like this is all um uh kind of um so sorry I was getting distracted um I can't help but feel like these are all advocating for new vastly different Perceptions in reality and and I feel like this this will in the future will ensue like uh very R radically different uh perceptions and advocating for different uh sorry um no worries what you got sorry kind of stage fright um oh yeah well okay so let me let me see if I understand so your your question is about um kind of the long-term impacts of things like you know full dive VR and and genetic manipulation and and kind of like what does it mean to be human is that kind of what you're getting at um yes but um basically I want uh the question I want to ask is how do you see like Harmony coming um with between all these different walks of life in the long term um the one of the one of the simplest things and we already know this is tolerance is we're we're in a we're in a paradigm right now where people want to control each other and we see this in America both on the right and the left where um the left wants to police speech and and you know ban ban certain ideas and and censor certain things and the right wants to ban and C sensor entirely different things for different reasons but it's the same behavior and so you know some of some of the religious right are saying like oh we want to make um homosexuality go away we want to make casual sex go away they want to enforce their their generally you know Christian worldview on everyone else and then likewise you know the the the the farle want to kind of inflict the same thing police other people's speech um and that sort of stuff and we already know the principle which is just tolerance which is just Live and Let Live um and by by a by by holding some of those ideals as as higher principles is is um is is individual liberty uh equality before the law and the rest of it you just let it sort itself out you let people be how they are and one thing that I think might happen is what I hope happens is as we get towards more post- labor economics obviously some people will always spend time on the internet but I'm just thinking like man if if all of my friends were were and and if we were all retired I would spend very very little time on the internet like I would watch the occasional uh you know YouTube video I would play some games with my friends but mostly I would be like you know hanging out with my niece um I'd be hanging out with my wife I'd be TR traveling and I'd be I'd be more anchored in in real life um and I think that that's going to be a big thing is is people are going to realize the world is big and complicated um and especially as we have ai agents that can interact with the internet on our behalf we just like you know what just tell me just tell me what's relevant just tell me what I care about and and to hell with the rest um now obviously some people will not make that choice but some people will um but and I think that if we just if we valorize if we say you know what tolerance equality before the law Live and Let Live if we just say those are the chief principles and we trust that everything else is going to work out I think that I think that people will realize the stakes are not as high as they need to be and to stop making things worse good question yeah no uh I agree um I think and like you said as like communication becomes more relevant and becomes key to you know humans existence um yeah I I feel like some a lot of people I've noticed um are already on that boat you know yep so yeah no yeah it's communication people skills uh systems thinking and then I guess maybe maybe Civics and and you know principles or and ethics or whatever um yeah good question thanks man thank you all right let's get back over to the Q&A see who's up all right so whoever this Anonymous person is that's asking questions you're getting all the upvotes so you're asking good questions um all right so Anonymous asks uh what actions should individuals take now to maximize personal benefits from Ai and Ascend socially thereby tapping into the new generational wealth created by AI advancements so I will differentiate so my my my immediate offthe cuff thing is there's a difference between generational wealth and social ascent and so what I'm doing being here and with with with everyone and and on YouTube that is that is part of the social ascent and so that is that is um playing a new status game now in terms of wealth I am not like I I I am behind in terms of where I should be in terms of wealth um I I'm doing better than many people but I'm certainly not in like a top bracket um and if you want to maximize and capture wealth like I do have friends that are my age that have like you know one of my friends has a has a has a beach house and owns like at least two or three businesses and I'm just like damn girl what you doing um so uh if you want to maximize wealth you need to get in on the bandwagon of fourth Industrial Revolution Technologies now my my my Val my value my wealth is in my public reputation so that's what I'm going to Parlay with you know like my books and my YouTube channel and everything else um need some water give me just a second um so there are two different things and so this is is where I've talked about the the meaning economy is part of what's changing as well as the status economy and so those are two kind of ways of looking at it so the meaning economy is about having a career or occupation that is tied to human meaning so that's humano human interaction whether it's experiences remember relationships experiences and Mission so if you can help people with that which is what that that's what I do I'm I'm like I'm part of the meaning economy I'm part of the next wave um if you can help people with that you'll be okay financially um but then also if you can participate directly in a fourth industrial revolution technology that's where you can get the more material wealth um is that the right way to go I don't know but that's that's kind of where where I see it going good question um all right let's see who's up so it looks like we're a little bit running out of steam some of these questions aren't getting upvoted so I know people are still hanging out so check check out on the QA and upvote any questions that you want to get you want to get answered uh but it looks like Pablo's is is next so let's get Pablo up all right Pablo what you got hi Dave yeah so this is more like a personal question actually I'm no native English speaker okay so when you mention for example yeah English skills is something that you have to develop I'm quite confused first of communication skills maybe is just English Focus or more broad communication skills and this is related with AI of course M and also I interested in your view or or maybe your personal experience of how to handle these people skills and these kind of things and maybe contextualize with this new technologies for example I also have been developed some small applications to for example uh correct grammar issues for my personal Tes with AI or maybe like just to um split a pro a personal problem that I have had so I think uh this could also Lish this development of his people skills and personal skills so yeah yeah good question so uh first English is valuable um English English is generally is generally valuable but there are aspects of communicating with people with all humans that are Universal um just verbal communication skills presentation skills getting out in front of people like like I'm at now um that is that is another example of people skills or communication skills that I that I'm talking about negotiation um negotiation is a huge thing where particularly if you think in the future where you know your living situation might change or if there's New Economic paradigms that are more communal or more decentralized your ability to present your opinions and beliefs and facts and the ability to conduct meetings um and those sorts of things like rhetorical skill these are all Universal skills skills regardless of what language you're using and language might actually be a non-issue particularly as real-time translation gets better which means that like you know you could be communicating with me in your native language and I hear it with your voice but in English and then vice versa that's coming very very soon and I would I would be shocked if this time next year um Zoom doesn't have that built in where it's just like everything I hear is in English and everything that you hear is in um your native language which I'm guessing is Spanish I could be wrong um but you know and that sort of thing is coming so which language is less important than understanding the theory of mind so like you know what hum like how humans tick and that sort of thing and I saw that someone was asking for books so um I'll drop in chat the um my book list I just published it on GitHub um it's literally every book that I've read and there's a lot of negotiation books and and communication and relationship books on there um so let me drop that in chat and you can take a look at that if you want um but yeah so in terms of Sy systematic about it there's so there's basically theory and practice that's that's all there comes down to so you can read a book um there's a bunch of books on communication and storytelling that I read and then you just have to get out and practice um but knowing what to practice and what to pay attention to is is invaluable um and and I'm I'm not the same person that I was 10 years ago in terms of presentation skills and and everything um but yeah so good question any any other parts of that you want to follow up on um yeah about the contextualization of these AI Technologies maybe it can help into this process or how do yeah yeah so you mentioned that you solved your own problem that's actually one of the number one Cardinal rules is solve a problem that you have uh and that that's a really good place to start have you read the book uh crossing the chasm have you come across that one no no um so if if you're trying to build an AI product you need to read crossing the C um like that will explain so much to you about how to get feedback on your product um whether you have one user or 10 or 10 million um you need to integrate feedback quickly and iterate quickly that is the number one most true thing it has been true for the last 10 years and will and is even more true now because iteration Cycles have to be faster yeah someone just dropped a link to crossing the chasm in the chat so that is as a systematic approach like that is that is if you only read one book on technology and startups that is the book you should read in my opinion um and then and then put it into practice uh but yes and start with a problem like solve your own problem as as good as you can start there because you're not the only person with that problem and that will allow you to carve out a really powerful Market Niche but then it's just a matter of iterating and integrating that feedback and making sure that you can interpret that feedback that data that Telemetry that you're getting and and do experiments um to make sure that the theory that you develop as to what is it that people are using and why um and and kind of double down on that nice how that you you're welcome good question good question all right I think uh we had a few more questions pop up uh Kyle likes my reading list um okay so Anonymous man you're on fire I want to know who who this is ping ping me on on disc or uh or patreon because you're asking good questions okay so this is a longer one so Anonymous asks with endless life how will the possibility of the immortal Elite navigate the vast oceans of their memories and What mechanisms might they employ to curate suppress or enhance recollection could we see the emergence of memory banks selected memory editing or the even the Outsourcing of memories to AI reshaping and and uh reshaping identity and personal history so in the short term I think that that that just Rejuvenation alone will probably enhance people's memory quite a bit um there's even evidence that once you treat Alzheimer's like in Mouse models they actually are able to retrieve memories that seemed like they were lost and so I suspect that Rejuvenation therapy alone will get us most of the way where we need to be um now in terms of you know how much memory you have um there's a book and it's actually on the reading list called the forgetting machine and actually human memory is remarkable because of how little you actually need to remember things and so if you're familiar with programming the way that human memory works and it's not like it's not exactly like this this is just a metaphor um but human memories are sparse and so this is actually where I got the idea of sparse priming representations was when you recall something you're recalling bits and pieces and so rather than remembering each scene in your life as one thing you say okay this person so it's like here's my wife and you have a she's one archetype in your your your brain one tic image is what some people call it um and so there's there's one representation of this person and every memory you have of that person just references that one image and so human memory is actually incredibly efficient um and so some people think that there's actually no limit to human memory um except for you know old age and your your brain starts to Decay now in terms of offloading um nope books humans have been offloading memory for centuries um there's I mean AI might be able to help you know if you have if you have an AI agent on your phone that listens to everything that you do um but yeah there's not really like from a technological standpoint like you know okay you know one one tool or another they're pretty much interchangeable at this point um let's see if there's any other thing let's see memory banks so yeah like a journal as a memory bank selective memory editing I don't think that's going to be necessary um I think I think probably what will happen and I saw this it might have been in a love death and robots episode um but basically like some people live for live so long that you kind of forget your original who you were but like that's not really going to happen for probably centuries until like you've been so far divorced from your childhood that those memories are no longer relevant and so then like you're your personal narrative of who you are is going to be like a rolling window of the last like 200 years or so um that I don't know if that's possible again just just Rejuvenation therapy alone might make that not happen but then also over the next 200 years the amount of potential cognitive Improvement through genetic manipulation like you know your brain might be millions and millions of times more efficient than it is today or something I don't know so interesting question though all right I think I'll answer one more it's only got two up votes but there's still plenty of people hanging in so I will I will answer this one so another one from Anonymous um let's see do you think that there will be any geographic area that will be that will act as a neutral zone or mediating body in the coming conflict um I mean Nations not an institution yeah so there's basic I mean the global South is probably going to be mostly untouched with the exception of like you know um some of Southeast Asia and India I think India might be conflict Zone um but most of South America Australia most of Africa except for local Civil Wars and and and and those Regional conflicts most areas are probably going to be largely untouched um by by this coming conflict in the next five years if I had to guess um obviously like I I can't tell the future um but when you look at historically patterned like calling World War I and World War II world wars was a little bit ambitious um gu it was in every hemisphere but I mean there were so many places that the war just did not come to um now if I had to say like if you're in Europe like Sweden looks pretty safe seden is Sweden is is uh wedge between Norway and Finland and geography is on Sweden's side also Sweden has a really good um military and and uh and Industrial base um so Sweden Switzerland they're probably fine if you're in Europe uh just due to geography because again geography is Destiny um Australia being that most of it is empty um if you live in the Australian Outback or you know some of the more remote places on in Australia there's not much value there like yes there's still World War II wrecks and stuff off the coast of Australia but there was not a whole lot of action seen seen in Australia as far as as far as I know um and again because there's not many resources there like there's not much reason to go there and there's also not that many people I think Australia's population is what like 30 million or something like that um so you know it's like okay there's there's potential for solar Farms um but yeah so that's that's that's that um there's lots of places uh but pay attention to geography man uh deep valleys uh high mountain ranges big Rivers like yeah you can you can get pretty well insulated um in places so um I think we'll call it a day there thanks everyone for jumping in and asking really good questions this was a super engaging um I like I like uh this new this uh this new topic so cheers everybody have a good have a good uh good weekend happy Friday all right oh and I'll P I'll publish the recording here soon too it takes a couple hours to to process all right bye everybody",
