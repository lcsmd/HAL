  "transcript": "Google Deep Mind wakes up this morning and releases Gemini 1.5 Pro that's now available in public preview on Google's cloud and vertex AI platforms which is actually really cool we'll look at this in just a second and they announced the new and improved imagin 2 that's able to create 4C live images from a single prompt crashing waves mountain range of course opening eyes like this can I be we got to drop something too so GPT for Turbo with vision is now generally available in the API so it's out of the preview mode and has been rolled out with some important improvements so there isn't a huge amount of specifics about what was improved here's what's new so this is the new model GPT 4 Turbo F Vision the latest gp4 turbo model with vision capabilities Vision requests can now use Json mode and function calling 128,000 token context window and training data up to December 2023 they also give some examples of what developers are building with vision and they're saying drop whatever you're building in the reply as well they highlight Devon Devon AI has been making tons of noise tons of waves it's an AI software engineering assistant powered by GPT 4 Turbo that uses vision for a variety of tasks by the way not everyone's convinced that Devon and the demos that have been shown are the real deal they think that there may be some Shenanigans that's going on in internet of bugs is a new YouTube channel relatively new one month old that's gaining some traction pointing out some of the issues with these AI software development demos latest video debunking Devon first AI software engineer upw Cai exposed he specifically takes a look at this demo that cognition the company behind Devon posted showing Devon's upwork side Hustle the internet of bugs Channel goes through and does a thorough debunking of what the video claimed including a 30-minute un edited footage of him going through and doing everything that Devon did supposedly to complete that task now we've covered Ethan mik's work where he gets the Devon AI agent to go on Reddit and start a thread where it's going to take actual website building requests and it does that solving numerous problems along the way even at some point uh attempting to charge people for the work as Ethan MOG says agents are going to open a whole bunch of cans of worms these cans of warms are things like knowing who is real and who is not online how does the jobs and economy change when a lot of these jobs can be automated by these agents how does remote work change how does software development change how do we protect against things like civil attacks DDOS attacks like there's a million questions that if you imagine these agents will continue developing and getting better right there's a whole bunch of cans of worms that are going to open and these agents are the can openers that's not not even a joke it's not me being funny it's just what's coming now if agent Trader here is correct then maybe these changes aren't quite as close as we think there are maybe the reliability of agents still hasn't been solved quite that well yet and software Engineers have nothing yet to fear because that specific skill set is still Irreplaceable things like Devon AI will be an assistant a very important assistant that's going to allow them to build more do a lot of the boring tasks just kind of improve their product ity instead of actually replacing that work now me calling him agent shider is a joke cuz he looks like Hank shider from Breaking Bad I don't actually know his real name also another company is Health ifim me who built snap using GPT for Turbo Vision to give users nutrition insights through photo recognition of foods from around the world TL draw we covered this in another video If you haven't played with this thing I highly highly suggest you do imagine something like Microsoft Paint where you just paint whatever you want on the screen right you paint buttons and you make little annotations you write out what you want then you click make it real and this thing makes it real it uses GPT 4 Vision to take whatever you've just doodled and turn it into an actual version an actual software of of what you did so things I've tried for example drawing a game and then have it actually make that game Real Time take seconds to code that game up I mean there's simple games one of them was like running around chasing chickens in a little enclosure but you can do web pages you can do forms you can do tons and tons of stuff it is surprisingly good and I think something like this will be the future of user interface design just because of how quickly you can just get stuff out there kind of tested iterated Etc Google deep Minds image in to can now make little 4-second live images from a single prompt if you wanted to try the image in two just the regular image in two the image effects is probably the easiest way of doing it it's pretty good I was surprised I still prefer mid Journey but Google is getting very good at image generation in other news Google Cloud announces updates to Gemini imag in Gemma and mlops on vertex AI so Gemma has been improved the small open source model from Google kind of like the open source version of Gemini that might be an accurate way to describe it Gemini 1.5 Pro on vertex AI also supports processing audio inputs including music speech and even the audio portion of video it can give high quality transcriptions or be used to search and analyze multimodal content so in the Google Cloud you can find the vertx AI Studio Vision looks like you're able to generate images and you can request access here I don't have it yet but it looks like I have the Gemini experimental which is the default setting for me and then you do have this Gemini 1.5 Pro preview 0409 so I'm guessing that's April 9th today if a 1 million context window so we might do a deeper dive into this but it is looks like it is available and looks like yeah it does have the 1 million context window which I have to say is kind of exciting as we've covered before the paper show that it's really good at doing for example finding the needle in the H stack so if you have a large document and need to find a specific thing in that document it will do so very well 1 million context window is of course massive and Gemini 1.5 Pro was very good at a number of tasks the jump from 1.0 to 1.5 was pretty massive I believe if I recall correctly the big change was they went to mixture of experts so kind of copying the GPT 4 design and making kind of a big leap forward so we might test this out in a different video but if you wanted to play around here's how you can do it the Google cloud has a free trial it doesn't autocharge you at the end so if you wanted to jump in and uh mess around with it it's you can do so for free they have text to speech and speech to text hello there happy to be here the voice sound okay pretty good here's uh we're going to try to generate a caption for this lovely lovely thumbnail I made more agents is all you need with these uh wonderful little friendly little kitties caption reads four hairless cats are sitting at a table with the words more agents is all you need above them I mean that's pretty perfect they nailed it they're sitting at a table yeah I got to say this is excellent now we don't quite yet know what exactly has changed we're probably going to see how much better the model is once we start testing it once we start playing around with it it has been added to the Gladiator arena for llm chat Bots to see which one is the best so the added GPT 4 Turbo the 409 version this is what that looks like you basically get assign to random models model a Model B you're not told what it is but you're able to put in your prompt and then see how well they respond I'm going to say right quick screenplay about Hank Shader and Walter White talking about using AI to do their jobs the scene is set at Walter's house in the backyard as they make barbecue and off they go Model A and model B Walter starts smirking you know Hank I've been thinking Hank raising eyebrow oh great another one of your brilliant ideas what's this one all right so that's a good start I got to say Walter leaning in what if we use AI to do our jobs Hank are you serious you want to replace me with a robot Walter no no not replace augment improve efficiency you know like using a computer to analyze data instead of sifting through mounds of paperwork okay I got to say so so far Model A whatever it is is excellent they really capture the Precision of the words that Walter uses the Simplicity of how Hank talks so Model A did an excellent job and model B I mean it's okay but it's very very basic right so it just kind of repeats some talking points about AI you know oh AI could write up reports for me and Walter is like but it might put you out of a job kind of simplistic not bad it's okay writing but a is significantly better and now they revealed that model A was open chat 3.5 and model B was CLA 3 High coup which is surprising let's take a look at the leaderboards so CLA 3 High coup the ELO rating the arena rating that they have for it is 1182 whereas open chat is much lower at well much lower on the rankings but not that much lower on the um actual the rating right so it's 1097 and currently we have CLA 3 Opus as our reing King it has recently surpassed GPT 4 interestingly Bard from Gemini Pro is right behind basically the third model that's ranked right so we have Claude GPT 4 then we have Bard so it's number four but it's the third best model right if you look at GPT these two versions of GPT 4 as you know the same model then we have a new competitor the command R plus that we have to look into because this has been making a lot of waves a lot of people are questioning if it does indeed belong on here we'll do a full Deep dive into this later but the point is that very soon we're going to see the new model up here I guess it'll be called gp4 turbo 20244 d09 and we'll be able to see exactly where it falls will open ey take back their crown and become the number one once again I mean I got to say here GPT 4 and Claw 3 Opus are neck to neck they're two points apart which you can say is not even I mean they're they're pretty much the same the difference might not be statistically significant with that said my name is Wes rth make sure you're subscribed think there's going to be some big news coming soon and thank you for watching",
