write a program in QMBasic that is part of the openQM multivalue database system, that allows for the creation, listing, editing, deletion and compiling of text prompt templates.  the program name should be PROMPT.TEMPLATE.MAN.  
the prompt templates are essentially text files that are saved with a .pt extension in a directory named PROMPT.TEMP   
they can be long strings and can consist of multiple lines. 
  
The prompt templates can be created or edited just like text files edited with the text editor nano or notepad. 

the program accepts a prompt template name and if it doesnt exist, a new blank prompt template is created with the name specified. 
if the prompt template already exists then it should be loaded into nano or notepad for editing.    
the program should  allow the user to edit the text by moving up and down the text using the four arrow keys, deleting text in the string using the del and backspace keys, and inserting at the cursor position with any text that is typed.  
when the [ key is pressed, it should be inserted in the text and a list of all the names of the  prompt templates in the PROMPT.TEMP directory (except for the current prompt template) should be listed and the user can select any of those prompt templates and the name of that prompt template should be inserted after the [ and then followed by a ] character.  
this will create a placeholder for nesting prompt templates.  
the user should be able to save the prompt template by hitting control-x and entering a name, if its  a new prompt, or be allowed to alter the existing name if it exists.   
the user can include variables in the prompt templates by surrounding the variable name with {}.  
the program should allow for prompt templates to be created, edited, deleted or compiled.  

when a prompt template is compiled:
 the first thing should be to look for nested prompt templates and any nested prompt templates as indicated by the nested prompt templates enclosed in [].  these should be replaced by reading the prompt template from the PROMPT.TEMP file and replacing that placeholder with the text of the template instead of the name.  
the nested prompt template may have its own prompt templates included as well and these should be recursively replaced when compiling the prompt template.  

next, if  there are any variables included in the template as indicated by {}, the user should be prompted with the variable name and allowed to specify a value for that variable. all instances of  the variable should be replaced by the value specified.  

the resulting text should be saved as a text file in the PROMPTS directory with the extension .pr.  another text file should be created  where the the first line of the text file is the name of the template used to produce the prompt.  subsequent lines should consist of each unique variable name that was found in the prompt template followed by == then followed by the value that the user supplied when the prompt template was compiled. 

this should be saved as a text file in the PROMPTS directory with the same name as the prompt but with a .vr extension.
