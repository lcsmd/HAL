MVConnect for QM

The installer will have placed the MVConnect programs in either the private
or global catalogue directory and created the VOC entry for the WEBSVC simple
web services program.

The command to activate the web server is
   WEBSVC MVCONNECTSVR PORT 8180
where the apapropriate port number should be specified.

There is an optional DEBUGGING qualifier to this command that will create a
simple log file in $COMO.

To run the post-installation test, open your browser and navigate to
   http://<ip of box>:8180/api/wresttest

Endpoints are created by creating new entries in WDB.RESOURCE. This file will
be automatically created if it does not already exist. Two default items will
be created, a CONFIG item and a testing endpoint API*WRESTTEST.

The api endpoint format is <HANDLER>*<ENDPOINT>.  This relates to
http://ip/<HANDLER>/<ENDPOINT>.

When MVConnect processes a request it will pull the first two elements in the
url and http://ip/<HANDLER>/<ENDPONT> called HANDLER and ENDPOINT and
concantenate them with a * and look it up in WDB resource. The format of the
WDB resource file is
   1> P
   2> Free text description
   3> Name of program to run.
   4> Not used for REST
   5> Parse cgi (1 yes).
   6> Enabled (1 yes)
   7> Populate wdb.debug file (1 yes, only works if file already exists)
   8> Account to logto before running #3


 WDEBUG

Transactions can be recorded and re-ran with WDEBUG. To run this on

   1. Enter a 1 in attributes 7 of the WDB.RESOURCE file
   2. Hit the service with your browser
   3. From TCL run WDEBUG. It will list recorded transaction and you can
      replay them
