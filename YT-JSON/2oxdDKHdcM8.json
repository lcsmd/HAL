        "transcript": "the following is a conversation with Ivanka Trump businesswoman real estate developer and former senior advisor to the president of the United States I've gotten to know ianka well over the past two years we've become good friends hitting it off right away over our mutual love of reading especially philosophical writings from Marcus aurelus Joseph cble Ellen was Victor Frankl and so on she is a truly kind compassionate and thoughtful human being in the past people have attacked her in my view to get indirectly at her dad Donald Trump as part of a dirty game of politics and clickbait journalism these attacks obscured many projects and efforts often bipartisan that she helped get done and they obscured the truth of who she is as a human being through all that she never returned the attacks with anything but kindness and always walked walked through the fire of it all with grace for this and much more she is an inspiration and I'm honored to be able to call her a friend oh and uh for those living in the United States happy upcoming 4th of July it's both an anniversary of this country's Declaration of Independence and an anniversary of my immigrating here to the US I am forever grateful grateful for this amazing country for this amazing life for all of you who have given the chance to a silly kid like me from the bottom of my heart thank you I love you all this is the Lex Freedman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's Ivanka Trump you said that ever since you were young you wanted to be a builder that you loved the idea of Designing beautiful city skylines especially in New York City I love the New York City skyline so uh describe the origins of that love of building you know I think there's both an incredible confidence and a total insecurity that comes with youth so I remember at 15 I would look out over the city skyline for my bedroom window in New York and imagine where I could contribute and and add value in a way that you know I look back on and and completely laugh at you know how confident I was but I've I've known since some of my earliest memories it's something I've wanted to do and I think I fundamentally I love art I love expressions of of Beauty in so many different forms um with architecture there's the tangible and I think that marriage of of function and something that exists Beyond yourself is very compelling I also grew up in a family where my mother was in the real estate business working alongside my father my father was in the business and I saw the joy that it brought to them so I think I had these natural positive associations they used to send me as a little girl renderings of projects they were about to embark on with notes asking if I would hurry up and finish school so I could come join them so I had these positive associations but I came from something within myself I think that as I got older and as I got involved in real estate I realized that it was so multidisciplinary you have of course the design but you also have engineering the brass tax of construction there's time management there's project planning just the duration of time to complete one of these iconic structures it's enormous you can contribute a decade of your life to one project so while you have to think big picture it means you really have to care deeply about the details because you you live with them so it um it allowed me to flex a lot of areas of Interest I love that confidence of Youth it's funny because we're all so insecure right in the most basic interactions but yet our Ambitions are so unbridled in a way that kind of like makes you blush as an adult and I think it's fun it's fun to like tap into that energy yeah where everything is possible I think some of the the greatest Builders I've ever met kind of always have that little flame of everything is possible still burning that is a silly notion from youth but it's not so silly you know everybody tells you something is impossible but if you continue believing that it's possible and have that sort of naive notion that you could do it even if it's exceptionally difficult that naive notion turns into some of the greatest projects ever done 100% you know going out to space or uh building a new company where like everybody says it's impossible taking on that gigantic company and uh uh disrupting them and revolutionizing how stuff is done or doing huge building projects where like you said so many people are involved in making that happen we get conditioned out of that feeling yeah we start to become insecure and it's we start to rely on the input or validation of others and it takes us away from that sort of core drive and um and ambition so it's it's it's fun to to reflect on that and also to smile right because whether you can execute or not time will tell but um but yeah no that was that was very much my childhood yeah of course it's important to also have the humility once you get humbled and realize that it's actually a lot of work to build I still am amazed just looking at big buildings big bridges that human beings are able to get together and build those things that's one of my my favorite things about architecture is just like wow it's it's a a manifestation of the fact that humans can collaborate and do something like epic much bigger than themselves and it's like a statue that represents that and it can be there for a long time I think in in some ways you look out at at different city skylines and it's it's almost like um a visual depiction of ambition realized right like it's a testament to somebody's dream to not somebody a whole um Ensemble of people's dreams and and Visions um and triumphs and in some cases failures um if the projects weren't properly executed so so you look at these skylines and and and it's a testament that I actually heard once architecture described as Frozen music that that really resonated with me I love thinking about a city skyline as an ensemble of Dreams realized yeah I remember the first time I I went to um Dubai and I was watching them dredging out and and creating these man-made islands and I remember somebody once saying to me there an architect um an architect actually who collaborated with us on on our Tower in Chicago he said that the only thing that limited what an architect could do in that area was gravity and Imagination so it's it's you know yeah but gravity is a trick want to work against and that's where civil engineer is one of my favorite things I used to build uh bridges in high school for physics classes you have to build Bridges and you compete on how much weight they can carry relative to their own weight yeah you study how good it is by finding its breaking point and that was a deep appreciation for me on the miniature scale of on the large scale what people are able to do with civil engineering because gravity is a tricky one to fight against it definitely is and bridges I mean some of the iconic designs in in our country are incredible Bridges so if we think of uh skylines as ensembles of Dreams realized you spent quite a bit of time in New York what what do you love about and what do you think about the New York City skyline what's a good picture we're looking here at a few I mean looking over the water well I think the water is an unbelievable feature of the New York skyline um as you see the island on approach and often times you'll see like in these images you'll see these towers reflecting off of the water surface so I think there's something very beautiful and um and unique about that when I look at New York I I see this unbelievable sort of tapestry of different types of architecture so you have the gothic form um as represented by buildings like the Woolworth Building or you'll have Art Deco as represented by buildings like 40 Wall Street or the Chrysler Building or Rockefeller Center and uh and then you'll have these unbelievable super modern examples or modernist examples like lever house and serum's house so you have all of these different styles and I think to build in New York you're really building the best of the best so nobody's giving New York their sort of second rate work um and uh especially when a lot of those buildings were built there was this incredible competition happening between New York and Chicago for kind of dominance of the sky and for who could create the greatest Skyline that sort of raced to the sky when skyscrapers were first being built starting in Chicago and and then New York surpassing that in terms of height at least um with with the Empire State Building so I love sort of contextualizing the skylines as well and thinking back to um when different components that are so iconic were were added in in the context in which they came into being I got to ask you about this there's a pretty cool page uh that I've been following on X architecture and tradition and they celebrate sort of traditional uh schools of architecture and you mentioned Gothic the tapestry this is in Chicago the tribun Tower in Chicago so what do you think about that sort of the the old and the new mix together do you like Gothic I think it's hard to look at something like the Tribune Tower and not be completely in awe I think this is an unbelievable Building look at those buttresses and you've got gargoyles hanging off of it and you know this style was remniscent of the cathedrals of Europe which was very kind of invogue in like the 19 20s here in here in America actually I mentioned the Woolworth Tower before the Woolworth Tower was actually referred to as the Cathedral of Commerce um and because it it also was in that Gothic style amazing so this was built maybe a decade before the Tribune building but the Tribune building to me is is it's almost not replicable it personally really resonates with me because one of the first projects I ever worked on was building Trump Chicago which was this beautiful elegant super modern All Glass skyscraper right across the way so it was right across the river so I would look out the windows um as it was under construction or or be standing quite literally on rebar of the building looking out at at the Tribune and and Incredibly inspired and now the reflective glass of the building reflects back not only the river but but also um the Tribune building and other buildings on Michigan Avenue do you like it when the glass the reflective properties of of the glass as part of the architecture I think it depends like they have super reflective glass that sometimes doesn't work it's distracting and um I I think it it's it's one component of um sort of a composition that comes together I think in this case the glass on on Trum Chicago is very beautiful it was uh designed by Adrien Smith of um Skidmore Owings and merilla a major Architecture Firm who actually did um the Burge Khalifa in Dubai which is I think like an awe inspiring example of of modern architecture but glass is tricky it's you have to get the shade right um you know some glass has a lot of iron in it and get super green um and that's a choice and uh sometimes you have more blue properties blue silver like you see here but it's it's it's part of the character how do you know what it's actually going to look like when it's done like is it possible to imagine that because it feels like there's so many variables I think so I think if you have a vivid imagination if you sit with it and then if you also go beyond the rendering right you have to you have to live with materials so you don't build a 92 story building glass curtain wall and not deeply examine the actual curtain wall before purchasing it so you have to spend a lot of time with the actual materials not just um the beautiful sort of artistic renderings um which can be incredibly misleading um the goal is actually that the the end result is much much more compelling um than than what the AR architect or artist rendered but often times that's very much not the case you know sometimes also you mention context you know sometimes I'll see renderings of buildings I'm like wait what about the building right to the left of it that's blocking 80% of its views of the you know they'll the you know Architects they'll remove things that are inconvenient they'll so so you have to you have to be rooted in in reality in reality exactly and I love the notion of living with the with the materials in contrast to living in the imagined world of the drawings so the the both both are probably important cuz you have to dream the thing into existence but you also have to be rooted in like what thing is actually going to look like in the context of everything else 100% one of the underlying principles of the page I just mentioned and I hear folks mention this a lot is that uh modern architecture is kind of boring that it lacks soul and beauty and you just spoke with admiration for both modern and for Gothic for older uh architectur so do you think there's truth that the modern architecture is boring I'm living in Miami currently so I see a lot of super uninspired glass boxes on on the waterfront but um but I think exceptional things shouldn't be the norm you know they're typically rare so and I think in modern architecture you find an abundance of amazing examples of of super compelling and and Innovative building designs I mean I mentions the bur Khalifa it is a inspiring this is an unbelievably striking example of modern architecture you look at some older examples the Sydney Opera house and you know so so I think there's unbelievable there you go I mean it's like a needle in the sky yeah reaching out to the Stars it's it's huge and in the context of a city where there's a lot of height yeah um so it's it's unbelievable but I think one of the things that's probably exciting me the most about architecture right now is the Innovation that's happening within it you know there's example of robotic fabrication there's 3D printing um your friend and and who you introduced me to not too long ago ner oxman which she's doing at the intersection of biology and technology and thinking about how to create more sustainable development practices quite literally trying to create materials that will biodegrade back into the Earth I think there's something really cool happening now with the rediscovery of ancient building techniques so you have self-healing concrete that was used by the Romans an art and a practice of using volcanic ash and lime that's now being rediscovered and is more critical than ever as we think about how much of our infrastructure relies on concrete and how much of that is failing on the most basic level so I think actually it's a really really exciting time um for innovation in architecture and I think there are some incredible examples of of of modern design that are are really exciting but generally I think Roosevelt said that comparison is the thief of Joy so it's hard you know you look at the Tribune building you look at some of these iconic structures one of um the buildings I'm most proud to have worked on was the historic old post office building in Washington DC you look at a building like that and it feels like it has no equal also there's a just psychological element where people tend to want to complain about the new and celebrate the old oh it's like the history of time so it's just people are always skeptical and concerned about change yeah and it's true that there's a lot of stuff that's new that's not good it's not going to last it's not going to stand the test of time but some things will and there's uh just like in modern art there's and modern music there's going to be artists that uh stand the test of time and we'll later look back and celebrate them those were the good times yeah when you just step back what do you love about architecture is it the beauty is it the function I'm most emotionally drawn obviously to the beauty but I think as somebody who's built things I really believe that the form has to follow the function like there's nothing uglier than a space that is ill conceived that that you know otherwise it's it's it's decoration and I think that after sort of that initial reaction to seeing something that's aesthetically really pleasing to me when I when I look at a um when I look at a building or or a project I love sort of thinking about how it's being used so having been able to build so many things and um in my career and and worked on so many incredible projects I mean it's really really rewarding after the fact to have somebody come up to you and and tell you that they got engaged in the lobby of your building or they got married in the ballroom and um and share with you some of those experiences so so to me that's equally as beautiful um the the use cases for for these unbelievable projects but but I think I think it's all of it I I love I love that you've got the construction and you've got the design and you've got then the interior design and you've got the financing elements the marketing elements and it's all wrapped up in um in this one effort so so to me it's exciting to sort of flex in all those different ways yeah like you says it's dreams realized hard work real realized um I mean probably on the bridge side is why I love the function in terms of function being primary you just think of like the millions oh my gosh Bridges uh go go down you had look at that yeah this is Devil's Bridge in Germany yeah I wouldn't say it's like the most practical to but look how beautiful that is yeah so this is probably well we don't know we need to inter some people whether the function holds up but in terms of beauty and then like like what we're talking about using the water for the reflection and the shape that creates I mean there's an Elegance to the shape of a of a bridge see it's interesting that they call it Devil's Bridge because to me this is very ethereal you know I think about the ring the circle um life there's nothing about this that makes me feel maybe they're just being ironic in the name that functions really flaw yeah exactly maybe but he's ever successfully crossed crossed the bridge yeah but I mean to me there's just iconic I love looking at Bridges because because of the function it's the Brooklyn Bridge or the Golden Gate Bridge I mean those are probably my favorites in the United States just in a city to be able to look out and see the skyline combined with the suspension bridge and thinking of all the millions of cars that pass like the busyness like us humans get getting together and going to work building cool stuff and just the Bridge kind of represents the turmoil and the busyness of a city as it creates it's cool and the connectivity as well yeah the network of roads all come together so the there the bridge is the ultimate combination of function and and Beauty yeah I remember when I was first learning about bridges studying the cable stay um versus the suspension bridge and I mean you actually built many replicas so I'm sure you'll have a point of view on this but they really are um so beautiful and you mentioned the Brooklyn Bridge but growing up in New York that was as much a part of the architectural story and tapestry of that Skyline as any building that's that's seen in it so what in general is your philosophy philosophy of design and building and architecture well some of the most recent projects I I worked on prior to government service were the Old Post Office building and almost simultaneously Trump Dalal in Miami so these were both two just massive undertakings both redevelopments which in a lot of cases having worked on groundup construction Redevelopment projects are in a lot of ways much more complicated because you have existing attributes but also a lot of limitations you have to work within especially when you're repurposing a use so so this um the post office building on Pennsylvania Avenue was so beautiful it's unbelievable so this was a Romanesque Revival building um built in the 1890s on America's Main Street to symbolize American Grandeur and um at the time there were post office being built in in the style across the country but this being really the defining one still to this day the tallest habitable structure in Washington um the tallest structure being the monument the nation's only vertical Park which is that clock tower but you've got these thick Granite walls those carved Granite turrets um just just an unbelievable building you've got this massive um Atrium that that runs through the whole um center of it that is is topped with glass so so having the opportunity to to spearhead a project like that was was so exciting and actually it was my first renovation project so I I came to it with a tremendous amount of energy Vigor and and humility um about how to do it properly ensuring I had all the right people we had countless Federal and local government agencies that would oversee every single decision we made but in advance of even having the opportunity to do it there was a close to 2year request for proposal like a process that was put out by um the general Services Administration so it's this really arduous government procurement process that we were competing against so many different people for the opportunity um which a lot of people said it was a gigantic waste of time but I looked at that and I think so did a lot of the other biders and say it's worth trying to put the best Vision forward so you fell in love with this project I fell in love yeah so what is there some interesting details about what it takes to do renovation is there about some some of the challenges es or opportunities cuz you you want to maintain the beauty of the old yeah and now like upgrade the functionality I guess and maybe modernize some aspects of it without destroying what made the the building magical in the first place so I think the greatest asset was already there MH the exterior of the building which we meticulously restored and any addition into it had to be done sort of very gently um in terms of any signage additions and um the interior spaces were completely dilapitated it had been in a post office then we was used for a really rundown food court and government office spaces it was actually losing $6 million a year um when when we got um the concession to to build it and and when we we won and and became one of I think a great example of public private Partnerships working together but the I think the biggest challenge in having such a radical use conversion is just how you lay it out so the amount of time I would get on that Accel twice a week um three times a week to spend day trips down in Washington and we would walk every single inch of the building laying out the floor plans debating over the configuration of a room the almost 300 rooms and there were almost 300 layouts so nothing could be repeated uh whereas when you have when you're building from scratch you tend you know you have a box and you decide where you want to add you know potential elements and um and you kind of can stack the floor plan all the way up but when you're working within a building like this every single room was different you see the setback so the setback then required you to move the pluming so there was no um it was really a labor of love and to do something like this and and that's why I think renovation we had it with deral as well it was 700 rooms over um over 650 Acres of of property and so every single unit was was very different and complicated not not as complicated in some ways the scale of it was so massive but not as complicated as the old post office but it requ requ ired a level of of precision and I think in real estate you have a lot of people who design on plan um and a lot of people who are in the business of sort of acquiring and flipping so it's more financial engineering than it is building and they don't spend the time sort of sweating these details that make something great and make something functional and you feel it in the end result um but I I mean Blood Sweat tears years of my life for for those projects and and it was worth it I I enjoyed almost I enjoyed almost every minute of it so to you it's not about the flipping to you it's about the art of the and the function of the thing that you're creating 100% what's design on plan I'm learning you things today um when when proposals are put forth by an architect and and really just the plan is accepted without and in the case of a renovation like if you're not walking those rooms the number of times a beautifully laid out room was on a blueprint and then I'd go to Washington and I'd walk that floor and I'd realize that there was a column that ran right up through the middle of the space where you know the bed was supposed to be or the toilet was supposed to be or um or the shower so there's a lot of things that are missed um when you do something conceptually without sort of rooting it and um in the actual structure and that's why I think even you know with groundup construction as well people who aren't constantly on their job sites constantly walking the projects there's just a lot that's there's a lot that's missed I mean there's a wisdom to the the idea that we talked about before live with the materials and walking the construction site walk in the rooms I mean that's what you hear from people like Steve Jobs like Elon that's why you live in the factory floor that's why you constantly obsess about the details the actual not of the the plans but the physical reality of the product I mean the the insanity of Steve Jobs and Johnny I working together on like making it perfect making the iPhone the early designs prototypes making that perfect like what it actually feels like in the hand you have to be there like as close to the metal as possible to truly understand and you have to love it in order to do that right shouldn't be about the how much he's going to sell for all that kind of stuff you have to love the art because for the most part you can probably get 90 maybe even 95% of the end result unless something has terribly gone arai by by not caring with that level of almost like maniacal Precision but you'll notice that 10% for the rest of your life you know so um I think I think that extra effort that that passion I think that's what separates good from great if we go back to that young ianka the uh the confidence of Youth and uh if you could talk about your mom she had a big influence on you you told me she was an adventurer yeah uh Olympic skier and a businesswoman uh what did you learn about life from your mother so much um she passed away two years ago now and and um she was a remarkable remarkable woman she was a Trailblazer in so many different ways um as an athlete and growing up in communist Czechoslovakia as um a fashion Mogul as a real estate executive and and Builder um just this allaround trailblazing businesswoman's I also learned from her you know aside from from that element how to really enjoy life you I look back and some of my happiest memories of her are in the ocean you know just lying on her back um looking up at the Sun and just so so in the moment or dancing she loved to dance so she um she really taught me a lot about living life to its fullest and um and she had so much courage so much conviction so much energy um and a complete comfort with who she was what do you think about that I mean Olympic Athlete the trade-off between like ambition and just wanting to do big things and pursuing that and giving your all to that and being able to relax and just throw your arms back and enjoy the mo every moment of life but like that tradeoff yeah what do you think about that tradeoff I think because she was this unbelievable formidable athlete and because of the dis she had as a child I think it made her value those moments more as an adult I think she was a great balance of the two that we all hope to find and she was able to find both incredibly serious and formidable I remember as a little girl I used to literally trapes behind her um at the Plaza hotel which um she over saww and actually kind of was her old post office it was this unbelievable Historic Hotel and in New York City and I'd follow her around at construction meetings and on job sites and um there she is dancing see that's funny that that's the picture you pull up I'm sorry the two you just look great in that picture that's great she had such a a joy to her and she was so unabashed and her perspective and her opinions I mean you know she made my father look reserved so whatever she was feeling what she was just very expressive um and and a lot of fun to be around so she uh as you mentioned uh grew up during the the Prague spring in uh 1968 and that had a big impact on human history I mean my my family came from the Soviet Union and then you know the 20th century the story of the 20th century is a lot of Eastern Europe uh the Soviet Union tried uh the ideas of um of Communism and it turned out that a lot of those ideas resulted into a lot of suffering so why do you think the Communist ideology failed I think fundamentally as people we desire Freedom we want agency you know and my mom was like a lot of other people who grew up in in similar situations where she didn't like to talk about it that often so one of my real regrets is that I didn't push her harder you know so but I think back to the conversations we did have and and I try to imagine what it's like she was at Charles University in in in Prague which was really like a focal point of um of the reforms that were ushered in during the Prague spring and the liberalization agenda that was happening the dance halls were opening the student activists and and she was attending University there right at that same time so the the contrast to this feeling of freedom and progress and liberalization in the spring and then it's so quickly being crushed in the fall of that same year when the Warsaw pack countries and uh and the Soviet Union rolled in to to put down and and ultimately roll back all those reforms so for her to have lived through that you know she didn't come to North America until she was uh 23 or 24 so that was her life as um as as a young girl she was on the junior National ski team for Czechoslovakia my my grandfather used to train her they used to put the skis on her back and walk up the mountain um in Czechoslovakia because there were no there were no ski lifs she actually made me do that when I was a child um just to to let me know uh what her experience had been if I complained that it was cold out she's like well you didn't have to walk up the mountain you'd be you'd be plenty warm if you had carried the skis up on your back on uh up the last run I feel like they made people tougher back then like my my grandma you mentioned it's funny they they go through some of the darkest things that a human being can go through and they don't talk about it and they have a general positive outlook on life like that's deeply rooted in the knowledge of what life could be yeah like how bad it could get my grandma survived uh hore in Ukraine which is was a mass starvation brought on by the collectivist policies of the Stalin regime and then she survived the Nazi occupation of Ukraine never talked about it probably went through extremely dark extremely difficult times and then just always had a positive outl look on life and also made me do very difficult physical activity like just you IM just to to Humble you like kids these days are soft kind of energy which I'm deeply deeply grateful for on all fronts including just having hardship and uh including just physical hardship flung at me I think that's really important you wonder how much of of who they were was a reaction to their experience you know which you have naturally had that sort of forward-looking grateful optimist IC orientation or was it a reaction to to her childhood I think about that you know I look at this picture of my mom and she was unabashedly herself you know she loved flamboyance and Glamour and and in some ways I think it probably was a direct reaction to this very austere controlled childhood you know this was one expression of it I think her you know how she dressed and how she presented I I think her entrepreneurial spirit and love of capitalism and all things American was was another manifestation of it and one that I grew up with I remember the story she used to tell me um about when she was uh 14 and she was going to neighboring countries and you know as an athlete you were given additional freedoms um that that you wouldn't otherwise be afforded in um in in these societies under under communist rules so she was able to travel where most of her friends never would be able to leave Czechoslovakia and she would come back from all of these trips and the first place where she'd do ski races in Austria and elsewhere and the first thing she had to do was check in at the local police and she'd sit down and she had enough wisdom at 14 to know that she couldn't appear to be lying by not being impressed by what she saw and the fact that you could get an orange in the window but she couldn't be too excited by it that she'd become a Flight Risk so give enough details boy that you're believable but not so many that you're not trusted and imagine that as a 14-year-old you know that experience and and having to navigate the world that way and um she told me that eventually all those local police officers they came to love her because one of the things she do is smuggle B stuff back from these countries and give it to them to give their wives perfume and stockings and so she figured out the system pretty quickly um but but it's it's a very different experience from what I was navigating and the pressures and challenges me as a 14-year-old was was dealing with so so I have so much respect and and admiration for her yeah hardship clarifies what's important in life uh you I've talked about man search for meaning that book uh having kind of an ultimate hardship clarifies that uh finding joy in life is not about the environment it's about your outlook on that environment and there's Beauty to be found in any situation yeah and also in that particular situation the when everything is taken from you the thing you start to think about is uh the people you love so in the case of man search for meaning Victor Franco thinking about his his wife and how much he loves her and that love was the flame that the the the warmth that kept him excited the fun thing to think about when everything else is gone so we sometimes forget that with the business of life you get all this fun stuff we're talking about like building and being a creative force in the world at the end of the day what matters is just like the other humans in your life the people you love it's the simple stuff you know Victor Frankle is is somebody I mean his that book and um just his philosophy in general is is um is so inspiring to me but I think so many people they say they want happiness but they want conditional happiness you know when this and this a thing happens or under these circumstances then I'll be happy and I think what he showed is that we can sort of cultivate these virtues within ourselves regardless of the situation we find ourselves in and in some ways I think the the meaning of life is the search for meaning in life it's the relationships we have and we form it's the experience we have it's how we deal with the suffering that life inevitably presents to us and uh and Victor Frankle does an amazing job highlighting that under the most horrific circumstances and I think it's it's just super inspiring to me he also shows that you can get so much from just like small Joys like getting a little more soup today than you did yesterday I mean it's like it's the little stuff if you allow yourself to love the little stuff of life it's all around you it's all there so you don't need to like have these ambitious goals and the comparison being a thief of joy that kind of stuff just like it's all around us the ability to eat like when I when I was in the jungle and I got severely dehydrated because there's no water you run out of water real quick and I mean the joy I felt when I got the drink like I didn't care about anything else speaking of things that matter in life I I I would start to fantasize about water and that was bringing me joy you can tap into this feeling at any time exactly I was just tapping in just to stay positive go your bathroom turn on the sink and watch the water for for sure I mean people really I it's good to have stuff taken away for a time that's why struggle is good to make you appreciate to have a deep gratitud for when you have it and water and food is a big one but water is the biggest one I I wouldn't recommend it necessarily to get severely dehydrated to appreciate water but maybe every time you take a sip of water you can have that kind of gratitude there's a a prayer in Judaism you're supposed to say every morning which is basically thanking God for your body working um it's it's something you know so basic but it's when it doesn't that that we're grateful so just reminding ourselves every day the basic things of of a functional body of of of our health of access to to water which um so many millions of people around the world do not have reliably is um very clarifying and super important yeah health is a gift water is a gift yeah is there a memory with your mom that had a defining effect on your uh life I have these vignettes in my mind you know seeing her in action in different capacities a lot of times um in the context of things that I would later go on to do myself so you I would go every day almost every day after school and I'd go to The Plaza Hotel and I'd follow her around as she'd walk the hallways and just observe her and she was So impossibly Glamorous she was doing everything and you know four and half inch heels with this bant and so it was almost it was almost like an it's almost like an inaccessible visual but I think for me when I saw her experience the most Joy tended to be by the Sea um almost always not not a pool and I think I get this from her I pools they're fine um I love the ocean I I love salt water I love the way it makes me feel and um and I think I got that from her so we would we would just swim together all all the time and and you know it's it's a lot of what I love about Miami actually being being so close to the ocean I find it to be super cathartic but a lot of my memories of my mom seeing her really like just in her Bliss um is is floating around in in in a body of salt water is there also some aspect to her being an example of somebody that could be sort of beautiful and feminine but at the same time uh powerful a successful businesswoman that showed that is possible to do that yeah I think she really was a Trailblazer it's not uncommon in in real estate for there to be multiple generations of uh of people and so on on job sites I it was not unusual for me to run into somebody whose grandfather had worked with my grandfather in Brooklyn or queens or whose father had um worked with my mother and and they'd always tell me these stories about her you know rolling in and they'd hear the heels first and and a lot of times the story would be like oh gosh like you know really it's two days after Christmas like we thought we'd get a reprieve um but she was uh she was very exacting um you know so I have this visual in my mind of her you know walking on rebar you know on the balls of her feet and these 4in shields I'm assuming she actually carried Flats with but but I don't know that's not the visual I have but she was um I loved the fact that she so embodied femininity and um and Glamour and um and was so comfortable being tough and ambitious and determined and um and this unbelievable businesswoman and entrepreneur at at a time when she was very much alone even you know for for me and in the development world and so many of the different businesses that I've been in there really aren't women outside of of sales and of marketing you don't see as many women in the development space in the construction space even in the architecture um and and design space um maybe outside of interior design so and she was you know decades ahead of me so it was I love hearing these stories I love I love hearing somebody who's my here tell me about their grandfather and their father and their experience with with one of my parents it's it's amazing and she did it all in for in heels and she did it she used to say there's nothing that I can't do better in heels that's a good that would be that would be your exact thing and when I complain about wearing something you know it was like the early 90s everything was also like uncomfortable these fabrics and materials and and I was I would like go back and forth between being super girly and a total tomboy um but uh but she'd you know dress me up in in these things and I'd be complaining about it and she' say ianka pain for beauty which I happen to totally disagree with because I think there's nothing worse than being uncomfortable so I haven't accepted or internalized all of um this this wisdom so to speak but um but but it was just funny you know she had she had a very specific point of view mhm this and full good lines paint for beauty it's it's funny because I mean just even in fashion if something's uncomfortable to me there's nothing that looks worse than when you see somebody like tottering around and like their heels hurt them so they're kind of walking oddly um and you know it doesn't they're not embodying their confidence in that regard so I'm like kind of the opposite I start with well I want to be comfortable um and that helps me be confident and um and in command a foundation for fashion for you is comfort and on top of that you build and it's Comfort like dowy you know there's that level of comfort but um functional Comfort but I think you have to for me I want to feel confident and you don't feel confident when you're like pulling at a garment or um you know hobbling on heels that don't fit you properly um and she was never doing those things either so I don't know how she was wearing stuff like that that's like a 40 lb be of dress and I know this because I have it and I wore it recently and I mean I got a work out walking to the elevator like this is a heavy dress and you know it was worth it it was great she's making it look easy though but she uh she makes it look very very easy so do you uh miss her I'm so much it's unbelievable how dislocating the loss of a of a parent is and um her mother lives with me still my grandmother who helped raise us so that's very special and I can ask her some of the questions that I would have sorry I wanted to ask my own mom but it's hard it was beautiful to see I've gotten a chance to spend time with your family to see so many generations together at the table and there's so much history there no she's 97 and um until uh she was around 94 she lived completely on her own no help no anything no support and um and now she requires really sort of 24-hour care and I I feel super grateful that I'm able to give her that because that's what she did for me it's amazing for me to have my children be able to grow up and and know her stories know her recipes um check dumplings and and goulash um and kit Lita and all the other things she used to make me in my childhood but but she really she was a major she was a major force in my life my grandmother she um you know my mom was working so you know my grandmother was the person who was always home every day when I came back from school and um I remember I used to shower and it would almost be like comical I I feel like in my memory and there is no washing machine I've seen on the planet that can actually do this but in my memory I'd go to shower you know and I'd drop something on the bed and I'd come back into the room after my shower and it was like folded pressed it was all my grandmother she like running after me um taking care of me um and uh so it's nice to be able to do that for her yeah I got from her reading my grandmother she would she devoured books like devoured books she loved the more Sensational ones so yeah so like some these like romance novels I would pick them up the covers but she could tell you she could look at like any Royal lineage across Europe and tell you all the Mistresses all all the drama all the drama she loved it um but her face was always buried in a book you know my grandfather dto he was the athlete um he was um he swam professionally for or you know on the national team for Czechoslovakia and he helped train my mom as I was saying before and skang so he was a great athlete and she was at home and she would read and cook and um and so that's that's something I I remember a lot from my childhood and she would always say like I got I got reading from her I mean like speaking of drama I had uh my English teacher in high school recommended a book for me by DH Lawrence it's supposed to be a classic she's like this is a classic you should read it's called Lady Shadow a lover and so I've read a lot of Classics but that one is straight up like a romance novel about a wife who like is cheating with a gardener and I remember reading this like what like in retrospect I understand why it's a classic because it was so scandalous to talk about sex in a book a 100 years ago whatever in retrospect do you know why she recommended it I have no I think maybe just sending a signal hey you need to get out more or something I don't know maybe maybe she was seeking to inspire you left yeah exactly um anyway I I mean I love that kind of stuff too but I love I love all the classics and they get they get there's a lot of drama human nature drama is part of it so what about your dad growing up what did you learn about life from your father I think my father's sense of humor is sometimes underappreciated uh so he had an amazing and has an amazing sense of humor he loved music I I think my my mom loved music as well but you know my father always used to say that in another life he would have been a Broadway musical producer which is hilarious to think about but he loves he loves music I that is funny to think about right he does now he DJs at marago so people get a sense of you know he loves Andrew Lloyd Weber and all of it pavara Elton John I mean these were the same songs on repeat my whole childhood so I know the playlist probably Sinatra and all that love Sinatra loves Elvis you know a lot of a lot of the greats so I think I got a a little bit of my love from music from from him but my mom shared that um as well I think um one of the things you know in in in looking back that I think I inherited for my father as well is this sort of um interest or understanding of the importance of asking question questions and specifically questions of the right people and I saw this a lot on on job sites so I remember uh with the old post office building there was this massive glass topped Atrium so Heating and Cooling the structure was like a Herculean lift um we had the mechanical engineers provide their thoughts on how we could do it efficiently and um and so that the temperature never varied and it was enormously expensive um uh as an as an undertaking and I remember one of his first times on on the site because you know he had really empowered me um with this project and he trusted me to to execute and to also you know rope him in when I needed it but one of the first time he visits we're walking the hallway and we're talking about how expensive this cooling system would be and heating system would be and he starts stopping and he's asking duct workers as as we walk talk what they think of the system that the mechanical engineers designed first few fine you know not great answers the third guy goes sir if you want me to be honest with you it's obscenely overdesigned in the circumstance of a 1,000-year storm you will have the exact P perfect temperature if there's a massive Blizzard or if it's unbearably hot but 99.9% of the time you'll never need it and um and so I think it's just an enormous waste of money and so we kept asking that guy questions and we ended up overhauling the design pretty well into the process of the whole system saving a lot of money creating a great system that's super functional and um so I learned a lot and that's just one example of countless that one really sticks out of my head because I'm like oh my gosh we're redesigning the whole system you know we were actively under construction so it was um but I see him do that on a lot of different issues he he would ask people on the work level what their thoughts were ideas Concepts designs and um there was almost like a Socratic sort of first principles type of way he he questioned people trying to get down to sort of trying to reduce complex things to something really fundamental and and and simple so I I I try to do that myself to the to the best I can and I think it's something I very much learned from him yeah I've seen great Engineers great leaders do just that you see you on do that a lot which is basically ask questions uh to push simplification can we do this simpler and like why the basic question is like why are we doing it this way can this be done simpler yeah and not taking as an answer that this is how we've always done it sort of not not allowing yourself like it doesn't matter that's how we always done it what is the right way to do it and what is and usually the simpler it is the more correct the way yeah has to do with cost has to do with Simplicity of uh of production manufacturer but usually simple is best and it's often times not the architect the engineers it's you know in elon's case probably the line worker who sees things yes more clearly so I think making sure it's not just that you're asking good questions you're asking the right people those same good questions that's why like uh a lot of the Elon companies are really flat in terms of uh organizational design where the the any anybody on the factory floor can talk directly to Elon there's no there's not there's not this managerial class this hierarchy where to travel up and down the hierarchy which large companies often construct this hierarchy of managers where no one manager if you ask them the question of like what have you done this week the answer is like it's really hard to come up with usually it's going to be a bunch of paperwork yeah uh so like nobody knows what they actually do so when it's flat you can actually get as quickly as possible when problems arise you you can you can solve those problems as quickly as possible and also you have a direct rapid iterative process where you're making things simpler making them more efficient and constantly improving so yeah it's it's interesting when when large I me you see this in government a lot of people get together a hierarchy is developed and that somehow sometimes it's good but very often just slows things down and you see great companies great great companies Apple Google meta they have to fight against that bureaucracy that builds the slowness that large organizations have and to still be a big organization and act like a startup is the Big Challenge it's super difficult to deconstruct that as well once it's in place right it's it's circumventing layers and asking questions probing questions of of people on the ground level um is a huge challenge to the authority of the hierarchy um and there's tremendous amount of resistance to it so it's how do you grow something in in the case of a company in terms of a culture that can scale um but doesn't lose its connection to um to sort of real and meaningful feedback it's it's not not easy I've uh had a lot of conversations with uh Jim Keller who's this legendary engineer and leader and he he has talked about like you often have to kind of be a little bit of an in the room uh not in a mean way but like it's uncomfortable yeah like a lot of these questions they're uncomfortable they break the kind of General politeness and civility that people have in communication when you get a meeting like nobody wants to be like uh can we do it way different everyone wants just just like this lunch is coming up you know I have I have this trip planned on the weekend with the family everyone just wants Comfort they get the when humans get together they kind of gravitate towards Comfort nobody wants that one person that comes in and says hey can we like do this way better and way different and everything we've gotten comfortable with throw it out not only do they not want that but the one person who comes in and does that puts a massive Target on their back and is ultimately seen as as a threat I mean nobody really gets fired for maintaining the status quo right even if things go poorly MH it's the way it was always done yeah humans are fascinating uh but in order to actually do great big projects yeah to to reach for the stars you have to have those people you have to you have you have to constantly disrupt and have those uncomfortable conversations and really have that first principles type of orientation especially in those large bureaucratic contexts so amongst many other things you created a fashion brand what was that about what was the origin of that I always loved fashion um as a form of self-expression as a means to to communicate either a truth or an illusion depending on what kind of mood you were in but um this like sort of second body if you will so I loved fashion and look I mean my mother was um a big part of the reason I did but I never thought I would go into fashion in fact I was graduating from Warden um it was the day of my graduation and Anna winter calls me up and um and offered me a job at Vogue which is a dream in so many ways but I was so focused I I wanted to go into real estate and I wanted to build buildings and um and I and I told her that so I I really thought that that was going to be the path I was taking and then very organically fashion you know it was part of my life but it came it came into my life in a in a more professional capacity um by talking with my first of of many different partners that I had in the fashion space about he he actually had shed me a building um to buy his family had some real estate holdings and and I passed on on the real estate deal but we forged a friendship and we started talking about how in the space that he was in Fine Jewelry there was this lack of product and brands that were positioned for self- purchasing females so everything was about you know the man buying the Christmas gift the man buying the engagement ring the stores felt like that they were tailored towards the male aesthetic the marketing felt like that and and what about the woman who had a salary and was really excited to buy herself a great pair of earrings or um or had just received a great bonus and and was going to use it to to treat herself so we thought there was a void in the marketplace and um and that was the first category I launched ianka Trump jewelry and we just caught lightning in a bottle it was really quickly after that I met my partner had founded Nine West shoes really capable partner and we launched um a shoe collection which which took off and uh did enormously well and then a clothing collection and Handbags and sunglasses and fragrance so so we caught a moment and um and we found a positioning for this for the self- purchasing multi-dimensional woman and we made dressing for work aspiration at the time we launched if you wanted to buy something for an office context like the brands that existed were the opposite of exciting like nobody was you know taking pictures of like what they were wearing to work and um and and posting it on lines with some of these classic Legacy Brands really it felt very much like it was designed by a team of men for what a woman would want to wear to the office so we started creating this clothing that was feminine that was beautiful that was versatile that would take a woman from uh the boardroom to an after school soccer game to um a date night with a boyfriend to uh to a walk in the park with her husband like all the the different ways women live their lives and creating a wardrobe for that woman who works at every aspect of their life not just sort of the siloed professional part and and it was it was really compelling we started creating great brand content and we had incredible um contributors like Adam Grant who was um who was blogging for us at the time and and creating aspirational content for for working women it was actually kind of a funny story but I now had probably close to 11 different product categories and we were growing like wildfire and I started to think about what would be a compelling way to sort of create interesting content for the people who are buying these um these different C categories and and we came up with a website called women who work and I went to a marketing agency you know one of the fancy firms in New York and I said you know we want to create a brand campaign around this multi-dimensional woman who works and um and what do you think like can you help us and they come back and they say you know we don't like the word work we think it should be women who do and I just start laughing because I'm like women who do and the fact that they couldn't conceive it being sort of exciting and aspirational and interesting um to sort of lean into to working at at all aspects of Our Lives was just fascinating to me but showed that that was part of the problem and and I think that's why ultimately I mean when the business grew to be hundreds of millions of dollars in in sales we were distributed at all the best retailers across the country from you know Neiman Marcus to Sachs to um to Bloomingdales and Beyond and and I think we it really resonated with people in an amazing way and and probably not dissimilar to how I have this incredible experience every time somebody comes up to me and tells me that um that they were married in a space that I had painstakingly designed I have that experience now with with my fashion company the number of women who will come up tell me that they they loved my shoes or they loved the Handbags and I've had women show me their engagement rings they got engaged with us and um it's really rewarding it's really beautiful yeah when I was hanging out with you in Miami the number of women they came up to you say they love the the clothing they love the shoes is awesome all all these years later all these years later what does it take to make a shoe where somebody would come up to you years later and just be just full of love for this thing you've created what what's that mean like what does it take to do that well I still wear the shoes so I mean that's a good starting point right to create a thing that you want to wear I feel like the the product I think first and foremost you have to have the the right partner so shoe building a shoe if you talk to a great shoe designer it's like it's architecture like making a heel that's 4 in that feels good to walk in for eight hours a day that is an engineering feet and uh so I found great Partners in everything that I did my my shoe partner um had founded 9 West so he really knew what went into making a shoe wearable and comfortable and then you overlay that with great design and uh and we also created this really comfortable beautifully designed super feminine um product offering that was also affordably priced so I think it was like the trifecta of those of those three things that that made that I think it made it stand out for so many people can you speak to I don't know if it's Al to articulate but can you speak to the process you go through from idea to the final thing like what you go through to bring an idea to life so not being a designer and this is true in real estate as well I was never the architect so I didn't necessarily have the pen and in in fashion the same I was kind of like a conductor I was I knew what I liked and didn't like and I think that's really important and that became honed for me over time so I would have to sit a lot longer with something earlier on than later when I had more refined my aesthetic point of view and so I think first of all you have to have a pretty strong sense of um of what resonates with you and and then as in the case of of my fashion business as it grew and became um quite a large business and I had so many different categories everything had to work together so I had individual partners for each category but if we were selling at nean Marcus we couldn't have a pair of shoes that didn't relate to a dress that didn't relate to a pair of sunglasses and hand bags all on the same floor so you know in the beginning it was much more collaborative um as time passed I I really sort of took the point on deciding and this is the aesthetic for the season these are the colors we're going to use these are fabrics and then working with our partners on the execution of that but I I needed to create an overlay that allowed for cohesion as the collection grew and and that was actually really fun for me because I was a little different you know I was typically initially responding to things that were put in front of me and towards the end I was it was my partners who were responding to the things that myself and my team but it's still it's you know I would always I always wanted to bring the best talent in so I was I was hiring great designers and print makers and um and copywriters and so I had this you know almost like that conductor analogy I had this incredible group of in this case women assembled who who had very strong points of view um themselves and and it created an a great team so yeah I mean great team is really sort of essential it's it's it's the essential thing behind any successful story but there's this thing of taste which is really interesting cuz it's hard to kind of articulate what it takes but basically knowing a versus B what looks good or without AB comparison to say like if we did if we change this part that would make it better that sort of designer taste it's hard to make explicit what that is but the great designers like have that taste like this is going to look good and it's not actually again the Steve Jobs thing is not the opinion like you can't uh pull people and ask them what looks better it's you you have to have the vision of that yeah and as you said you also have to develop eventually the confidence that your taste is is good such that you can like curate you can direct teams you can argue that no no no this is right even when there's several people that say this doesn't make any sense if you have that Vision have the confidence this will look good that's how you come up with great designs it's it's a mix mixture of great taste as you develop over time and the confidence and and that's a really hard thing especially and I think one of the things I love most about all of these creative Pursuits is that ability to to work with the best people right now I'm um working with my husband we have this 1400 acre island in the Mediterranean and we're building bringing in the best Architects and the Best Brands and but to have a point of view and to challenge people who are such artists respectfully um but not to be afraid to to ask questions it takes a lot of confidence to do that um and and it's hard so these are actually just internal early renderings so we're in the process of doing the master planning now but this is beautiful I mean it's early Vision yeah it's going to be extraordinary Aman's going to operate the hotel for us and there are going to be Villas and uh we we have Carbone who's going to be doing the food and beverage and but it's it's amazing to bring together all of this talent and for me to be able to play around and flex the the real estate muscles again and and have some fun with it is real estate the design the the art how hard is it to bring something like that to life CU that's like that looks surreal out of this world well especially on an island it's it's challenging meaning the logistics and even getting the building materials to an island or no joke but um but we will execute on it so and it it may not be this this is sort of as I said early conceptual drawings but it gives a sense of sort of wanting to honor the topography that exists and um you know this is obviously very modern but um making it feel right in terms of the context of um of the vegetation and uh and the trrain that exists is and not just have you know a beautiful glass box obvious you want glass you want to look out and see that gorgeous blue ocean but um but how do you do that in a way that doesn't feel generic and isn't a squandered opportunity to create something new yeah and it's integrated with a natural landscape it's it's a celebration of the natural landscape around it so I guess you start from this dream like because this feels like a dream and then when you're faced with the reality of the building materials and all the actual constraints of the building that it evolves from there right yeah and so much I mean so much of architecture you don't see um but it's decisions made so how do you how do you create independent structures where you look out of one and don't see the other you know how do you ensure the sort of the stacking um and the master plan works in a way that's harmonious and view corridors and all of those elements all of those components of decision making are super appreciated but not often thought about what's a view corridor like to make sure that the top unit you're not looking out and seeing a whole bunch of units you're looking out and seeing the ocean so that's where you take this and then you start angling everything and you start thinking about well in this context do we have green roofs so if there's any hint of a roof it's camouflaged by vegetation that matches what already exists on the island where the engineers become very important well yeah so how do you build into a mountain side um while being sensitive to to Beauty and of the island it's almost like a mathematical problem I took a class computational geometry in grad school where you have to think about these view corridors it's like a math problem yeah well but it's also an art problem because it's not just about making sure that there's no occlusions to the view you have to figure out when there is occlusions like what is a vegetation is it you have to figure all that out and there's probably so every single every single room every single building is a is a thing that has extra complexity and then the choic is like how does the sunrise and set yeah so how do you want to angle the hotel in relation awesome to the sunrise and the sunset you you obviously want people to experience those um so which do you favor uh the directionality of the wind and on on an island and you know in this case the winds coming from the North and the vegetation is less Lush on the Northern end so do you focus more on the sou southern end and have you know the horseback riding trails and amenities up towards the the north so there are these really interesting decisions and and choices you get to reflect on that's a fascinating sort of discussion to be having and probably there's like actual constraints and like infrastructure issues so all those the grade of the land right if it's super steep so also finding the areas of topography that are flatter but still have the great views so it's it's fun it's I think real estate and building it's like a giant puzzle and I love puzzles every piece relates to another and it's all sort of interconnected yeah like you said in the Old Post Office like the every single room is different so every single room is a puzzle when you're doing the renovation yeah that's fascinating and if you're not thoughtful it gets like at best really quirky at worst completely ridiculous Quirk is such a funny word it's such a like youve walked into I'm sure you've wed walked into your fair share of like quirky rooms you know and sometimes like that's Charming but most often it's Charming when it's intentional yeah through like smart design yeah you can tell if it's by accident or if it's intentional you could you could tell so much I mean the whole Hospitality thing it's not just like how it's designed it's how once the thing is operating if it's a hotel like how everything comes together yeah the the culture of the place and the warmth yeah like I think with spaces they you can feel like the so of a structure and I think on the hotel side you have to think about like flow of traffic use all these things when you're building condominiums or or your own home you want to think about like the warmth of a space as well and especially with super modern design sometimes like warmth is sacrificed and I think there is a way to sort of marry both and and that's where you get into sort of the Interior Design Elements and disciplines and how Fabrics can create tremendous warmth in a space which is otherwise sort of Colder raw building materials and that's a really interesting like how texture matters how color matters and I think often times interior design is not it doesn't take the same priority and I think the I think that underestimates the impact can have on how you experience a a room or a space yeah especially when it's working together with a with the architecture yeah yeah fabrics and color that's so interesting finishes you know the choice of wood that's making me feel horrible about the space we're sitting in it's like black curtains the warmth I need to work on this this is a big two this is a big twoo item you're making me I'll listen back to this over and over maybe like a woman's touch needed a lot a lot I actually I appreciate the vegetation yeah fake plants you know what I love about this space though is it's is like you come through like every single element there's a story behind it so it's not just some you didn't have some interior designer curate your bookshelf you know like nobody came in here with books by the yard this is basically an Ikea uh like this is not this is not deeply thought through but it it does bring me joy yeah uh which is one way to do design as long as you're happy that usually means if your taste is decent enough that means others will be happy or we'll see the joy radiate through it but I appreciate you were grasping for compliments and you eventually got that no I actually I love it I love it you have like a little I love this guy there's yeah you're holding on to to a monkey looking at a at at a human skull which is particularly irrelevant and this I mean I feel like you've really thought about all of these things yeah there there's robot I don't know I mean I don't know how much you've looked into robots but there's there's a way to communicate love and affection from a robot that I'm really fascinated by and a lot of cartoonists do this too you have to when you create cartoons and non-human likee entities you have to bring out the joy so with Wall-E or um robots and um and Star Wars to be able to communicate emotion to anger and excitement thr a robot is really interesting to me and people that do it successfully uh are awesome are awesome make you smile yeah that makes me smile for sure there's a longing there how do you do that successfully as you as you bring them your projects to life I think uh there's there's so many detailed elements that I think artists know well uh but one basic one is something that people people know and you now know cuz you have a a dog um is the excitement that a dog has when it when you first show up just the recognizing you and like catching your eye and just showing its excitement by wiggling his butt and tail and all this kind of this this uh intense joy that overtakes his body that that moment of recognizing something yeah it's the double take that you you're that that moment of like where this Joy of recognition takes over your whole cognition and you're just like uh there and there's a connection and then the other person gets excited you both get excited together um it's kind of like that feeling um what would I put it you know like when you go to airports and you get to see people uh who haven't seen each other for a long time all of a sudden recognize each other in their meeting and they're all like run towards each other and the hug that moment uh by way that's awesome to watch there so much joy and and dogs though will have that every time you could walk into the other room to get a glass of milk and you come back and your dog sees you like it's the first time so I love replicating that in robots they actually say children like one of the reasons why peekaboo is so successful is that they actually don't remember not having seen you a few seconds prior um there's a there's a term for it but I remember as um when when my kids were younger you leave the room and you walk back in 30 seconds later and they experience the same joy as if you had been you know gone for four hours and uh we grw out of that we become very used to one another I kind of want to forever be excited by the peekaboo phenomena the simple Joys we're talking about on fashion having the confidence of taste to be able to sort of push through on this idea of design but you've also mentioned um somebody you admires Rick Ruben in his book The creative act it has some really interesting ideas and one of them is to accept uh self-doubt and imperfection so is there some battle within yourself that you have on sort of um striving for Perfection and for the confidence and always kind of having it together versus like accepting that things are always going to be imperfect I think every day I think I wake up in the morning and you know I want to be better I want to be a better mom I want to be a better wife I want to be more creative I want to be physically stronger and um and so that very much lives within me all the time you know I think I I also grew up in the context of being the child of two extraordinarily successful parents and that could have been debilitating for me and I saw that and a lot of my friends who grew up in circumstances similar to that they were afraid to try for fear of of not measuring up and I think somehow early on I learned to kind of harness the fear of not being good enough not being confident enough um and I harnessed it to make me better um and and to push me outside of my comfort zone so I think that's always lived with me and and and I think it probably always will I think you have to have humility in anything you do that you could be better and and strive for that I think as you get older it it softens a little bit as you have more reps you know as you have more examples of of having been thrown in the deep end um and figure it out how to swim you you get a little bit more com com fortable in your sort of abstract competency but if that fear is not in you I think you're not challenging yourself enough harness the fear um the other thing he writes about is um intuition that you need to trust your instincts and intuition uh that's a very recrent thing to say but so what percent of your decision making is intuition and what percent is through rigorous careful analysis would you say it's both it's like trust but verify you know I think you I think that's also where um age and experience comes into play because I think you always have sort of a gut instinct but I think intuition like well-honed intuition comes from a place of of accumulated knowledge right so often times when you feel really strongly about something it's because you've sort of you've been there like you know what's right um or on a personal level if you're acting in accordance with your core values you know it just feels good and even if it would be the right decision for others if you're acting outside of of of your sort of Integrity or core values it doesn't feel good and and it you know your intuition um will signal that to you you'll never be you'll never be comfortable so I think because because of that I I start oftentimes with my intuition and then I and then I put it through like a rigorous test of of whether that is in fact true um but very seldom do I go against what my initial Instinct was not at least at this point in my life yeah I had actually a discussion yesterday with a big- Time Business uh owner investor who who's talking about being impulsive and following that like on a phone call shifting like the entire everything like giving away a very large amounts of money and moving it in another Direction on an Impulse making a promise that he can't at that time deliver but knows if he works hard he'll deliver and all doing just be following that impulsive feeling and he said now that you know he has has a family that probably some of that impulse is quieted down a little bit he's more rational and thoughtful and so on but wonders whether it's sometimes good to just be impulsive and to just trust your gut and Just Go With It Don't deliberate too long because then you won't you won't do it it's interesting it's the confidence the stupidity maybe of Youth that leads to some of the greatest breakthroughs and it's like there's a cost to wisdom and deliberation there there is but I I actually think in this case as you get older you may act less impulsively but I think you're more like attuned with um you have more experience so you're your gut is like more well honed you know so your instincts are more well honed I think [Music] um I I found that to be true for me you know it doesn't feel as like Reckless as when I was younger uh amongst many other things you were on The Apprentice people love you on there people love the show so what did you learn about business about life from the uh various contestants on there well I think you can learn everything about life from show rers so I'm just I'm got it that one human amazing um but you know I it was it was such a wild experience for me because I was I was quite young um when I was on it just getting started in business and it was the number one television show in the country and it went on to be syndicated all over the world and it was just this wild like phenomenal success you know a business show had never um had never crossed over in this sort of way so it was really a moment in time and um you had regular apprentice and then the Celebrity Apprentice but but the tasks I mean they they went on to be studied at Business Schools across the country so like every other week I'd be reading case studies of how The Apprentice was being examined and um taught to class is in this University in Boston or you know so it was extraordinary and and this was like a real life classroom I was in so I think because of the nature of the show you learn a lot about you know teamwork um and you're watching it and analyzing it real time you learned a lot about um a lot of the tasks were very marketing oriented um because of you know the short duration of time they had to to execute um a lot of um you learned a lot about time management because of that short duration so you know almost every episode would devolve into people hysterical over the fact that they had 10 minutes left to um with this Herculean lift ahead of them so so it was it was a fascinating it was a fascinating experience for me and and we would be filming I mean we would film first thing in the morning at like 5 or 6: a.m. in Trump Tower often times like in the lobby of Trump Tower that's where the war rooms um and boardrooms of the candidates were the contestants were um and then we would go up in the elevator to our office we would work all day and then we'd come down and we'd evaluate the task it was this weird like real life television thing experience um in the middle of our sort of on the book ends of our workday um so it was it was intense um so you're you're like curating the television version of it and also living it living the and often times there was like an overlay like there were episodes that they came up with brand campaigns for my shoe collection or my clothing line um or um or design challenges related to you know a hotel I was responsible for for building so there was this unbelievable crossover that was obviously great for us from a business perspective but um it's sometimes surreal to to experience what was it like was it was it scary to be in front of a camera when you know so many people watch I mean that that's a new experience for you at that time just the number of people watching yeah was that weird it was really weird I I really struggled watching myself on the episodes like I really I still to this day like television as a medium like the fact that we're taping this yeah I'm more self-conscious than if we weren't I I just it's um hey I have to watch myself as after after we record this before I publish it I have to listen to my stupid selft talk so and so you're saying it doesn't get better it doesn't get better I I still I hear myself I'm like does my voice really sound like that um you know why do I do this thing or that thing and I I find it some people are super at ease and and who knows maybe they're not I but some people feel like they're SEC you know my father was I think like who you who you saw as who you get and I think that made him so effective um in that Medium uh because he was just himself and he was totally unselfconscious I was not I was totally self-conscious so it was uh it was extraordinary but um but also a little challenging for me I think certain people are just like Born to Be entertainers like Elvis like on stages that come to life yeah this is where they this is where they're truly happy I've met I've met guys like that like great rock stars like this is where they they feel like they belong on stages it's not just a thing they do and they there's certain aspects they love certain aspects they don't and know this is where this is where they're alive this is where they they've always dreamed of being this is where they want to be forever Michael Jackson was like that Michael Jackson I saw pictures of you hanging out with Michael Jackson that was cool he came once to a performance I wanted to be one moment in time I wanted to be a professional ballerina okay yeah um and I was you know working really hard I was going to the school of American Ballet I was dancing at the Lincoln Center in the Nutcracker I was super serious you know nine 10-year-old and um and my parents came to a Christmas performance of The Nutcracker and my father brought Michael Jackson with him and everyone so excited that all the dancers they wore one glove but I remember he was so shy he was so quiet um when you'd see him uh like in in smaller group settings and then you'd watch him walk on to stage and it was like a completely different person like the Vitality that came into him and you say that's like someone who was born to do what he did and and I think there are a lot of performers like that and I just in general love to see people that have found the thing that uh makes them come alive yeah like I um as I mentioned went to the Jungle recently with Paul rosley and he's a guy who just belongs in the jungle yeah like that's a guy where like when I I got a chance to go with him from the city to the jungle and you just see this person change of the happiness the the the joy he has when he first is able to uh jump in the water of the Amazon River and to feel like he's home with the crocodiles and all that with he's calling friends and probably dances around in the trees with the monkeys so he like he this is this is where he belongs and I love seeing that you felt that I mean I I watched the interview you did with him and and he felt that like you his passion and enthusiasm like radiated and cap I mean I'm I love animals like I love all animals never L Snak so much and he almost made me now I appreciate the beauty of them much more than I did um prior to listening to him speak about them but it it's an infectious thing he actually we were talking about skyscrapers before I loved he called trees skyscrapers of life and I thought that was so great yeah and they are they're so big I mean just like skyscrapers or large buildings they also represent a history especially in Europe I like to think look at all these ancient buildings you like to think of all the people throughout history that have looked at them have admired them have been inspired by them you know great leaders of history in France it's like Napoleon just the history that's contained within a building you almost feel the energy of that history you could feel the stories emanate from the buildings and that same way when you look at Giant trees that have been there uh for for decades for centuries in some cases you you feel the history the stories I'm inate I got a chance to climb some of them so you feel like there's a visceral feeling of the power of the trees it's cool yeah that's an experience I'd love to have be that disconnected yeah being in the jungle uh among the trees among the animals you remember that you're forever a part of nature you're you're fundamentally our nature that this is a uh Earth is a living organism and you're a part of that organism and that's humbling that's beautiful and you get to experience that in a real real way it sounds simple to say but when you actually like experience it it stays with you for a long time especially if you're out there alone like I got a chance to spend time in the jungle solo just by myself and you sit in the fear of that in the Simplicity of that all of it and just no sounds of humans anywhere yeah you're just sitting there and listening to uh all the monkeys and the birds trying to have sex with each other all around you just screaming and there's like romant I mean I romanticize everything there's like birds that are monogamous for life like Ma you could see like two of them flying they're also by the way screaming at each other I always wonder like are they argu arguing or is this their love language like that's very fun you just have these like two birds that you know have been together for a long time and they're just screaming at each other in the morning that's really funny because there aren't that many animal species that are monogamous and you highlighted one example but they literally sound like just they're bickering but maybe if to them it's beautiful you know I don't want to judge but they do sound very loud and very obnoxious um but amidst all of that it's just I don't know I think it's so humbling to like feel so small too like I feel like when we get busy and when we're running around it's easy to feel we're so in our head and we feel sort of so consequential like in the context of even our own lives and then you find yourself in a situation like that and it's I think you feel so much more connected knowing how minuscule you are in the broader sense and I feel that way when I'm on the ocean on a surfboard um you know you just it's it's really humbling to be so small amidst that vast sea and it feels um it feels really beautiful you know with no noise no chatter no distractions just um just being in the moment and it sounds like you experienced that in a very very real way and in the Amazon yeah the power of the waves is cool I love swimming out into the ocean and feeling the power of the ocean you you just like this Speck and you can't fight it right you just have to sort of be in it and I think in surfing one of the things I love about it is feel like a lot of water sports are like manipulating the environment you know um and there's something that can be a little like violent about it like you look at wind surfing and um whereas with surfing you're like in harmony with it so um you're not fighting it you're you're flowing with it and you still have like the agency of choosing which waves you're going to surf and um you sit there and you you read the ocean and and and you learn to understand it but you can't control it what's it like to like like fall in your face when you're trying to Surf like what I haven't surfed before it just feels like I always see videos of when everything goes great I just wonder like when it doesn't those are the ones people post no um well I actually had the unque experience of one of my first time surfing I only learned a couple of years ago so I'm not good I just love it I love everything about it I love the physicality I love being in the ocean I love the everything about it the hardest thing with surfing is paddling out because when you're like committing you catch a wave obviously sometimes like you know you flip over your board and that doesn't feel great but when you're in sort of the line of impact and you've maybe surfed a good wave in and now you're going out for another set and you get sort of stuck in that impact line there's like nothing you can do you just sort of sit there and you try to dive underneath it and it will pound you and pound you so I've been stuck there while you know four five six waves just like crash on top of your head and and the worst thing you can do is get reactive and you know um and scared and and try and fight against it you kind of just have to flow with it until inevitably there's a break and then paddle like hell back out to the line um to the beach whatever you know whatever you're feeling but it's that's to me that's the hardest part um the paddling out how did life change when your father decided to run for presid Wow everything changed you know almost almost overnight we learned that he was planning to announce his candidacy two weeks before he actually did and nothing about our lives had been constructed with politics in mind you know I most often when people are exposed to politics at that level that sort of national level there's first like city council run and then maybe a state level run and um and maybe maybe uh you know Congress senator um ultimately the presidency so it was unheard of to for him never to have run a campaign and then run for president and and win so it was [Music] um it was an extraordinary experience there there was so much intensity and so much scrutiny and um and and so much noise so that took for sure like a moment to acclimate too not sure I ever fully acclimated but it it definitely was um was a super un usual experience but I think then the the process that unfolded over over the next couple of years was also like the most extraordinary growth experience of my life you know suddenly I was going into communities that I probably never would have been to and I was talking with people who in 30 seconds would reveal to me their deepest insecurity their gravest Fe their wildest Ambitions all of it with the hope that in telling me that story it would get back to a potential future president of the United States and have impacts for their family for their community so the level of cander and vulnerability people have with you is UN like anything I've ever experienced and I done The Apprentice before people may know um who I was in some of these situations that I was going into too but they wouldn't have shared with me these things that you got the impression that often times their own spouses wouldn't know and they wouldn't do so within 30 seconds so you learn so much about what motivates people what drives people what their concerns are and you grow so much as a result of it so when you're in the White House people unlike in any other position people have a sense that All the Troubles they're going through maybe you can help yeah so they put it all out there and and and they do so in such a raw vulnerable and real way it's it's shocking and eye openening and um and super motivating I I remember once I was in New Hampshire and um early on right after my father had had announced his candidacy and man walks up to me in in the greeting line and within around 5 seconds he had started to tell me a story about how his daughter had died of an overdose um and how he was worried his son was also addicted to opioids his daughter's friends his son's friends and and it's heartbreaking it's it's heartbreaking and it's it's something that I would experience every day in talking with people and those stories just stay with you always you know I I uh took a long road trip around the United States in my 20s and I'm kind of thinking of doing it again just just for like a couple of months for that exact purpose and you can get these stories when you go to like a bar in the middle of nowhere and just sit and talk to people and they start sharing and it's it's it reminds you like how beautiful the country is it reminds you several things one that people well it shows you that there's a lot of different accents that's for one uh but aside from that that people are struggling with all the same stuff yeah and um at least at that time I wonder what it is now but at that time I don't remember on the surface there's like political divisions there's uh Republicans and Democrats and so on but like underneath it there people are all the same the concerns are all the same there's not that much of a division right now the the surface division has been Amplified even more maybe because of social media I don't know why uh so I would love to see what the country is like now but I suspect probably it's still not as divided as it appears to be on the surface what the media shows with the social media shows um but what did you experience in terms of the The Division I think a couple reactions to what you just said I think the first is you're when you connect with people like that you are so um inspired by their courage you know in the face of adversity and um their resilience and it's like a truly remarkable experience for me the campaign lifted me out of a bubble I didn't even know I was in you know I I grew up on the Upper East Side of New York and I felt like I was well traveled and well educated and I believe that I believed at the time that I'd been exposed to Divergent viewpoints and I realized during the campaign how limited my exposure had been relative to what it was becoming so there was a lot of there was a lot of growth in that as well but I do think you know you think about the vital and politics and um you know whether it's worse than it's been in the past or not I think that's Up For Debate I think you know there have been few there have been duels there screaming and there's you know politics has always been a blood sport and it's always been incredibly vicious I think in the toxic swirl of social media it's more Amplified and um there are there's more sort of democratization around participating in it perhaps um and it seems like the voices are louder but it's always been it feels like it's always been that um but I don't believe most people are like that and and you know you meet people along the way and they're not leading with what their politics are you know they're they're telling you about their hopes for themselves and their communities and uh and it makes you feel that we are a whole lot less divided than um you know the media and uh others would have us believe although I have to say having duels sounds pretty cool maybe I just romanticize Westerns anyway all right I miss cleanwood movies okay but it's true like you read some of the stuff like in terms of what politics used to be in the history of the United States those those folks went pretty rough like way rougher actually but they didn't have social media so they had to go like real hard and the media was rough too so all like the the fake news all of that that's not recent it's it's been non-stop you know I look at the surface division the surface bickering and might be like just a feature of democracy that's it's not a bug of democracy it's a feature we're in a constant conflict and it's the way we resolve we try to figure out the right way forward so in the moment it feels like people are just tearing each other apart but really we're trying to find a way where like in the long Arc of History it will look like progress but in the short term it just sounds like people making stories up about each other and calling each other names and all this kind of stuff but in the there's a purpose to it I mean that's what Freedom looks like I guess is what I'm trying to say and is better than the alternative well I I think that the vast majority of people aren't participating in it sure yes that's true also you know I think there's a minority of people that are doing most of the yelling and screaming yeah and the majority of Americans just want to send their kid to a great school and want their communities to thrive and um want to be able to real Iz their their dreams and aspirations so I saw a lot more of that than it would feel obvious if you looked at like a Twitter feed what went into your decision to join the White House as an adviser you know the campaign I never I never thought about joining it was kind of like get to the end of it and when it started I was like everything in my life was almost firing on all cylinders I had two young kids at home during the course of the campaign I ended up um I was pregnant with my third so um this young family my businesses real estate and and fashion and um working alongside my brothers running the Trump Hotel Collection and we had so many my life was full and busy and um and so there was a big part of me that was just wanted to get through just get through it um without really thinking forward to what the implications were for me um but when my father won he asked Jared and I to join him and in asking that question you know keep in mind he was a total Outsider so there was no bench of people um as he would have today he had never spent the night in Washington DC before yeah staying in the White House and so when he asked us to join him he trusted us he trusted in our ability to to execute and there wasn't a part of me that could imagine the 70 or 80y old version of myself looking back and having been okay with having said no and going back to my life as I knew it before I mean in retrospect I realize there is no life as you know it before you know um but but just the idea of of of not saying yes um wherever that would lead me and um and so I I dove in you know I was also during the course of the campaign I was just much more sensitive to the problems and experiences of Americans I I gave you an example before of of the the father in New Hampshire but but even just in my consumption of information I you know I had a a business um that was predominantly young women you know many of which were thinking about having a kid had just had a child um were were planning on on that life event and I knew what they needed to be able to show up every day and and realize this dream for themselves and and the support structures they would need to have in place and I remember reading this article um at the time in uh one of the major newspapers of of a woman she had had a very solid job working at one of the blue chip um accounting firms and the recession came she lost her job around the same time as her partner left her and over a matter of months she lost her home so she wound up with her two young kids after bouncing around between neighbors living in their car she gets a call back from one of the many interviews had done for a second interview where she was all but guaranteed the job should that go well and she had arranged child care for her two young children with with a neighbor um in her old apartment block and the morning of the interview she shows up and the neighbor doesn't answer the doorbell and she stands her 5 10 minutes doesn't answer so she has a choice does she go to the interview with her children or does she try to to cancel she gets in her car drives to the interview leaves her two children in the backseat of the car with the window cracked goes into the interview and gets pulled out of the interview by police because somebody had call the cops after seeing her her children in the backseat of the car she gets thrown in jail her kids get taken from her and she spends years fighting to regain custody and I think about that's an extreme example but I think about something like that and I say if I was the mother and we were homeless like would I gone to that interview and I I probably would have and that is not like an acceptable situation you know so you you hear stories like that and then you get asked will you come with me and it's really hard to say no you know I spent four years in Washington I feel like I left it all in the field I feel really good about it and um and I'm I feel really privileged to have been able to do what I did I chance to help to help many people saying no means uh you're kind of turning away from those people you felt like that to me yeah yeah but then it's the turmoil of politics that you're getting into and it really is a leap into the abyss um what was it like trying to get stuff done in Washington in this um place where politics is a game uh it feels that way maybe from an outsider perspective and you go in there trying given some of those stories trying to help people what's it like to get anything done it's an incredible cognitive lift that's a nice way to put it yeah to to get things done you know there are a lot of people who would prefer to cling to the problem and their talking points about how they're going to solve it rather than sort of roll up their sleeves and do the work it takes to build coalitions of support and find people who are willing to compromise and move the ball and so it's extremely difficult and you know Jared and I talk about all the time it it probably should be because these are highly cons quential policies that impact people's lives at scale shouldn't be so easy to do them and they are doable but it's challenging you know one of the first experiences I had where it really was just a full grind effort was um with tax cuts and and the work I did to um get the child tax credit doubled as part of it and it just meant meeting after meeting after meeting after meeting with lawmaker convincing them of why this is good policy um going into their districts campaigning in their districts helping them convince their constituents of of why it's important of why child care support is important of why Paid Family Leave is important um of different policies that impact working American families so it's um it's hard but it's uh it's it's really rewarding and then to get it done I mean just the child tax credit alone 40 million American families got an average of $22,200 each year as a result of the doubling of the child tax credits that's one component of tax cuts when I was like researching this stuff you just get to think the scale of things the scale of impact is 40 million families each one of those is a story is a story of struggle of trying to give a large part of your life to a job while still being able to give love and support and care to family to kids and to manage all of that each one of those is a little puzzle that they have to solve and it's a life and death puzzle it's a uh you can lose your your home your security you can lose your job uh you can scoot stuff up with parenting so you can mess all that up and you're trying to hold it together and government policies can help make that easier or can some cases make that possible and you get to do that a scale not of like five or 10 families but like 40 million families and that's just one thing yeah the people who shared with me their experience and you know during the campaign it was what they hoped to see happen once you were in there it was what they were seeing what they were experiencing the result of the policies and and that was that was the fuel you know on the hardest days like that was the fuel child tax credit I remember visiting with a woman Britney Houseman she came to the White House and she had two small children she was pregnant with her third her husband was killed in a car accident she was in school at the time her dream was to become criminal justice Advocate that was no longer on the table for her after he passed away and she became the so earner and provider for her family and she couldn't afford child care she couldn't afford to stay in school so she ended up creating a Child Care Center in her home and her Center was so successful because in part of different policies we worked on including the child care block rants that went to to the state she ended up opening additional centers I visited her one of them in Colorado now she has like a huge focus on helping teenage moms who don't have the resources to afford quality child care for their kids um come into her centers and programs and you know it's stories like that of the hardships people face but also what they do with opportunity when they're given it um that really like Powers you through tough moments when you're in Washington what can you say about the process of like bringing that to life so uh the child tax credits so doubling them from a th000 2,000 per child well like what are the challenges of that and getting people to compromise I'm sure there's a lot of politicians playing games with that because maybe it's a republican that came up with an idea or a Democrat that came up with an idea and so they don't want to give credit to the idea and there's probably all kinds of games happening where they when the game is happening you probably forget about the families each politician thinks about how they can benefit themselves you forget like the serving part of the role you're supposed to be in there were definitely people I met with in Washington who I felt that was true of but you know they all go back to their districts and I assume that they all have similar experiences to what I had where people share their stories so there'd be something really cynical about thinking they forget but you know some do you helped get people together what's that take trying to get people to compromise trying to get people to see the common Humanity well I think first and foremost you have to be willing to talk with them so you know one of the policies I advocated for was Paid Family lead we left and 9 million more Americans had it through a combination of securing it for our federal Workforce I I had people in the White House who were pregnant who didn't have access to to paid leave so we want to keep people attached to the workforce yet when they have an important life event like a child um we create an impossibility for that you know some people don't even have access to to unpaid leave um if they're part-time workers and so that and um and then we also put in place the first ever national tax credit for workers making under $72,000 a year where employers could then offer it to their workers that was also part of tax cuts so you know part of it is is really taking taking the arguments as to why this is good smart well-designed policy to people and you know it was one of my big surprises that um on certain policy issues that I thought would have been well socialized the policies that existed were never shared across the aisle so people just lived with them maybe in hopes that one day they would have the votes to get exactly what they want but I was surprised by how little discussion there was so so I think part of it is be willing to have those tough discussions with people who may not share your Viewpoint and be an active listener when they point out flaws and they have suggestions for for changes um not believing that you have a monopoly on good ideas and and I think there has to be a lot of humility in in architecting these things and um and a policy should benefit from that type of well-rounded input yeah be able to see like you said well-designed policies there's probably like the details are important too like there's just just like with architecture and you walk the rooms there's probably really good designs of policies economic policy that helps families that delivers the maximum amount of uh money or resources to families that needed and is not a waste of money so like that there's a probably really nice designs there nice ideas that are bipartisan that has nothing to do with politics has to do with just great Economic Policy it's great policies and that requires listening requires Trust too like I learned tax cuts was really interesting for me because I met with so many people across the political Spectrum on advancing that policy I really figured out who was willing to deviate from their talking points when the door was closed and who wasn't you know and it takes some courage to do that um especially without shity that it would actually get done you know espe especially if they've campaigned on something that was slightly different and uh you know not everyone has that courage so through tax cuts I I learned the people who did have that courage and I went back to that well time and time again with on policies that that I thought was were important you know some were were bipartisan the Great American outdoors Act is something um it's incredible policy that I love that one yeah it's amazing it's one of the largest pieces of conservation legislation since the national park system was created and you know over 300 million people visit our national parks the vast majority of them being Americans every year so this is something that is real and beneficial for people's lives getting rid of the defered maintenance permanently funding them but there are there are other issues like that that just weren't being prioritized modernizing Perkins CTE you know in vocational education and it's something I became super passionate about um and and help lead lead the charge on um I think in in America for a really long period of time we've really believed that education stops when you leave high school or college and that is not true and that's a dangerous way to think so how can we both Galvanize the private sector to ensure that they continue to train workers for the jobs they know are coming and how they train their existing Workforce into the new job jobs with robotics or Machinery or new technologies that are coming down the pike so galvanizing um the private sector to join us in in in that effort so whether it's the legislative side like the actual legislation of of Perkin CT which was focused on on vocational education or whether it's the ability to use the White House to Galvanize the private sector we got over 16 million commitments from the private sector to retrain or skill workers into the jobs of tomorrow yeah there's so many aspects of Education that you helped on access the the stem and computer science education so the the CT thing you're mentioning modernizing Career and Technical education that's millions millions of people the ACT provided nearly $1.3 billion annually to more than 13 million students to better align the employer needs and all that kind of stuff very large scale policies that help a lot of people it's fascinating education often isn't like the bright shiny object everyone's running towards so one of the hard things in in politics when there's something that is good policy sometimes it has no momentum because it doesn't have a cheerleader so where are areas of good policy that you can like literally just carry across the Finish Line because people tend to run towards what's the news of the day sort of to try to address whatever issues being talked about on on the front pages of papers and there's so many issues that that need to be addressed and you know education is one of them that's just under prioritized you know human trafficking that's an issue that I didn't go to the White House thinking I would work on but you hear a story of a Survivor and you can't not want to eradicate one of the greatest evils that the mind can even imagine you know the traffic of people the exploitation of children and I think for so many they assume that this is a problem that doesn't happen on our Shores you know it's something that that you may experience at far-flung destinations across the world but it's happening there and it's happening here as well and so through a coalition of people that on both sides of the aisle that I came to trust and and to work well with we were able to get leg ation which the president signed passed nine pieces of legislation combating trafficking at home and abroad and digital exploitation of children how much of a toll does that take seeing all the problems in the world it's such a large scale the immensity of it all was that hard to walk around with that just knowing how much suffering there is in the world as you're trying to help all of it as you're trying to design government policies to help all of that it's also a very visceral recognition that there is suffering in the world how difficult is that to walk around with you feel it intensely you know we were just talking about human trafficking I mean you don't design these policies in the absence of the input of survivors themselves so you hear their stories remember a a woman who is really influential in my thinking Andrea hipwell who she was in college where she was lured out by a guy she thought was a good guy started dating him he gets her hooked on drugs convinces her to drop out of college and spends the next five years selling her she only got out when she was arrested and all too often that's happening too that the victim's being targeted um not the perpetrator so we did a lot with doj around changing that and um but now she's helping other survivors get skills and job training and um the therapeutic interventions they need but you you speak with people like Andrea and so many others and I mean you can't not your your heart gets seized by it and it's it's both it's motivating and it's hard it's really hard I was just talking to a brain surgeon many of the surgery has to do he knows the chances are very low of success and he says that that uh wears at his armor yeah it chips away it's like only so many times can you do that and thank God he's doing it because I bet you there a lot of others that don't choose that particular field because of those low success rates but you can see the pain in his eyes like maintaining your Humanity while doing all of it you could see the story The you could see the family that loves that person just you feel the immensity of that and you you you you feel the Heartbreak involved with mortality in that case and with suffering also in that case and in general and all these human trafficking um but even helping families try to stay afloat trying to break out or Escape poverty all of that you get to see those stories of struggle it's not easy um but but the people that really feel the humanity of that feel the pain of that are probably the right people to be politicians but it's probably also why you can't stay in there too long it's the only time in my life where you actually feel like there's always a conflict right between work and life and making sure you know I as a woman I'd often get asked about you know how do you balance work and and family and and I never I never liked that question because balance it's like elusive right you're you're one fever away from like no balance you know like your child's sick one day uh what do you do um there goes balance or you know you have a huge project with a deadline there goes balance like I think a better way to frame it is am I living in accordance with my priorities um maybe not every day but every week you know every month and and reflecting on have you architected a life that aligns with your priorities so that more often than not you're where you need to be in that moment and service at that level was the one time where you really you feel incredibly conflicted about having any priorities other than serving it's finite you know in every business I've built you're building for duration you know and then you go into the White House and it is sanr and our glass whether it's 4 years or 8 years it's a finite period of time you have and most people don't last four years I think the average in the White House is 18 months it's exhausting um but it's the only time when you're at home with your own children that you feel you think about all the people you've met and you feel guilty about any time that's spent not advancing those interests in to the best of your capacity and that's a hard that's a hard thing that's a really hard feeling as a parent and it's really challenging then to be to be present to always need to answer your phone you know to always need to be available it's um it's very difficult it's taxing but it's it's also the greatest privilege in the world so through that the turmoil of that the hardship of that what was the role of family through all that Jared and the kids what was that like that was that was everything you know to have that to have the support systems I had in place with with my husband and you know we had we had left New York and wound up in Washington and New York I lived 10 blocks away from my mother-in-law who if I wasn't taking my kids to school she was so we lost some of that which was very hard but we had What mattered which was each other and um and you know my kids were young when I got to Washington Theo my youngest was 8 months old and Arabella my oldest my daughter was 5 years old so they were still quite young we have a son um Joseph who was three and uh and I think for me like the dose of levity coming home at night and having them there and just joyful and um it was super grounding and important for me I still remember Theo um when he was around three three and a half years old Jared used to make me coffee every morning and it was like my great luxury that I would sit there he still makes it for me every morning I told him I'm never even though I I secretly know how to actually work the coffee machine but I've convinced him that I have no idea how to work the coffee machine now I'm going to be busted but um it's a skill I don't want to learn because it's it's one of his like acts of love he brings me coffee every morning in bed while I read the newspapers and um and Theo would watch this and so he got Jared to teach him how to make coffee and Theo learned how to make like a full-blown cappuccino nice and he was so he had so much joy in every morning bringing me this cappuccino and I remember like the sound of his little steps you know like the slide it's um it was so cute coming down the hallway with my like perfectly foed cappuccino now I try to get him to make me coffee and he's like come on Mom that was a moment in time but we had a lot of like little um moments like that that were just amazing so yeah I got a chance to chat with him and he has a his silliness and sense of humor it's um yeah it's really joyful yeah I could see how that could be an escape from The Madness of Washington of the adult life the quot we really kept like our home life pretty sheltered from everything else and we were able to do so because they were so young and because they weren't connected to the internet they were too young for smartphones all of these things we were able to shelter and protect them and allow them to have as normal as upbringing as was possible in the context we were living and uh and they brought me like and continue to bring me so much so much joy but they were I mean without Jared and without the kids it it would have been much more lonely so three kids you've now upgraded two dogs and a hamster uh well our second dog so we We rescued him thinking he we thought he was probably like part German Shepherd part Lab is what we were told he's now I don't even know if he qualifies as a dog he's like the size of a horse Sim um so I don't think he has much lab in him I think we Joseph has not wanted to do a DNA test um because he really wanted a German Shepherd so he's a German sheer he's he is gigantic and we also have a hamster who's the newest edition because my son um Theo he tried to get um he tried to get a dog as well our first dog winter um became my daughter's dog as she wouldn't let her brother others play with him or sleep with him and was old enough to bully them into submission so then Joseph wanted a dog and got Simba Theo now wants a dog and uh has Buster the hamster in the interim so we'll see what advice would you give to other mothers just having planning on having kids and maybe advice to yourself how to continue figuring out this puzzle I think being a parent um you have to cultivate within yourself like hid in levels of empathy you have to really look at each child and see them for who they are what they enjoy what they love and and and meet them where they're at and I think that can be enormously challenging when your kids are so different in temperament you know as they get older that difference in temperament may be within the same child depending on the moment of the day um but it it really I think it's actually made me um a much softer person a much better listener I think I see people more truly for for who they are as opposed to how I want them to be sometimes and I think being a parent to three children who are all exceptional and all incredibly different has has enabled that in me I think for for me though they've also been like some of my greatest teachers in that we were talking about the the presence you felt when you were in the jungle and the the connectivity you felt and sort of the simple joy and I think for for us as we grow older we kind of Disconnect from that like my kids have taught me how to play again um and that's beautiful I remember just a couple of weeks ago we had one of these crazy Miami torrential downpours and Arabella comes down it's around 8 o'clock at night it's it's really raining and she's got rain boots and pajama pants on and she's going to take the dogs for a walk in Rain which you know she had all day to walk but she but she wasn't doing it because they needed to go for a walk she was like this would be fun yeah and I'm standing at the doorstep watching her and she goes out with Simba and winter this massive dog and this little tiny dog and I'm watching her walk to the end of the driveway and she's just dancing and it's pouring and I took off my shoes and I went out and I joined her and we danced in the rain and even as like a Preen who normally you know she like allowed me to experience the joy with her um and it was it was amazing we can be so much more fun if we allow ourselves to be more playful we can be so much more present I look at Theo loves games so we play a whole lot of board games any kind of game um so it started with board games um we do a lot of puzzles uh then it became card games I just taught him how to play poker nice he he loves backhanding like any kind of game and he's so fully in them you know when he plays he plays my son Joseph he loves nature and he'll say to me sometimes when like I'm taking a picture of something he's observing like a beautiful sunset he's like Mom just experience it like yes you're right Joseph just experience it you know so so they those kids have taught me so much about sort of reconnecting with what's real and what's true and being present in the moment and uh and experiencing Joy they always give you permission to sort of uh reignite the inner child be a kid again yeah and it it's interesting what you said that the puzzle of noticing each human being like what makes them beautiful the the unique characteristics like what they're good at yeah the way they want to be mentored like I I often see that um especially with coaches and athletes young athletes aspiring to be great each athlete needs to be trained in a different way like I for example with some you need a softer approach like with me I always like like a dictatorial approach I like the coach to be this like menacing figure that's one that brought out the best in me I didn't want to be friends with the coach like I want to almost I it's weird to say but yelled at like put to be pushed but that's doesn't work for everybody uh and that's a risk you have to take as a in the coach context of like because you can't just yell at everybody yeah you have to figure out like what does each person need and when uh you have kids I imagine the puzzle is even harder and when they all need different things but yet coexist and are sometimes competitive with one another so you'll be at a dinner table the the amount of times I get well that's not fair why did you let and I'm like life isn't fair and by the way like I'm not here to be fair I'm like I'm trying to give you each what you need especially when I've been working really hard and you know in the White House I'd say okay well now we have a Sunday and we have these hours and I I'll have like a grand plan you know and we're going to make it count and it's going to involve you know hot chocolate and sleds and you know whatever whatever it is that like my great adventure that we're going to go play mini golf and then I come down all psyched up all ready to go and uh the kids have zero interest and there have been a lot of times where I've been like we're doing this thing and and then I realized wait a second you know like sometimes you just like plop down on the floor and start playing magne tiles you know and like that's where they need you and so so those of us who have sort of like Alpha personalities who sometimes it's just just witness like witness what they need don't like play with them and allow them to lead the play Don't force them down a road you may think is more interesting or productive or educational or edifying you know just just be with them observe them and and then show them that you are genuinely curious about the things that they are genuinely curious about I think there's a lot of love when you do that also there's just fascinating puzzles was talking to a friend yesterday and she has four kids and uh they fight a lot and she she generally wants to break up the fights but she's like I'm not sure if I'm just supposed to let them fight and they figure it out or you always break break them up because I'm told that it's okay for them to fight kids do that they kind of figure out their own situation that's part of like the growing up process but you want to always especially if it's physical they're like pushing each other want to kind of stop it but uh at the same time it's also part of the play part of the Dynamics and that's a puzzle you also have to figure out and plus you're probably worried that they're going to get hurt if they're well I think there's like when it gets physical that's like okay we have to intervene I know you're into martial arts but but that's normally like the red line um you know once it once it tips into that but there is always that you know like you have to allow them to problem solve for themselves like a little interpersonal conflict is is good it's really hard when you try to navigate something because everyone thinks you're taking their s you have oftentimes incomplete information it's um I think for parents what tends to happen too is we see our kids fighting with each other in a way that all kids do and we start to project into the future and like catastrophize you know if like my two sons are going through a moment where they're like oil and water anything one wants to do the other doesn't want to do it's like a very interesting moment so my instinct is they're not going to like each other when they're 25 you know you sort of project into the future as opposed to recognizing this is a stage that I too went through and it's normal and not building it in your mind into into something that's unnecessarily consequential it's shortterm formative conflict yeah so uh ever since 2016 the the number and the level of attacks you've been under has been steadily increasing it's been super intense how do you walk through the fire of that you've been very stoic about the whole thing I don't think I've ever seen you respond to an attack you just let it pass over you and you stay positive and you focus on solving problems and you didn't engage while being in DC you didn't engage into the back and forth fire of the politics so what's your philosophy behind that I appreciate your saying that I was very stoic about it I think you know I feel things pretty deeply so initially some of that really took me off guard like some of the derivative love and hatred um some of the intensity of of of the attacks um and there were times when it was it was so easy to counter it I'd even write something out and and say well I'm going to I'm going to press send and never did I I felt that sort of getting into the mud fighting back it didn't run true to who I am as a human being like it didn't it felt at odds with with who I am and how I want to spend my time so I think as a result I was often times on the receiving end of a lot of a lot of cheap shots and I'm okay with that because it's sort of the way I know how to be in the world I was focused on things I thought mattered more and you know I I think part of me also internalized there's a concept in Judaism called lanara which is translated into I think quite literally evil speech and the idea that you know you know speaking poorly of another is almost the moral equivalent to murder because you can't really repair it you can apologize but you can't repair it another component of that is that it does as much damage to the person saying the words um than it does to the person receiving them and I think about that a lot I talk about this concept with with my kids a lot um and I'm not willing to pay the price of that bleeing and momentary satisfaction of of sort of swinging back because I think it would be it would be too expensive for my soul and and that's how I kind of made peace with it because I think that's just that feels more true for me but it is a little bit contrary in politics it's uh it's definitely um it's definitely a contrarian Viewpoint um to to not get into the fry actually someday I love Dolly pardon says that um she doesn't condemn or criticize she loves and accepts and I like that it feels it feels right for me I also like that you said that words have power it's not sometimes people say well words when you speak negatively of others Ah that's just words but I think there's a cost to that there's a cost like you said to your soul and there's a cost in terms of the damage it can do to the other person uh whether it's to their reputation publicly or to them privately it's just is a human being psychologically and and in the place that it puts them because they think they start thinking negatively in general and then maybe they respond and there's this vicious downward spiral that happens that almost like we don't intend to but it destroys everybody in the process you quoted Alan Watts I love him in uh saying quote you are under no obligation to be the same person you were five minutes ago so uh how of the years in DC and the years after uh change you I love alen WS too I I listen to his uh lecture sometimes falling asleep he's got like an on planes he's got like the most soothing voice but um but I love what he said about you have no obligation to be who you were 5 minutes ago because we should always feel that we have the ability to evolve and grow and and and better ourselves I I think further than that if we don't look back on her who we were a few years ago with some level of embarrassment we're not growing enough right so there's nothing I when I look back I'm like oh you know it's I feel like that that feeling is you know because you're growing into into hopefully you know sort of a better version of yourself and I hope and feel that that's been that's been true for me as well I think the person I am today you know we spoke um in in the beginning of our discussion about um some of my earliest Ambitions in real estate and in fashion and those were amazing adventures and um and incredible experiences in government and I feel today that all of those Ambitions are more fully integrated and to me as a human being I'm much more comfortable with the various pieces of my personality and that any Professional Drive is more integrated into more Simple Pleasures like everything for me has gotten like much simpler and easier in terms of what I want to do and what I want to be and and um I think that's where you know my kids have been my teachers just being fully present um and enjoying like the little moments and it it doesn't mean I'm any less like driven than I was before it's just more a part of me than um being sort of the allc consuming energy one has in their 20s yeah just like you said with your mom be able to let go and enjoy the water the Sun the beach yeah and enjoy the moment the simple the Simplicity of the moment I think a lot about the fact that you know for for a lot of young people they they really know what they want to do but they don't actually know who they are and then I think as you get older hopefully you know who you are and you're much more comfortable with ambiguity around what you want to do and accomplish you're more flexible in your thinking around those things and give yourself permission to be who you are yeah you made the decision not to engage in the politics of the 2024 campaign if it's okay let me read what you wrote on the topic quote I love my father very much this time around I'm choosing to prioritize my young children and the private life we are creating as a family I do not plan to be involved in politics while I will always love and support my father going forward I will do so outside the political Arena I'm grateful to have had the honor of serving the American people and I will always be proud of many of our administration's accomplishments so can you explain your thinking your philosophy behind that decision I think first and foremost it was a decision rooted in me being a parent um really thinking about what they need from me now you know politics is is a rough rough business and I think it's one that you also can't dabble in I think you have to either be all in or or all out and I know today the cost they would pay for me being all in emot Al in terms of my absence at such a formative point in their life and I'm not willing to make them bear that cost I serve for four years and and feel so privileged to have done it but as their mom I think it's it's it's really important that I do what's right for them and and I think there are a lot of ways you can serve you know I think there's obviously we talked about the enormity the scale of what can be accomplished in in government service but you know I think there's something equally valuable about helping within your own Community um you I volunteer with the the kids a lot and we feel really good about that service it's different but it's no less meaningful so I think there are other ways there are other ways to serve I also think for you know politics is um is a it's a pretty dark world like there's a lot of Darkness a lot of negativity and it's just really at odds with what feels good for me as a human being and you know it is it it's a really it's a really rough business um so so for me and my family it it feels right to not participate so it wears on your soul and uh yeah there is a bit at least from an outsider's perspective a bit of dark darkness in that part of our world I wish it didn't have to be this way me too I think part of that darkness is just watching all the legal turmoil that's going on what's it like for you to see that um your father involved in that going through that on a human level it's my father and I love him very much so it's it's painful to experience but uh ultimately I wish it didn't have to be this way I like it that underneath all of this I love my father is the thing that uh you lead with that's so true it is it is family uh and I hope uh amidst all this turmoil love is the thing that wins it usually does in the end yes but in the short term there is like we were talking about there's a bit of bickering but at least don't no more duels no more duels you mentioned Dolly Parton that's a segue that's this listen I'm not very good at this thing I'm trying to figure out okay now we both love do Parton um I so uh you're you're big into live music so maybe you can mention why you love Dolly Parton I definitely would love to talk to I would love to interview her she's such an icon she's such incredible human what I love about her and I've really come to love her in recent years is she's so authentically herself and she's obviously so talented and um and so accomplished and this extraordinary woman but I just feel like she has no conflict within herself as to who she is um she reminds me a lot of my mom in that way and and it's super refreshing and and really beautiful to observe somebody um somebody who's so in the public eye being so fully secure and in who they are what their talent is and and what drives them so I think she's she's amazing um and she leads with a lot of like love and positivity so I think she's very cool I hope you have a long conversation yeah she's like okay so there's many things to say about her first like incredibly great musician songwriter performer yeah also can create an image and have fun with it you know like have fun being herself like over the top it feels that way right like she's really she enjoys after all these years it feels like she's enjoying she like enjoys what she does and you also have the sense that if she didn't she wouldn't do it that's right and just an iconic country musician country music singer yeah um there's a lot we've talked about a lot of musicians who do you enjoy you mentioned Adele seeing her perform hanging out with her yeah I mean she's extraordinary her voice is unreal um so she is I find her to be so talented and she's so unique in that three-year-olds love her music she was actually the first concert Arabella ever went to too um at Madison Square Garden when she she was around four and 90-year-olds love her music and that's pretty rare to have that kind of um bandwidth of resonance so so I think she's so talented we actually just saw her I took all three kids in Las Vegas around a month ago Alice Johnson um whose case I had worked with in the white house um my father commuted her sentence her her case was brought to me by a friend Kim Kardashian and um and she came uh to the show we all went together with some mutual friends and I was like a very profound it was amazing to see Adele but it was a very profound experience for me to have with my kids because she rode with us in in the car on the way to the show and and she talked to my kids about her experience and her story um and how her case found its way to me and and I think for young children it's very abstract you know policy and so for her to be able to share with them this was a very beautiful moment and led to a lot of really incredible conversations with each of my kids about our time and service because you know they gave up a lot for for me to do it actually Alice told them the most beautiful story about the plays she used to put on in prison how these shows were like the hottest ticket in town like you could not get into them they always extended their run and um but for the people who were in them a lot of those men men and women had never experienced Applause nobody had ever shown up um at their games or at their plays or and and clapped for them and the emotional experience of of just being able to give someone that you know being able to stand and and and applaud for someone and how meaningful that was and she was showing us pictures from these different Productions and it was a really it was a beautiful moment Alice actually after um her sentence was commuted and and she came out of prison together we worked on 23 different pardons or commutations so so the impact of of her experience and how she was able to to take her her opportunity and and create that same opportunity for others who who were deserving and and who she believed in was was very beautiful so anyway that was an extraordinary Concert Experience for my kids to be able to have that moment what a story so just that's the sort of the uh and here we are dancing at Adele exactly exactly like that turning point six years later it was almost to the day six years later so that that policy that meeting meeting of the minds resulted in a major turning point in her life and Alice's life and now you're dancing with a d and now we're at a Dell yeah I mean uh you mentioned also other I've seen commutations where it's it's a it's an opportunity to step in and consider the ways that the justice system does not always work well um like in cases when it's nonviolent crime and Drug offenses there there's a case of a person uh you mentioned that received the life sentence for selling weed yeah yeah it you know and it's just the number it's like hundreds of thousands of people are in the federal president jail in the system for drug for selling drugs that's the only thing with no no violence on their record whatsoever and it's obviously there's a lot of complexity there's the details matter but often times the justice system does not um do right in the way we think right is and it's nice to be able to step in and help people like and direct they're overlooked and they have no Advocate Jared um and I helped in a small way on his effort but he really um spearheaded the effort on on Criminal Justice Reform through the first step act which was an enormously consequential piece of legislation that gave so many people another opportunity and that was amazing uh so working with him closely on that was was a beautiful thing for us to also experience together but in the final days of the administration you know you're not getting legislation passed um and anything you do administratively is going to be probably overturned by an incoming Administration so you know how do you use that that time for maximum results and I really like dug in on on Pardons and commutations that I thought were were um were overdue and and were worthy and um and my last night in Washington DC I uh the gentleman you mentioned Corvin I was on the phone with his mother at uh 12:30 in the morning telling her that her son would be getting out the next day you know so and it felt really it's it's one person but you see what Alice like the ripple effect of you know the commutation granted to her and her ability and the impact she'll have within her family with her grandkids um and now she's an advocate for so many others who are voiceless you know it felt like it felt like the perfect way to end four years to be able to um to be able to call those parents and call those kids in some cases and and give them the news that a loved one was coming home and I just love the cool image of you Kim Kardashian and Alice just dancing in a Del show with the kids I love it well Kim wasn't at the adult show but but she's the got it she had connected us it was beautiful beautiful the way adult like can hold just like the badassness she has on stage like the she does like heartbreak songs like better than anyone or no it's not even heartbreak like what's what's that genre of song like Rolling in the Deep like a little anger a Little Love a Little like something a little attitude and just like one of the greatest voices ever all that together just her by herself yeah you can strip it down and the power of her voice you know I think about that one of the things you're talking about live music one of the amazing things now is you there's so much incredible concert material that's been uploaded to YouTube so sometimes I just sit there and watch these like old shows um we both love Stevie rayon like watching him perform you can even find old videos of like Jango Reinhardt you got me I got you Texas flood we had this moment which is hilarious that you said like one of the songs you really like of Stevie is Texas Flood well my bucket list is to learn how to play it it's a bucket list this is a bucket list it you made me feel so good because for me Texas Flood was the first solo on guitar I've ever learned because for me it was the like the impossible solo yeah and then that so I I work really hard to uh to learn it it's like one of the most iconic sort of blues songs Texas blues songs and now you made me fall in love with the song again want to play it out live at the very least put it up on YouTube and because it is it's so fun to improvise and when you lose yourself in the song it truly is a blues song you can have fun with it I hope you do do that throw regardless I want you to play it for me 100% 100% but he's he's amazing and and you know there's so many great performers that are playing live now um you know I just saw Chris Stapleton show he's an amazing country artist he's too good he's so that guy is so good uh Lucas Nelson's one of my favorite to see live and there's so many incredible songwriters and musicians that are out there touring today but I think you also you can go online and watch some of these old performances like Jango Reinhardt was the first because I torture myself was the first song I learned to play on the guitar and it took me like nine months to a year it was I mean I should have chosen a different song but ou2 monamore his um one of his songs was and it was like finger style and I was just going through and and grinding it out and and that's kind of how I started to learn to play by playing that song but to see these old videos of him playing yeah you know without all his fingers and and and the skill and the dexterity one of my favorite live performances is actually who really influenced Adele as artha Franklin um and she did this she did a version of Amazing Grace have you ever seen this video no I cried look up it was in LA it was like the temple Missionary Baptist Church talk about strip down she's literally a I mean just listen to this you could do one note and you could just kill it the pain the soulfulness the spirit you feel like in her when you watch this that's true a Del carries some of that Spirit also right yeah and you can take away all the instruments with theele and just have that voice and it's so commanding and it's so amaz anyway you watch this and you see like the Arc of also the experience of the people in the choir and them starting to join in and it's anyway it's it's amazing I love watching uh Queen like Freddy Mercury Queen performances yeah like in terms of vocus and just like great stage pres that live a performance is like considered one of the best of all I I've watched that so many times he's so cool pull up that for a second go to that part where where he's saying Radio Gaga and they're all um mimicking his arm it's so cool look at that man I missed that guy so good so that's an example of a person that was born to be on stage so good well we were talking surfing we were talking Jitsu I think live music is one of those kind of rare moments where you can really be present um where something about the anticipation of choosing what show you're going to go to and then waiting for the date to come and normally it happens in the context of community you go with friends and um and then allowing yourself to sort of fall into it is is incredible so you've been training Jiu-Jitsu yes trying um I mean I've seen you do Jiu-Jitsu you're you're extremely you're you're very like athletic you know you know how to use your body to commit violence maybe there's better ways of phrasing that but anyway it's been a skill that's been honed over time yeah I mean um what do you like about Jiu-Jitsu well first of all I love the way I came to it it was my daughter um I think I told you this story she's at 11 she told me that she wanted to learn self-defense and um and she wanted to learn how to protect herself which I just as a mom I was so proud about because at 11 I was not thinking about defending myself you know I loved that she had sort of that desire and awareness um so so I I called some friends actually a mutual friend of ours and asked around for for people who I could work with in Miami and they recommended the Valente Brothers Studio and um you've met all three of them now they're these remarkable human beings and they've been so wonderful for our family I mean first starting with Arabella I used to take her and then she'd kind of encourage me and she'd sort of pull me into it and I started doing it with her and then um Joseph and Theo uh saw us doing it they wanted to start doing it so now they joined and um then Jared joins so now we're we're all doing judu and for me there's something really empowering knowing that I have some basic skills um to defend myself I think it's something as humans we've kind of gotten away from you look at any other animal and you know even the giraffe they'll use their neck The Lion The Tiger every species and then there's us you know who most of us don't and I didn't know how to protect myself and I think that it it gives you a sense of confidence and also gives you kind of a sense of calm you know knowing how to deescalate rather than escalate a situation I also think as part of the training you um you develop more natural awareness when when you're out and about and I feel like especially you know everyone's you get on an elev and like the first thing people do is pick up their phone you're walking down the street they're people are getting hit by cars because they're walking into traffic I think as you start to get this training you become much more aware of the broader context of what's happening around you which is which is really healthy and good as well but it's been beautiful they actually the Valente Brothers they have this 753 code that was developed with some of the sort of Samurai principles in mind and all of my kids have memorized it and they'll talk to me about it at Theo he's eight years old he'll he'll able to recite all 15 so you know benevolence and um and Fitness and Nutrition and flow and awareness and balance and it's an unbelievable thing and they'll actually integrate it into conversations where they'll talk about something that happen yeah rectitude courage benevolence resp respect honesty honor loyalty so this is not about Jiu-Jitsu techniques or fighting techniques this is about a way of life about the way you interact with the world with other people exercise nutrition rest hygiene positivity that's more on the physical side of things awareness balance and flow it's the mind the body the soul effectively is how they break it out and and the kids can only advance and get their stripes if um they really internalize this they give examples of each of them and and my own kids will come home from school and they'll tell me examples of how things happen that weren't aligned with the 753 code so it's it's a framework much like religion is in our house and and can be for others it's a framework to discuss things that happen in their life large and small and um and has been beautiful so so I do think that like Body Mind connection is is super strong in in Jitsu so there's many things I love about the Valente Brothers but one of them is the uh how rooted it is in philosophy and history of Martial artarts in general you know a lot of places you'll practice the sport of it maybe the art of it but to recognize the history yeah and what it means to be a martial artist broadly on and off the mat that's really great and the other thing is great is they also don't forget the self-defense route the actual fighting routes so it's not just a sport it's a way to defend yourself on the street in all situations and that gives you a confidence in just like you said an awareness about your own body and aw Wess about others yeah it is you know sadly we forget but there's a it's a it's a world full of violence or the capacity for violence so it's good to have an awareness of that and a confidence how to essentially avoid it 100% I I've seen it with all of my kids they've and and myself how much they benefited from it but um that self-defense component and the philosophical elements of you know they Pedro will often tell them about like wooe and sort of soft resistance and um and some of these sort of more Eastern philosophies that they get exposed to through through their practice there that are um sort of non-resistance that that are beautiful and and hard Concepts to internalize as an adult but but especially um you know when you're 12 10 and and eight respectively so it's it's and it's been an amazing experience for us all I love people like Pedro cuz he he's like finding books that are like in Japanese and translating them to try to figure out like the details of a particular history like he's a he's like an ultra scholar of martial arts and I love that I love when people give everything every part of themselves to the thing they're practicing yeah you know people have been fighting each other for a very long time and I love from the Coliseum on you can't fake anything you can't lie about anything yeah it's it's truly honest you're there and you either win or lose it's simple and that's like it's also humbling that the the reality of that is humbling and oftentimes in life things are not that simple not that black and white so it's nice to have that sometimes that's that's the biggest thing I gain from Jiu-Jitsu is getting my getting my ass kicked which The Humbling and it's nice to just get humbled in a very clear way Sports in general are great for that I think surfing probably I can imagine yeah just you know yeah face planting not being able to stay in the board uh it's humbling and the power of the wave is humbling uh so just like your mom you're an adventurer are there your your bucket list is probably like 120 Pages there are things like just pop to mind that you're like thinking about especially in the near future just anything well I hope it all always is long you know I hope I've never like exhausted exploring all the things I'm curious about I always tell my kids whenever they say you know Mom I'm bored only boring people get bored like there's too much to learn there's too much to learn so I've got a long one I you know I think obviously there are some like immediate tactical you know interesting things that I'm doing I'm incubating a bunch of businesses I'm investing in a bunch of companies that hopefully I'll always can continue to do that some of the fun things doing in real estate now so those are all on the list of things I'm passionate and excited about you continuing to explore and learn but um in terms of the like the the ones that are more pure sort of Adventure or hobby I think I'd like to climb Mount kjaro actually I know I would um and I the only thing keeping me from doing it in the short term is I feel like it'd be such a great experience to do with my kids um and I'd love to have that experience with them I also told Arabella we were talking about this archery competition that happens in Mongolia and she loves horseback riding so I'm like I feel like that would be an amazing thing to experience together um I want to get barreled by a wave and and learn how to play Texas Flood um I want to see the Northern Lights like I want to go and and experience that um I feel like that would be really beautiful I want to get my black belt like you nice I asked you how long did it take um but so I want to get my black belt and Jitsu that's like a that's going to be a longer term goal but with within the next decade um yeah a lot of things you know I'd love to go to space I'd like not just space I think I'd love to go to the moon like step on the moon yeah or float you know in close proximity like that famous photo yeah it's just you and a the space dud I feel like Mars is at point in my life well the moon's like 4 days feels more more manageable I don't know but the sunset on Mars is blue it's the opposite color I hair is beautiful might be worth it I don't know you negotiate with Theo yeah let know how let me know how it goes I think actually just even go in a space where you can look back on Earth yeah I think that just to see this little pale blue dot pale blue dot just all the stuff that ever happened and human civilization is on that and to be able to look at look at it yeah and just be in awe and I think that's the thing that will go away I think being interplanetary my hope is that that heightens for us how rare it is what we have like how precious the Earth is um I hope that it I hope that it has that effect uh because I you know I think there's a big component to to interplanetary travel that kind of TAPS into this kind of manifest destiny inclination like the human desire to conquer territory and expand um the footprint of civilization that sometimes feels much more rooted in like dominance and Conquest than curiosity wonder and um and obviously I think there's you know maybe an existential imperative for it at some point or um a strategic or andsecurity one but um but I hope that what feels inevitable um at this moment I mean you know Elon Musk and what he's doing with SpaceX and Jeff Bezos and others it it feels like it's not an if it's a it's a when at this point I hope it also underscores like the need to protect what we have here yeah and it's I hope it's the Curiosity that drives that exploration and I hope the exploration will give us a deeper appreciation of the thing we have back home and that Earth will always be home and it's a home that we protect and celebrate what uh gives you hope about the future of this thing we have going on human civilization the whole thing I think I feel a lot of Hope when I'm in nature I feel a lot of hope when I am experiencing people who are good and honest and pure and true and passionate and that's not an uncommon experience so those experiences give me hope yeah other humans were pretty cool I love Humanity we're awesome you know not always but um but we're a pretty good species yeah for the most part on the whole we do all right we do all right we we create some beautiful stuff and uh I hope we keep creating and I hope you keep creating you have already done a lot of amazing things build a lot of amazing things uh and I hope you keep building and creating and uh doing a lot of beautiful things in this world Ivanka thank you so much for talking today thank you Lex thanks for
