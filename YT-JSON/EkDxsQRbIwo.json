        "transcript": "what if you could eliminate procrastination forever so that it's not just easy to do your work but your mind actually gets sucked toward the task and you blaze through it like a knife through butter we call this buttery execution it's the antithesis of procrastination and in the next few minutes I'm going to show you how to master now I'm ran darus co-founder and COO of the flow research Collective along with my partner Steven Cutler we've taught thousands of professionals how to perform at their Peak by accessing flow States at will now which of these three types of procrastination do you most fall victim to one is inertia this means you have important work to do you're getting paid to do it you blocked out time to do it often you even enjoy doing it and yet you still can't get yourself to do it the second kind of procrastination is distractibility this means you've started the work but the slightest distraction diverts your attention and before you know it half the day is gone because you've veered off to other things and you're too stressed to start the important task but too guilty to do anything else and then third third is chronic delay this means you continuously postpone major life goals or projects telling yourself you'll pursue them someday but never getting past the starting line inertia prevents you from starting work distractability diverts your focus mid task and chronic delay perpetually postpones and prevents progress for me the most torturous form used to be inertia for example I was once tasked with a speech for my friend's wedding as his best man and despite its significance and the honor it represented I found myself delaying postponing and yes procrastinating it loomed there and casted this uncomfortable Shadow over every day that passed now contrary to popular belief procrastination is not a symptom of lacking motivation rather procrastination is often High motivation plus inaction that's precisely what makes it so bloody painful it's the I want to do it but I can't bring myself to do it effect and that's because of of a neurochemical civil war that happens within our brains known as the approach avoidance conflict this conflict occurs between two systems the approach system associated with dopamine rich areas of the brain like the striatum and ventral tegmental area which are linked to pleasure and reward and encourage action and then the avoidance system associated with cortisol rich areas of the brain like the amydala and hippocampus which are linked to fear and anxiety which encourage inaction and this results in a cognitive contradiction dopamine flows the brain and stimulates wanting and craving while cortisol floating the brain stimulates fear anxiety in this approach avoidance conflict you experience both positive and negative aspects of a task as you get closer to the task the negative aspects become more prominent increasing the avoidance tendency then as you move away from the task the positive aspects become more Salient increasing the approach tendency you know how this goes when away from your desk the thought of the book you'd love to write and share with the world excites you but as you you boot up your word processor you dread looking at that blank page so this creates a tug-of-war between approach and avoidance motivations this approach avoidance conflict blocks us from engaging so we never initiate the flow cycle and access Flow State in the first place now you no doubt experienced this approach avoidance conflict many times this approach avoidance conflict will keep you out of the flow cycle forever now what is the flow cycle for over a decade beginning in the '90s my business partner Stephen Cutler chased some of the best action and adventure sport athletes in the world following them into the mountains the waves and even the sky Steven discovered something fascinating all of these athletes were harnessing the power of flow States this optimal State of Consciousness where humans feel and function at their best in flow these athletes could perform previously unattainable Feats that were advancing their respective Sports faster than any other sport for example big waves in surfing used to be 30 foot in mere years 80f Footers became the norm in the '90s a front flip on a BMX was considered suicidally dangerous years later a triple front flip became the standard flow is turning today's Unthinkable into tomorrow's new norm and unfathomably fast by interviewing and observing these athletes about how they pulled off these insane Feats Steven realized all these guys were accessing flow in a specific Way by using the flow cycle and contrary to popular belief flow isn't binary it's not like a light switch either on or off rather flow is part of a four-phase cycle struggle release flow and recover in struggle you have to fight for the task to absorb you the norepinephrine involved causes frustration anxiety discomfort release happens once you reach the edge of wrestling with the task or problem through task persistence and the pain relief of endorphins rush into the system flow happens next the state of effortless attention where your sense of self evaporates the prefrontal cortex quiets down and serotonin and dopamine drive you forward and then recovery happens after float replenishing the costly neurochemistry the state requires and rejuvenating after so much energy expenditure now for these action and adventure sports athletes you can think of the struggle phase like a warm-up the first wave the first run down the mountain the beginning of a climb but outside of the action sports arena there's something else we've discovered about flow in helping teams at Audi enture Facebook the US Air Force all sorts of the world's leading organizations harness the power of flow in their workspaces we've realized there's something you could think of as a fifth stage to the flow cycle it only lasts a few seconds but for modern professionals it's even more challenging than the struggle itself and it is starting to struggle in the first place for Action Sports athletes this is the moment they decide to bomb down the hill jump out of the airplane or wade into the water this pre- struggle stage that cripples so many folks in the workplace is called engage and compared to what happens next in struggle for Action Sports athletes the engage phase is the easy part you just have to jump off that Ridge or slide down that Mountain but engage is much harder for knowledge workers so now you understand that procrastination is just approach avoidance conflict your tool set to overcome it is to either build up the desire to approach the task so that it overwhelms the avoid tendency or secondly soften the avoidance tendency down so that your existing desire to approach the task can smoothly roll through without the avoid tendency blocking it so here are tools for doing this so you can Master the ability to engage the flow cycle and Trump procrastination for good number one is to laser attention with ridiculously clear goals back in the 1960s pioneering psychologist and co-founder of positive psychology Mii chmi High spearheaded one of the largest psychological studies ever done at the time interviewing a diverse range of individuals from Navajo sheep herders to factory workers musicians and athletes and all of these people experienced Flow State regularly as chmi high dug deeper into how they approached their respective activities he discovered that flow didn't happen randomly rather it had preconditions or triggers that caused it to emerge reliably in those who experienced the stay one of these flow triggers in particular can cut through procrastination like a knife through hot butter this flow trigger is called clear goals clear goals are distinct from goals run a marathon take my kids to Disneyland save for retirement they may be goals well clear goals are the target for your attention not the overall outcome we're looking to achieve for example a clear goal is trying to get the soccer ball in the the outcome may be trying to win the soccer game now when you focus on the outcome of your actions you're really relying on your prefrontal cortex it's powerful but also an inefficient energy hog when you focus on the target you rely on the basil ganglia an older part of the brain that executes familiar habits it's efficient and requires less energy to Leverage The automaticity of your basil ganglia focus on putting the ball in the net not on winning the match this is not only easier but it's also much more conducive to flow clear goals activate the central EX executive Network for task planning and leads to motivation via dopamine surges which help to diffuse the approach avoidance conflict so the first step to annihilating procrastination is to set wildly specific clear goals for each task and I mean wildly weirdly specific that way the brain doesn't have to expand resources on wondering how why or what to do to achieve this break the task down into microscopic goals even if this is a small task that might only take you an hour this way you get a steady drip of dopamine by making the task you're procrastinating on so tiny that it almost feels like reactive work that is by taking the big meaty task you're delaying fragmenting it down into microtasks and so easy to achieve that they are comparable to the things you do to get dopamine hits you get dopamine hits from bite-sized substeps of the bigger task that you would otherwise be putting off for example number one might be open my laptop number two might be pull up the Google dock number three might be write the intro to the presentation the next one maybe add the data for client results into the presentation design the graphics with our brand colors whatever it is make the first action so easy requiring so little energy that there's nothing left for the brain to resist and you can just write this down on a sheet of paper that you're going to throw away or in the notes app on your phone it doesn't need to take long this keeps your brain from wondering what's the first step when you map out these wildly clear minuscule microscopic level clear goals within the task execution starts to feel as smooth as a knife through melted butter you slide right into doing it and then flow emerges from there next you can further amplify the power of clear goals by combining it with another of flow's most potent triggers which brings us to the second step to annihilating the approach avoidance conflict and banishing procrastination and that is to tune the challenge skills balance so far we know of over 20 triggers for Flow State but one of these triggers is so powerful it's often considered not just a trigger but a precondition for float required for any of the other triggers to work and it's called The Challenge SK skills balance and it's critical for overcoming procrastination this balance refers to the optimal relationship between the perceived level of challenge a task presents and your perceived skill or ability to perform the task if the challenge is too high you're prone to anxiety and to overwhelm if the challenge is too low though you're bored you're apathetic you want to hit that 4% sweet spot where the challenge just slightly outstrips your current skill level that's when the task will absorb your attention and you'll slide right into floow so how do we tune the challenge skills balance to melt away procrastination well there's a few ways the first challenge skills balance regulator is to lower the hurdle back when I was a teenager in Ireland I once tried to set up a website service business for months I spent 16 hours a day call calling trying to sell websites to accountants and I was getting torched averaging 250 calls a day I face constant unrelenting rejection what makes you think we want your Services one had barked earlier that day scam someone else spat another every morning the first two hours were by far the most brutal I grappled with paralyzing crippling procrastination the very idea of picking up the phone and making that initial cold call was such an immense hurdle that I would just delay and delay and delay the problem was I wasn't earning a dime unless I made a sale the way I saw it at the time if I didn't call I'd go broke then I had a revelation I could tweak my approach to make those initial hours a bit more bearable instead of diving straight into Co calls I began my day by reaching out to existing clients the ones who liked me knew me and were friendly these interactions were positive and I knew what response to expect this strategy lowered the initial hurdle building up confidence and momentum for the day once warmed up I'd shift gears and brave the co calls again and this worked because the more effort you need to engage the more likely procrastination will occur conversely the less effort required to engage the easier it is to start the struggle phase and begin to cycle into Flow State ultimately what we're avoiding when we procrastinate is energy expenditure which is an evolutionary adaptation to preserve precious resources for only the essentials required for reproduction if you trick your system into using fewer resources then the drive to avoid and procrastinate dips down so you've got two options increase effort or adjust a situation so that it requires less effort most people do the former attempting to spike effort up by guzzling coffee getting all caffeinated or just white knuckling through the task this is like gritting your teeth and trying to jump over a high hurdle at first this is exactly what I was doing with cold calling but in hindsight rather than jumping over the high hurdle through willpower alone I should have just lowered the hurdle in the first place like I eventually did a better play for your Roi your return on invested effort is to restructure things so that we can engage with less effort like lowering the hurdle so you can easily step over it now the second way to regulate the challenge skills balance is to regulate time we can use time as a variable that regulates the challenge level of a given task often how much time you have to complet a task determines how difficult it is if you're procrastinating on your tax returns which is a painfully boring task for many then actually limit and suppress down the amount of time to do it give yourself an hour instead of a week which UPS the challenge to The Sweet Spot for flow if the challenge is too high so complex that just thinking about the thing hurts your brain then do the opposite give yourself way more time than you think you need to complete the task this lowers the challenge level allowing you to hit the sweet spot for flow and blast through procrastination and the third way to regulate the child skills balance is to define the scope have you ever tried to complete a thousand piece jigsaw puzzle without knowing what the final picture looks like well the uncertainty is overwhelming and tilts the challenge skill balance toward anxiety the same applies to work if you don't know the scope of the work what's needed or how long it will take and there's a risk that it could take 30 minutes or 3 hours you resist the task it's like opening Pandora's Box the solution is to just take a little bit of time to figure out the true scope of the work this will rarely be perfect but just aim for as much CL as you can asking what needs to be done why does it need to be done by getting clear here you'll boost the perceived importance within the task the context and for you which makes it easier to engage now the third way to be procrastination and master the approach avoidance conflict is called bypassing or response inhibition response inhibition refers to the ability to override an automatic reaction to stimuli and to choose a go driven Behavior instead like joining your friends and jumping into a cold River before you can pause to Recon consider here's why response inhibition is important as soon as emotional parts of the brain like the amydala have a chance to take over they override our ability to self-regulate when this happens we experience more anxiety about the negative consequences of our actions and are less able to filter out emotions related to the task you'll notice that if you start dilly-dallying before getting into the river the emotional part of the brain that's trying to protect you will win from there it'll become increasingly difficult to Brave the cold instead the more conscious part of the brain that knows it'll it be fun to join your friends for a swim will dive in within 5 minutes by the time you're in there it's too late for the emotional part of your brain to take over you aim to get ahead of the approach avoidance conflict before it even kicks in this prevents procrastination from surfacing in the first place earlier I told you about my experience with cold calling well that story is a happy ending an ending I never would have experienced without training up my response inhibition one day when making my call calls through sheer luck an accountant called Martin Gil Christ picked up the phone he saw something in my grit most would have quit long ago he said let's let's talk business and in time we worked together and became Regional finalists for arland's best young entrepreneur but the real win was training myself to engage to overcome the approach avoidance conflict despite the temptation to procrastinate it was a Triumph of will response inhibition over the prepotent biological urge to avoid just like jumping in a cold shower before I had a second to inhibit the response I trained myself to immediately click dial so that the person would ask answer and say hello before I could even think about it in the end that approach worked but there's a better way than Brute Force there's a way you can leverage your neurochemistry to dial up your response inhibition with the sleep to flow strategy prevailing wisdom says we should wake up drink lemon water meditate take a cold shower and prepare for the work day but in the morning there's a brain State you can harness to take the likelihood of procrastination way down you increase your response inhibition and at the same time you drive your access to flow way up that's because the Delta and Theta brain waves and sleep are close to the alpha and Theta brain waves found in flow Alpha Waves reduce prefrontal cortex activity leading to a sense of effortlessness and reduce self-consciousness your inner critic theta waves are associated with heightened creativity enabling the brain to make novel connections and solve increasingly complex problems more efficiently harnessing these brain waves is simple get to work the second you wake up if you have everything prepared you can be typing within 60 seconds of getting out of your bed and if you've been resisting work this gives you no way out you won't have time to even be awake enough to distract act yourself and procrastinate you override the emotional part of the brain and activate your prefrontal cortex there's no room for the avoid and approach systems to be at odds this doesn't mean you wake up and start checking email it means you wake up and you work on the important tasks you have been procrastinating on you need to set everything up beforehand for this to really work but it's highly effective and it trains the skill of bypassing now the fourth way to master the approach avoidance conflict is with something called the flow payoff Flow State feels incredible it's one of the most pleasurable EXP experiences humans can experience courtesy of the cocktail of neurochemicals it produces in the brain but there has to be a high likelihood of getting into flow and for long enough in order to want to engage in the first place building a sand castle on the beach is less motivating if the tide can wash it away at any moment but the same applies to work if you know you'll be interrupted after you start working the approach avoidance conflict will cause you to resist the task you need to be certain that you'll get the reward for all that struggle for example I remember remember when I first started working with Steven Cotler we launched this huge professional training event to pull this off I had to conduct hundreds and hundreds of sales calls in order to sell tickets to the event at the same time I was trying to build out the curriculum and plan the whole event itself which required large stretches of deep focused work inflow with all these sales calls I ended up with this swiss cheese likee calendar constant meetings with little time in between since the sales calls tilted everything in between calls I found it hard to muster the willingness to to work on the curriculum design even with the pressure building as the event got closer and closer trying to engage was like trying to resist the effects of a potent sedative even though I'd sometimes get into flow for a little bit between calls I couldn't sustain Flow State long enough to justify the struggle of starting to engage it'd be like going surfing would you bother with all the struggle of waking early waxing the board squeezing into a tight wet suit and paddling out if you knew that after one or two waves there was a very high likelihood that the ocean was just going to go flat on you like that I know I wouldn't there's just not enough of a flow payoff for the struggle and it's the same thing with starting focused work you rally your focus block distractions and psych up to persist through the struggle phase but if you know there's a high likelihood you're going to interrupted after 15 30 or 45 minutes it's more difficult to do so without a sufficient uninterrupted flow session the struggle feels pointless there's no waves to catch to make sure the struggle is worth it so you don't procrastinate fix your schedule to avoid a swis schedule collapse meetings where possible from in-person to zoom zoom to phone phone to email email to text text to nothing canceling the meeting ideally given that research has found that 70% of meetings are completely unnecessary and when not possible batch your communication outside of your Peak productive hours and bookend your meetings either knock them all out at the beginning of the day or write up against your hard stop for the day after your flow blocks remember flow is activity specific you can either be in flow during a meeting or be in flow doing doing deep focused work but Crossing between these types of activities breaks flow now there's a final aspect to procrastination that we need to address and that is what if what feels like procrastination isn't actually procrastination at all but a signal that you should pay close attention to now when I was first scaling one of my education companies we were going to partner with an engineering team that was going to build us a custom learning management system I was utterly convinced that this new LMS was the ultimate unlock for being able to scale our business and hit our numbers for that year we had a lot writing on the deal people were counting on me and yet I found myself continually delaying the calls with our point of contact procrastinating on the product scope document day after day now what was going on here I was staying on top of every other task and key meeting for the business but kept avoiding meeting with these Engineers something just felt off deep down intuitively I knew that this partnership was actually a bad move for the business I couldn't explain why or even be fully conscious of it at the time but was showing up as procrastination was actually something else it was actually ambivalence that I was feeling ambivalence often has the same symptoms as procrastination but it's something totally different this ambivalence was signaling to me that we were about to get locked up in a contract that would eat away at our profits for something that we didn't need at all thankfully I was able to reinterpret this procrastination as ambivalence and call off the partnership saving us six figures a month in what would have been completely unnecessary EXP es in the end so procrastination is the desire to avoid doing something you should do both variables desire to avoid and the thing being something you should do need to be present for it to be procrastination however sometimes you have the desire to avoid doing something which is a signal that you should not actually go and do that thing or that you should be doing that thing in a fundamentally different way so it's crucial to be able to distinguish between the approach avoidance conflict showing up as procrastination and ambivalence showing up as an intuitive sense that you shouldn't continue to do a given thing you want to overcome procrastination you want to pay attention to ambivalence and you want to avoid mixing up those two signals because ambivalence can yield insight and you can use it to level up and approach things more effectively maybe you're not aligned with your values goal stack or intrinsic motivators maybe you've burned out or you're not playing to your strengths when you become attuned to ambivalence disguised as procrastination it leads to thank God we didn't do that realizations afterwards but these only come in hindsight so you must build the skill of actually interpreting procrastination to recognize ambivalence in real time now remember procrastination is natural but optional you can eliminate it by leveraging flow triggers like clear goals the challenge skills balance and fixing your schedule for a great flow payoff The Compound Effect of never saying no to what needs to be done will give you reliable access to flow and lead to extreme progression and accomplishment after working with thousands of professionals we found that one of the most effective ways to make procrastination irrelevant is to wait W up and flop we touched on this briefly here but for a deeper dive click [Music] here"
