        "transcript": "hey guys it's Christian and today I want to talk about Microsoft Azure I know many people will know say oh Christian what the hell why should we care about Microsoft as a public cloud provider when we have a home lab hold on in this video I'm addressing exactly this question plus I will give you a brief introduction to Microsoft erer and some of the amazing free services they provide because honestly I'm very excited about learning Microsoft aure right now and if you are interested in it and Tech you probably should should be too so let's find out why look I'm most likely not telling you anything new when I'm saying Microsoft Azure is such an important player in the professional IT industry it's besides AWS and Google one of the three leading Cloud Platforms in the magic quadrant named by Gardner and 95% of the Fortune 500 companies in the world trust Azure with their business every single day but I want to tell you a more personal story yeah because as you might know my background is more in the home lab and self hosting space however I'm also working in a cyber security company where in the last months I've been heavily involved into some really cool devops and automation projects and one of the key technologies that we were using in those projects was surprise Microsoft Azure and if you know nothing or maybe just a little about Microsoft Azure like myself I can definitely tell you that even setting up a simple shed storage can be quite a heavy challenge if you do it the first time now that all got me thinking about if I really would like to learn this because I need it for work I should probably use it in my home lab too and to my surprise once I started to look into it I realized that Microsoft has added some really interesting features on their platform to support this type of workflow so not just putting everything into their Cloud but combine the best of some valuable cloud services with cost-efficient plans and on premise in infrastructure besides that they also have tons and tons of free services like free credits free trainings I'm for example planning to do some really exciting projects with Azure next year but I thought I want to give you a good introduction to Microsoft Azure right now before I do that and not to forget it of course a big Thanks goes out to Microsoft for supporting this video and making it all possible to easily get started with Microsoft Azure just head over to their official homepage azure.com and click on one of the buttons to create a free account like try Azure for free and as you can see they offer you some really interesting services that are free for 12 months and they even give you $200 of azure credits to easily get started within the first 30 days now you just need to click on start free and sign in with your Microsoft account and then you need to complete their setup so select your country and region add your address information and so on you also need to fill in credit card information but don't worry this is mainly just for identification they won't automatically charge you once the trial period ends so you still need to confirm this if you want to continue with their pay as you go service and once you completed the sign up process it should take you to a screen like this this is the Azure web UI where you can create and manage all your Cloud resources and the very first thing that you should always do is go into this settings menu and change your appearance settings to dark mode because we all love dark mode yeah and you can also of course select any other options for the web UI that feels right to you you can also change and customize most of all these different Windows here add specific reports to the dashboard create your own dashboards for viewing certain types of things but we don't want to do that right now because Microsoft Azure has so many different things it has so many different types of resources buttons options and yeah I know it can feel quite overwhelming when you see it the first time and you actually don't really know where to start but but don't worry this is why we have this tutorial here all right before we start creating our first Cloud resources on Microsoft Azure let's also talk about some of the free stuff they provide because I know you all love free stuff and yeah I do too so let's talk about it besides the $200 of free credits that you can use in 30 days for by the way any type of resource you like there are essentially two different groups of free services in Microsoft Azure the first one is probably the more exciting stuff which is for your first 12 months being on Microsoft Azure so once you start creating your Azure account it starts counting while some other ones are always free which are mostly Management Services but also sometimes useful stuff like erra functions web applications or databases if you want to create a virtual machine with either windows or Linux operating system you have 750 hours for free on one of those different plans by the way we'll later talk about pricing and sizing of those different plants so what the hell means b1s B2 pts who knows that yeah but these are mostly really valuable plans to create free virtual machines on Microsoft Azure which is great and you also got Azure SQL databases which is always free so of course with some limitations yeah on the performance and uh storage capacity also Cosmos DB Azure app Services is always free and also Azure functions with 1 million requests absolutely amazing because one thing that might be a bit different on my Microsoft Azure than on any traditional hosting or smaller cloud provider is that nearly everything in Microsoft Azure requires a different type of resource for example we already covered you got like virtual machines for Linux or Windows 750 hours for free within the 12 months 64 GB of SSD storage here so that perfectly aligns to the resources you're going to need for creating virtual machines but also other things like public IP addresses or security plans those type of resources can produce additional costs so you really should carefully check what type of resources are free on Microsoft aure and what others might produce costs if you want to learn more about all those different types of azure resources I can just recommend go to the Microsoft Learning Center so there you will find so many different types of resources like videos training courses documentation they even got virtual events like the Microsoft virtual training days where you sometimes get an Azure certification completely for free with a video course I once did a video about the Microsoft a900 certification I think it's probably already like 2 or 3 years old but you can still watch it I will link you that in the description there I took the a900 exam and I shared some of the tips for you that might help you to go through it but there you will learn so many fundamental skills about Microsoft Azure about the different types of resources so yeah if you need to learn anything just look it up now let us go back to the web uio of errow and let me just show you around a bit so on the left side you got a menu where you can just go back to your home or your dashboard what is also useful if you click on all resources so there you got a list or a table with the different resource type and the resource Group and the location and when you click on all services you get a huge list of all those different types of resources and again you can just click on one of them for example if you need virtual machines just type in Virtual machines click on that and then you get a table of all the different virtual machines that you have currently deployed one thing that might be also useful for you is the cost management and building center and I just want to show you that at the beginning because this is one thing that always worried me a bit in Microsoft asra because you have all those different types of complex resources and it's sometimes a bit hard to get an overview of what actually produces cost and what is included in the free plan the cost Center is really amazing for getting a good overview and analyzing the costs if you go to cost analysis you get a graph of all the different resources and the cost that they produce as you can see there is also a forecast for the end of the month so you can see that I probably need to pay €1 at the end of December for running cloud services on Microsoft Azure and I can now filter depending on what type of resource is it what produced the most cost as you can see storage is currently the thing that is the most expensive for me if it would be included in the free plan you would not see anything here but also virtual net is creating some cost probably there are also some resources depending on public IP addresses so public IP addresses is a special thing we will talk about that but again if you ever worried about costs of Microsoft aure just go to the cost center do a cost analysis you can even set up cost alerts so that you're not overe exceeding your budget that can be very very useful and with those two different things like the free services that they provide and a transparent cost analysis you should get a good overview of what you actually need to pay okay I know this was a pretty long introduction and I'm sorry for that I get it you just want to see me creating some stuff here in Azure Andy let's do that yeah I want to just show you some of the fundamental stuff that you're probably always going to need when you're creating some stuff on Azure like the first thing that we should cover are resource groups you can find it in the left menu again if you don't find something you can always go to all services and just search for it yeah for example type in resource groups and then click on that that will will take you to the resource groups view now if you create any resource on Microsoft Azure you need to assign it to a resource Group and a resource Group is something like a logical container to organize and manage different types of related resources usually you put everything together that shares the same life cycle of typically something that is deployed together or updated together or deleted together but you're completely free with how many resource groups you create and what you put in those yeah for example I just put everything in one Resource Group but once I start creating or adding more environments like in a different location or production testing environments then I should separate it in other resource groups there you can just create it here with a plus icon and then you need to select a subscription and that's the next thing I need to explain a subscription that is like a service plan so if you just signed up on Azure and you are within that trial period that will be your service plan but once you switch your account to a pay as youo service plan you will need a subscription for that and so resources within that same subscription are always charged together so usually you just will have one for example I have one production subscription where my credit card is charged for any type of resource that is created within that subscription so let us create a resource Group demo one for example and then choose a region now erer has many many different re regions around the globe not all products are available in all regions and those regions also have different availability zones for example in West Germany we have three availability zones is if I'm correct and you probably can just select a region that is nearby or where you just want to distribute your services by the way what's very interesting is this page here I will link you that in the description down below so here you will find some of the geographical uh data centers around the globe and you can find out more about those regions for example Germany West Central is a location in Frankfurt and of course you got different types of compliance offerings products that are available in those regions you can check out what different types of regions are existing as you can see Europe are two data centers one is in Ireland one in Netherlands and you can choose whatever fits your requirements back to Aur UI let's click on next and then you can also select tags here for example if you want to give it a tag like production environment or or whatever I'm usually not doing this because I'm the only one who is managing it but if you have a team with yeah 20 30 people you probably want to give taxs to the different types of resources asro is always validating if the information that you entered is correct when you're creating more complex resources it might take a bit longer to validate and create those things here for example this is our new Resource Group demo one and now we can start creating some resources and assign it to this Resource Group let's for example first create a new SSH key because we're going to need that to authenticate to our virtual machine that we create here in a minute so let's go back to all services and let's search for SSH Keys click on that and then create a new SSH Key by the way you can also go to all resources here and click on create this is an alternative view where you can also search for different types of resources here and also discover some other stuff here like third party apps and yeah there's a huge Marketplace for so many different things things yeah but we just going to need SSH key for now so let's select this and click on create now again we always need to select a subscription here even though SSH keys are usually not charged as far as I know and we also need to select our Resource Group I always need that even for production so I'm just going to select this Resource Group you can still use SSH keys on servers that are located in the different Resource Group so don't worry about that I will just give it the name set SSH and no I don't want to generate a new pair I want to upload my existing public key okay that's fine let's just go to review and create this SSH key and here we go now we have our SSH key created the next thing that we're going to need is a virtual Network to assign a local IP address let's again go to all services and search for virtual networks click on that and as you can see I already created a production virtual Network now I probably want to create another another one because the production one is managed by the production Resource Group and because we have created a new Resource Group we should also create a demo Network for our demo virtual machines here give it a name like net demo 1 for example select the region where I want to deploy this next you can also set up some security information like adding aure firewall DDS protection you need to be careful because some of these options here might be paid services that are not included within the free ones so don't say C anything that you don't understand here go to next so here we can set up IP addresses yeah you can add an IP V4 address space or an IPv6 address space so I'm just going to create 1 921 168 0.0 with a subnet mask of 24 so we got 256 IP addresses for virtual machines and of course I also need to change this default address range here because we changed CH the subnet so you can click on edit or you can just delete it and add a new subnet and the subnet address space should be starting with 1 1921 1680 and goes up to the subnet size of 24 so the whole network basically let's just add this now we have this entry here and let's go to next I don't want to give it a tag so let's just straight go to review and create and now some resources take some time to deploy yeah you can always get a notification in the top corner here so you can track the progress of how long it takes or what is happening with your deployments if something does not work you will also get an error in here and you can troubleshoot and detect what's going wrong but as you can see our deployment was successful and we now got a virtual Network created in our Resource Group so that's fine okay so I think we got everything that we need for creating a new virtual machine in Microsoft Azure so let's go again back to all services and let's just search for virtual machines so let's click on that and that takes us to the virtual machines view as you can see I already deployed one for evaluation and testing stuff it's currently stopped and deallocated we also talk about what that actually means so let's create a new one here and select Azure virtual machines and now we can start fill in the information so of course we need to select the resource Group and I'm just picking the resource Group demo one and give this new v machine name I'm just calling it SV actually don't know what was the last number that I've created six or seven I really don't know I probably should come up with a better naming convention so let me just let me just call it temp for temporary one and now again we can select in which region or in which data center we want to create this virtual machine now what is very special about Microsoft Azure and any other big cloud provider that is probably not common on smaller ones is that you don't just get so many different regions where you can create resources you also got availability zones separate physical data centers so that means like in Germany West Central we have fre availability zones and I could now decide I want to create this virtual machine not in one data center but I want to create it in two or maybe all three of them and when one data center goes down so whatever crisis would happen I don't know a meteor or what could crash the whole data center but then I still two other data centers in Germany that could start a new process for my virtual machine that's a pretty great feature if you think about it but usually if you're just doing a test you don't need that so select the availability zone no infrastructure redundancy required then you don't need to mess around with this and then of course we need to select an image so here you can select from different types of operating systems and Linux distribution no these are of course not all images yeah if you click on see all images you get a huge list in the marketplace with over 7,000 results of virtual machine images and you can probably find everything in here you can even upload your own custom images which is a feature that you also don't always get with other hosting or cloud provider so Microsoft aure gives you a huge amount of options here I I just prefer most of the time just deploying Ubuntu servers I just like this Linux distribution a lot so I'm just selecting Ubuntu 2204 LTS in the lat generation now you need to select a size so how many resources do you want to give to that virtual machine and as you can see it automatically selected the standard size of DS1 V2 I don't know if that's still the default if you're within the 12 months of trial period but as you can see this deploys resource with one CPU core and 2.5 GB of memory which would cost $48 a month in that list you can select different types of sizing again these are just the recommended stuff if you want to see all sizings again you get a huge list of over 600 different types of VM sizings depending on how many products are available within your data center region and you can add filters to find their specific uh combination of memory CPU and data disk that you need you can also select no grouping so then you get a huge list of all the different things and you can filter it for example you could order it based on the cost per month and as you can see this is the cheapest um machine that you can Pro that you can provision the B1 LS and this comes with one CPU core and 0.5 gab of memory which is not a lot so you probably want to go at least with one gigaby of memory so as you can see this is the b1s and this is one of the free services eligible uh plant so uh if you remember in the pricing table there were a few selections that are free within the 12 months for 750 hours so this is one of those plants that is free after the 12 months it costs you $876,000 with two CPU Calles and 8 GB of memory that would cost $83 a month so and that can seem a lot now one thing I probably should address at this point here is the pricing yeah because often people say Microsoft eror is too expensive which is definitely a topic that is often misunderstood if you just compare the pure pay as you go prices with dedicated virtual Machines of traditional hosting providers or maybe smaller Cloud vendors like Lode or digital ocean yes it may appear expensive however it is not a fair comparison in my opinion first a pricing is similar to other major Cloud providers like AWS and gcp and second if you consider traditional horsing providers or smaller Cloud vendors for running your servers fine so be it but you have to keep in mind they of course don't offer you the same features and options like Azure they are not even close to that however if you're not interested in those advanced features like GE redundancy and so on and you're just looking to run a couple of virtual machines to host your website or testing stuff the question might still come up so why choose Azure if the pricing is so much higher than on other hosting providers well one thing you have to understand is that cloud machines are not always used in the same way as a v server or a dedicated instance because Azure offers you the advantage of creating and provisioning new Cloud resources within just seconds and you only pay for each allocated resource per hour so if you only run your v machine for a few hours or a day for testing purposes and you deallocate it afterwards the pricing model actually becomes more coste effective than paying a fixed price per month for a dedicated machine that runs 24/7 and what most people don't know in addition to the default pays you go pricing what we've seen in the table Azure also provides two other pricing options where they give you huge amount of discounts the first are the reserved plans so if you already know that you're going to need a server for a longer duration so maybe to host a website or whatever type of service you want to deliver you can purchase a one-year or three-year reserved plan Azure often gives you between 50 and 60% discount on a freee plan which can be a huge difference and a great option for business critical operations that you want to commit to on a longer time period and the next option would be azure spot so this will bring the cost down even further up to 90% of discount sometimes which is crazy if you think about it but the big difference between a reserve plan and Azure spot is that this is only an option for non- business critical workloads Azure only gives you that huge amount of discount when they have more resources available than customers are actually using so that basically means you can use some of their unused resources in their data centers without any problems but if for whatever reason one of their pays youo customers decides to provision a couple of thousand new viral machines a day and they should fall short on resources they might deallocate your Azure spot instance to provide their committed slas so never use it for business critical stuff but for testing or simple home lab experiments Azure spot is always my way to go so if you go back to the creative virtual machine window and select run with Azure spot discount it gives you a couple of more options like you can can choose the eviction policy that so that means what happens when erz would need to deallocate your machine should it delete it or should it just stop and deallocate the resources until they are free again so I would always choose that you otherwise it might happen that your Azure visual machine gots deleted and you never know why and then you can go to see all sizes and now you got a slightly different table in here so let's again just select no grouping and we added the filter Azure spot supported so now when we go to the right side and yeah we can let's select the display cost to monthly so we can easy easier compare it and now let's try to find the DS1 V2 without Azure spot this did cost $48 so now it costs $490 and the two CPU course and 8 GB machine that did cost around like $80 $90 now costs $840 cents per month so this is a huge discount as I can see this is 90% cheaper and also the eviction rate is pretty low so the chance that Azure might deallocate your machine because it needs it for other uh customers is pretty low on those plants you can see all those different plants have different uh eviction rates for example I would never really choose that one here because it has a 20% plus eviction rate so just have a look at the table see what you need and where you think you get the most value of it again for testing and home lab experiments I always just use those Azure spot in so I'm just going to select the d2s V3 so we got a machine with two cores and 8 GB of memory let's select this one and now we can select how we want to authenticate to that machine with an SSH public key or password again we just created it so I'm just going to select my username in here and use one of the existing Keys start in Azure so now we can select our SSH key that we have created in the beginning now you can also select if you want to allow incoming parts to be forwarded to the virtual machine again we need SSH to authenticate from outside but you could also add HTTP or https if your hosting websites or any other thing that you can of course also customize here so let's select next and then you also need a dis for this wi machine again depending on what type of dis service plan if you want to use a premium SSD or a standard SSD this again costs a different amount of money if you need a Zone redundant storage so if the data is r replicated to all fre availability zones of the region then you would need to select one of those plants but for our testing I think it's just fine to use a standard SSD that is locally redundant within just within that data center and of course I want to delete it with evm if you don't select this and you delete your VM your dis is still existing it might produce cost but everything else seems fine so let's just go to networking and here we just want to select our virtual Network that we've created and select select our subnet 192 1680 and you can also select here if you want to create a new public IP address so again public IP address produced costs and as far as I know the public IP addresses here are not included in the three in the 12th month so this is one thing you need to take care of especially if you create more than one virtual machine and you create one vir uh one public IP address for each of those virtual machines it will also add up to the cost so that's why I decided to not do it this way but I use a public IP address that I assigned to a load balancer and this load balancer forwards different types of ports to my internal virtual machine so with that trick you can even bring the cost down further because you don't need a separate public IP address for every virtual machine you can just use a load balancer and assign one public IP address and forward it to multiple servers that's also possible maybe I do a separate video about this but yeah for now let's just create a new temporary public IP address so of course I want to allow incoming ports 22 for SSH connection again here I could select other ports and customize it and I want to select this here delete public IP when the VM is deleted same with the dis okay that's fine let's go to management and yeah this is just I I leave it by default uh you can set up if you want to automatically shut it down so this can be pretty useful if you want to use that for testing stuff but you forget to shut the machine down because if you deallocate a machine it will not produce cost anymore so sometimes I set up a specific plan every night to automatically shut down all the machines that I don't need if I for whatever reason forget it but yeah I don't do it right now let's go to monitoring so again all of this stuff Diagnostics alert and those kind of things I leave it by default let's go to Advanced here you could add some Cloud init data if you want to automatically provision this machine with specific settings like using Linux packages whatever you want to do I'm not going to need that right now and also the TXS I don't need so let's go to review and create this okay so the deployment is now in progress it shouldn't really take long to provision a new virtual machine or Microsoft Azure and once this is done we try to authenticate and see what we got okay so our resource is now deployed we can just go to the resource and manage it if you want to change something you can also look up the public IP address in here so we can just copy this open a terminal and SSH into that machine and now we are logged in so that just took like I think that took below one minute I mean besides the whole creation stuff and so on but just the pure provisioning just took a few seconds so this is really really fast and you can do anything with that virtual machine that you want like install Docker run a couple of services experiment do whatever you just like to do with it but I want to show you one thing at the end of this tutorial because I think this could be pretty useful uh because you can manage all of this stuff here in the Azure web UI like see all the virtual machines and do things like that but I sometimes just prefer a terminal yeah for example if I want to stop or decate a machine or see what virtual machines are currently running and so forth so I sometimes just love to do it in a terminal and Azure provides you a command line interface that is called the Azure CLI that you can install on your local workstation like on this article I will link you that in the description so there you can find a tutorial how to install it on windows on Mac OS or on Linux you can even run it in a darker container or in A's Cloud shell so Cloud shell is when you go to the web UI and click on that small button over here it will open a cloud shell in your web browser but yeah I don't like web browsers for running command line interfaces so if you want to install that on Mac OS just install it with one simple command and then you got it once you install that you can open it with an AZ command so that should so that that should give you a description of all the different options here the very first thing that you need to do is of course securely authenticate so um type in AZ login so this will take you to a web browser where you need to sign up with your Azure account and then you are automatically authenticated with an A account show you can always display the detailed information about your Azure account and subscription and for example if you want to display all the virtual machines within your Azure account you can type in a a z and then VM list and it will give you a huge Json object that is sometimes a bit hard to read so what you should definitely do is type in asvm list and select the output as a table you just enter table it will give you a simple list of those virtual machines you can also add it-d parameter if you want to get more information about this takes a bit longer but it also shows you the public IP addresses and if the virtual machine is currently up and running or if it is deallocated again like this first virtual machine is currently running this is where we just logged in and what we've created if we want to stop this machine you can type in acvm stop and then you need to then you need to enter the name like SRV temp one and the resource Group rest demo one let's stop this for example so this will now power off the virtual machine in Microsoft azure stopping the virtual machine will still continue building so you really need to deallocate the VM to reduce the cost so there you just need to use the acvm deallocate command with the same parameters and then you are fine okay so that was completed let's go to the UI and let's refresh the window so there you can see it automatically uh reported the status stopped and I could know from a web UI just started or use the command start in Azure CLI and yeah just like that you can create and play around with Microsoft Azure use some of their free services that are always free like Azure functions web apps or within the 12 months create a test virtual machine to just play around with it and familiarize yourself with Microsoft Azure it's going to be worth it okay so that's it about my introduction to Microsoft Azure I know we barely scratched the surface and there are so many other cool and exciting Fe features we could explore I think I just need to familiarize myself a bit more with Azure experiment a bit and go through the trainings and the documentation by the way please tell me if that's a topic you'd like to learn more about and which specific things you'd be interested in so leave a comment below and of course don't forget to like the video and subscribe to the channel if you want to watch more videos and tutorials about nerdy Tech and homeab stuff thanks everybody for watching enjoy the rest of your day and because that is the last video of this year I wish you all the best and I will catch you in 2024 so take care everyone bye-bye"
