Peter Merkel who will lend his expertise to a discussion of EGP a diagnosis and the novel emerging treatment options available for the management of eg PA so stay tuned and we'll be right back [Applause] welcome back joining me today is dr. Peter Merkel a Rheumatologist from the University of Pennsylvania where he's director of the vasculitis Center please welcome dr. Merkel Peter great to see you nice to see you again so we've been talking about Easter Philip granulomatosis with polyangiitis cgpa you're a Rheumatologist I'm gonna pull monado so let's talk about a GPA from each of our perspectives so tell me how you perceive II GPA how do you make a diagnosis let's talk a little bit about that so II GPA as you know is one of the three ank associated vascularity so it's a type of vasculitis inflammation of the blood vessels and so much more as I like to say about vasculitis there's more to vasculitis than just vasculitis it affects almost every organ and it can often be organ threatening and life threatening each EPA is unique and it almost always is associated with asthma 90 plus percent of patients usually it precedes the other manifestations of disease and there's eosinophils increase in blood eosinophils often penetrating into tissues causing all sorts of issues so you know we see patients who often have had asthma sometimes adult onset only sometimes for a short period of time sometimes for years before something else happens or someone thinks about EGP a and then they get manifestations that could include sinusitis nasal polyps which you could say well that goes along with asthma and i had to be maybe that's not so weird but then they get how you stand if those also associate with asthma but then they can get rashes that are vascular 'dick or other inflammatory infiltrate sin the lung that's not infectious and often are very responsive to prednisone and then even more seriously neuropathy or or kidney disease or other manifestations they can be very troubling and very problematic especially heart disease and cardiomyopathy you may see patients presenting in a different fashion than I do but together we see the full spectrum yeah I think usually I see the patients who have asthma and eosin Affiliate who end up developing vasculitis and I suspect that you end up saying the patients who vasculitis who happened to have asthma in eosinophilia and that's how you make the diagnosis I would agree and I think both of us have specialty centers are concerned that patients often get missed by any of the different doctors that they might see for various issues and I think what we hope to do is increase awareness that if you have a patient with asthma who is beginning to develop these other manifestations or if a patient who with neuropathy or cardiomyopathy and have hints of this that you always think about EGP eh yeah exactly so what are some of the things that are in the differential diagnosis for eg pa and I see the patients who have the myeloproliferative variants of hai Prius and philic syndrome and the lymphocytic variants of hyper eosinophilic syndrome and then patients who have chronic iasts in the philippine money which can present a little bit like EG PA and that many of those patients have asthma many of those patients have sinus disease many of those patients have pulmonary infiltrates and eosin Affiliate and so it's almost like a GPA so what are some of the types of diseases entities that you see and how do you differentiate between EGP a yeah so I think in my practice of in our vasculitis Center Ana's rheumatologist we often see them after they've been at least have a hint that they have a spot or something else but I agree we really worry about what are we missing what hyper is Ana philic syndromes are we missing and then will often work with an allergist or pulmonologist you mean ologist helped us sort that out once we get a sense that it's not a parasitic infection it's not a malignant eosinophils disorder or a Vega form of hyper it's an affiliate we then need to differentiate it from other causes of vasculitis especially GPA and MPA and of course the asthma and the eosinophils really help you separate it patients with eg PA often present once they get beyond the asthma and sinus issues they can be fairly dramatic have a pretty bad initial exacerbation and then either often get better and then the asthma and the sinus and the other stuff becomes the major problem that drive things but relapse is more common that people think and nagging are going problems which can be quite severe and so we do need to make sure that we're not missing these other disorders and then as the disease goes on our hope of course is that our patients are doing fine but they can develop either other problems or complications of therapy and I think the things we most worry about are infections because the drugs we use suppress the immune system so we in terms of making a diagnosis is what type of workup do you do and in terms of establishing a diagnosis of each EPA and then once you've established a diagnosis of each EPA how do you monitor your patients and how do you follow up on your patients I think the most important aspect of making diagnosis is what I call the patient biopsy which is talk to the patient get a history go through the chart because often years before or months before they'll have hints they'll have the sinus to help the polyps they'll have the the quote pneumonia that didn't get better with antibiotics but someone gave them cuckoo corticoids steroids and they got better so I think a full history and then if we're thinking it might be a GPA I think you really need to make make sure you're not missing some of the major manifestations obviously a full neurologic exam as part of your full physical examination but you want we will check for ANCA because as you know 40% of patients are ANCA positive almost always with anti myeloperoxidase MPO ANCA and those patients have a different track they tend to more likely to have renal disease and less likely to have the heart disease and we might be might change our treatments based at their ANCA positive or not it's also very helpful diagnostically if we're thinking strongly about a GPA we'll get a CT scan of the head which gets your mastoids the sinuses the orbits and a CT of the of the chest and I think these CTS almost always don't need to have contrast I know if you agree and you're looking for masses and nodules and infiltrates we're going to do a urinalysis a serum creatinine obviously a CBC and it's here I'm is tena fills and we're gonna after you've done your full fist erine physical and we're gonna try to peach it patch it all together if there's skin lesions a biopsy can often be useful and I think you really want to go back and get a sense of what their course has been often patients by the time they're considered to be GPA have already received glucocorticoids multiple times antibiotics so do you check a troponin on your patients do you check out Co cardiogram when to use cardiac MRI I will get an echocardiogram on any patient I think either I know has a GPA or I suspect moderately strongly has a GPA you don't want to miss the cardiomyopathy which is often an early manifestation of disease 3040 % of patients can have clinically apparent coding myopathy and maybe more not so clinically apparent we get a baseline EKG cardiac MRI interested in your thoughts is I wouldn't say controversial it's emerging technology I think we get it when we're not sure about the level of activity we're worried about other causes of cardiomyopathy so the patient that comes to the hospital with heart failure and you're beginning to think about each EPA that may be helpful as you gather evidence the patient who known have EGP a not sure it necessarily adds more someone argued that it's actually another way non invasively to follow patients disease what do you think yeah so I think we're still learning about the sensitivity and the specificity of some of the newer imaging modalities and what their role is I think it's important to followed certainly people who have active disease and have reduction their ejection fraction for instance those patients are all usually get a cardiac MRI and follow it to see if there's any hints of active inflammation going on what about the role of biopsies in general how often do you biopsy is it necessary to have a biopsy in order to establish a firm diagnosis of EGP or or is it more of a clinical diagnosis well I think it is I mean as you know the prior name was trickshots syndrome implying that it's not a specific disease I think we're learning more about this but it is rather syndromic so I agree with you that is generally a clinical diagnosis however I think biopsies serve two important reasons one you often get a biopsy to make sure you're not missing something else infection drug toxicity or another complete disease those biopsies I think skin if it's purpura and you can see actual vascular that's very helpful other but many of the skin lesions as you know are not proper ik and so they get other things how do you follow your patients and are there lab tests that you get on a regular basis Susie fall patients how do I follow patients well I think the most important thing is they need to be seen regularly they need to have an ongoing dialogue with the patient so that you can see how they're doing we followed their asthma sort of the usual fashion I'll defer to you to discuss that in detail given your expertise you followed their asthma you follow their upper airway disease often in collaboration with I'm a pathologist collaboration with the pulmonologist and/or ENT physician but we follow patients regularly clinically we're certainly going to follow their laboratory studies mostly the monitor for the drug toxicities that could happen you want to make sure you're not missing kidney disease especially in the patients who are ANCA positive because that can be silent and I think imaging is very useful I if there's initial infiltrative disease I want to make sure I've gotten a follow up image to re-establish the baseline so that you can see things changing and then you brought up the issue of cardiac disease and I think once a patient has established cardiomyopathy you we're working with a cardiologist and there is serial imaging usually echocardiogram to follow along yeah so just as a palma nas I also follow pulmonary function testing and I think it's important to evaluate because asthma is a it's a controversial but important part of the disease from a pulmonologist from an allergy perspective that's what we tend to see and so you know we will follow lung function just which can vary a little bit with disease activity well Maya pulmonologists are right next door so I we get a lot of pulmonary function tests and I think you would agree prep will cut about treatment a moment but probably Cardinal one of the cardinal aspects of treatment is don't under treat the asthma treat the asthma treat the asthma yeah so from my perspective in terms of following patients I think one of the key things that I do is really I want to identify and tell patients to be vigilant for any new signs or symptoms and you know they should look out for any new GI manifestation any new neuropathy any worsening disease and then you know and I tell them to call me right away because even once diagnosed I want to know make sure that there isn't disease activity going on yeah I say patients are the early warning system they are the first ones to know if something new is happening and I agree with you I'd rather have them call us that's our job to interpret what's going on and sometimes we we can just make reassure on the phone and sometimes we're concerned and say come on in so I agree any new symptoms that you know really we want to hear about it because this is a strange disease they can do all sorts of things and and it's important to remember that just because a patient had a B and C when he or she was diagnosed doesn't mean they can't get x y&z later exactly exactly so we're gonna talk about treatment in a moment but before focusing on that I want to talk a little bit about the pathophysiology so that that'll sort of let us get to the point of how we should treat and targeted approaches so we know from the name yes Anna philic granulomatosis with polyangiitis that eosinophils played an important role and eosinophils our key cell there are important white blood cell and they have a lot of inflammatory mediators including yes Nephila cationic protein sniffle derived neurotoxin major basic protein that can get into the tissue and cause inflammation but it's also nangka associated disease so let's talk a little bit about ANCA what would tell me tell me what what the general practitioner needs to know about anti neutrophils cytoplasmic antibodies so ANCA of course are one of the most useful tests in medicine these days from an antibody standpoint it is a very specific test in the right setting with the right pretest probability it is very useful diagnostically for that spectrum of vasculitis called ANCA soceity vasculitis again 40% of patients 30 to 40% of patients each EPA will have NPO positive ANCA those patients tend to have renal disease not to have cardiac disease and we tend to treat them more like our other patients Bank associated vasculitis than those without but from a pathophysiology standpoint there is mounting evidence that ANCA is at least partially causing this disease or triggering disease its exact role is still controversial but there are very good animal models especially for MPO positive that it can cause command Fridays and other inflammation so it's part of the disease process you talked about eosinophils they can also trigger other other chemokines and signaling so can ANCA activation at the level of the vessel complement becomes active and I think that like most autoimmune and systemic inflammatory diseases there are multiple pathways at play and although we like to think that we know exactly what's going on it's almost always more complicated I agree I think it's very complex and you know there's roles a role yes impose but also probably neutrophils play a role and I think that that that we're still learning about all the different mechanisms of play and there's probably a genetic component as well as an environmental component as well and so we're still gaining a lot of information I think that's why we need to do more studies in these patients so we've talked about pathophysiology we've talked about presentation disease let's focus a little bit on treatment so what's your general approach to patients with EGP a from a management and treatment perspective well unfortunately unfortunately depending how you look at it the mainstay of therapy still remains to glucocorticoids and so prednisone and its various cousins are used incredibly often and this is of course because they work so they they work very quickly to treat upper airway and lower airway disease they can stop the process of vasculitis in various organs are in very quickly but they can be ravaging it's like to say to patients aside from the mania and the insomnia and the osteoporosis yesterda close to the cataracts glaucoma the hypertension the infections of diabetes mellitus and all the other problems what's not to love and so two-edged sword we it's the best they're the best drugs we have they're the worst drugs we have they work quickly but I think you and I have both been involved in research to try to find new medications that can reduce the burden of glucocorticoids additionally in some patients they don't work enough you can't keep people you don't want to keep people on high-dose glucocorticoids and you need other drugs to help keep the disease from coming back from keep them in remission remission maintenance and for relapsing additionally the the reasons that we still haven't figured out many patients no matter what else they're on often require at least low dose of glucocorticoids sometimes not so low just to maintain their disease and I would say it's especially asthma and they in the sinus and Pollak disease yeah so so I think treating the asthma and treating the sinus disease is really important and it's also important to involve other specialists as well ear nose and throat doctors allergist from an asthma and allergy perspective but then whatever other disease manifestations may be occurring I think you need to involve those physicians whether it's gastroenterologist nephrologist neurologists neurologists pain specialists hematologists I think all these kinds of specialists can be involved in the care so let's talk a little bit about therapy so you mentioned corticosteroids again the good and the bad about corticosteroids but what do you do when corticosteroids aren't working or if you can't get the dose of corticosteroids lower so I think we often depends on how the patient is presenting either initially or their relapse for patients with fairly severe disease especially central or peripheral neuropathy cardiomyopathy kidney disease or bad GI disease or other things you think are very serious we're usually going to add another immunosuppressive Asian from the beginning on top of the glucocorticoids the idea is that as you taper the glucocorticoids they have a soft landing and patients will stay in remission as you know there haven't been a lot of good trials there have been some we were part of an important one that you read there are about immunosuppressive agents we use a variety of different drugs for patients who are ANCA positive there's increasing experience with the use of rituximab early on in the course of that disease in addition to glucocorticoids for patients with severe cardiac disease bad neuropathy neuropathy many physicians many of us and others we use cyclophosphamide still at least for a few months and then go to another drug such as a sathya print or methotrexate there are as evidence that these can be useful but there's some question as to how useful they are in certain settings and the newest class of medications that as you know we're using are the il5 inhibitors as you mentioned that il5 is one of the side that may be triggering and may be involved in the pathophysiology so this includes metal is you mAb and other agents that are out there now for eosinophils like asthma and of course this is any acidic asthma in each EPA but in the trial that you did lead and ran we were able to show that MEP Elysium AB is useful for patients with least mild to moderate disease and helping to control some of the some of the manifestations of eg PA especially the asthma and the sinus and some of the upper airway symptoms and it was able to reduce the total amount of glucocorticoids which is very important for patients yeah and that's how you be demonstrated about a 50% reduction in the relapse rate in patients with eg PA and also about a 50% reduction in corticosteroid dosing in those patients so I think really important outcomes for many of our patients with eg PA it's also exciting that there are also a few new anti al-5 therapies that are in development currently approved for asthma like been realism AB and res lism AB and some preliminary data has been presented at some national meetings suggesting that there's efficacy of those therapies as well in terms of improving outcomes and in terms of reducing exacerbations and improving and reducing steroid dosing those patients I mean I think it's an exciting class of medications that we're using increasingly the safety profile is really quite good and I wouldn't underestimate how important it can be for patients to be reduced their predestine if it's from the 12 to 15 milligram level per day down to 5 5 to 7 that's a big difference it's a big toxicity difference and it's really important and additionally what we see as you know is that patients over time it's not just that they're on a dose of prednisone is that they have these relapses often several times a year especially of asthma or sinusitis and other problems and when you really begin to see they get a couple of weeks of high-dose glucocorticoids come down again to their usual level and again and again when you add it all up it's significant amount of glucocorticoids if we can flatten out that pad and have people have fewer exacerbations and stay on even their low dose I think that's a win yeah so it seems like the key outcomes that we're trying to treat in these patients are reducing corticosteroids reducing relapses and reducing the long term systemic manifestations of the disease I agree and they're so these class of drugs are very interesting and there will be future ones there's a lot of research being done now that I think can apply to each EPA and our goal is to find treatments that can eliminate glucocorticoids keep people safe and hopefully cure the disease yeah these are exciting times for these patients because in the past there were no real options for them yeah so this has been a great discussion I think we've had a lot of important information discussed about each EPA and when we come back dr. Merkel and I will be joined by a patient who is living with each EPA and will further explore real-world considerations in managing these patients so stay tuned and we'll be right back welcome back building in our previous discussion dr. Merkel and I will now be joined by a patient with eg PA and we'll take a closer look at some of the practical considerations when it comes to managing these patients please welcome miss Linda delicate ara Linda thank you so much for joining us great to see you so Linda Peter and I have been discussing the manifestations of each EPA and the history of eg PA how to make a diagnosis of eg PA you've been living with eg PA tell us a little bit about your journey how how old were you when you were diagnosed and how did they make a diagnosis of EG PA arrived at because first I started out with the adult onset asthma and then some chest x-rays done which showed some ground-glass passages in my lungs hyper is an affiliate and then some skin lesions sort of put all of that together over what period of time did that occur how long did it take to make a diagnosis of EGP a took about 15 months the adult started when I was 46 was about 15 months later that all of these other things came into play well that's pretty common actually people there's often a gap between the asthma can be weeks can be months can even be years did you start having other manifestations of disease even after your first course neuropathy or polyps or things like that yes actually a few months after the asthma started I started having some sinus abnormalities and actually had a surgery to strip the sinuses which was unsuccessful and they couldn't figure it out why so I was seeing the in folks in ent at that point and then later I develop some sort of my hands and feet it didn't last neuropathy that we talked about yeah I think that's a type of symptom that we always want patients to report because it's often ignored or even by physicians and by patients and it's really important because fortunately in your case it didn't lead to other problems but sometimes it leads to more serious neuropathy and inability to move hands and feet properly so it sounds like you've been through quite a journey with your EGP a experience so they made a diagnosis and first of all how did you feel about that were you nervous were you anxious and then how did they treat you so I did my little bit of research and I was initially treated with corticosteroids followed by cyclophosphamate after about six months of that I was switched over to a safai brain and that treatment continued for quite a few years it wasn't until pretty recently and switched to mycophenolate so tell me why did they switch you and tell us about your experience with the initial treatments with the steroids with the cyclophosphamide with the Azoth IRA Prynne tell us that you know the good the bad the ugly about those treatments there's a long so the prednisone starting with that there were a lot of side effects there was weight gain I developed that lovely facial hair long time were you worried about your bones a good question yes yes so I have developed osteopenia from the long term steroid use I do have a DEXA scan every other year to sort of monitor that so that was definitely a side effect the cyclophosphamate was really rough that was a very very rough six months I lost all of my hair so I was fat bald sweaty like crazy from prednisone ik resume and generally feeling terrible the ASA thiamine once I switched I didn't notice any side effects from that I think in my bloodwork there were some changes so the as you mentioned thankfully you're alive and you're doing quite well now it appears prednisone as we said it's the best drug we have is the worst trip we have would you agree that efforts to try to find new drugs to get people off prednisone is perhaps one of the most important things we could do for each of you absolutely what's been your experience since you've been on meppel ISM and how often do you take it and and have you tolerated it well I've very well I began in March of 2018 receiving and honestly I've not noticed any side effects but let's go see where did you start you know I I know I was at 80 at one point early in the journey you guys talked a little bit about people flaring particularly with asthma I do experience that several times a year some has have been better since the new medication treatment it has though I that seems to be my the weak link for me I recently was exposed to some chemical fumes that caused a flare of asthma do you take your inhalers and I feel I never used the albuterol rescue inhaler but I do have the daily maintenance there yeah yeah so you've cut back on your steroid dose it sounds like your asthma is relatively well controlled but you still have some players and that's to be expected you know drugs are perfect in terms of limiting all manifestations and so those are some of the things that we're still working on in terms of doing our research to tell us a little bit about the impact that each EPA has had on your social life on your family life and your general day-to-day well-being and sort of a general malaise for children or so at the time of diagnosis which was almost 12 years ago now that was difficult because the the kids were pretty young so it took a toll on my family and you know but for now day to day I wish someone had told me at the beginning things were gonna get so much better because that's that's what we want I think that you've done very well you know the fatigue you mentioned is very common and I think we're learning research we and others have done this there's a lot of fatigue in patients with chronic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases that we need to pay more attention to as in medicine and patients and it's not all people who have depression or fibromyalgia syndrome other issues there's something probably inherent in the disease that's causing this and I think we're looking for treatments to be able to affect that as well Peter Linda thank you so much for joining us for this discussion today what we've discussed today is that a multidisciplinary team approach is essential and diagnosing agpa it's key to recognize the signs of EGP a and take note of heidi s NF L accounts and other important components of the lab workup and in collaborating in the treatment and long-term follow-up of patients with eg PA we hope you found this discussion informative and useful for your practice thank you so much for joining us today thank you for listening download materials and
