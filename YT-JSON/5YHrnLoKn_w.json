        "transcript": "what is Lang Chang why is it one of the fastest growing AI tools of all time and how can you use it to get ahead of everyone my name is David Andre and here is a simple introduction to Lion chain first off what even is Lang chain I think the best explanation is right in its name the Lang part stands for language which refers to the use of large language models like gpt4 from open Ai and the chain part stands for chaining or connecting these language models together basically Lang chain is a tool that makes it very easy to build new apps using existing AI models what's interesting is that link chain was actually made for people who have limited knowledge in the AI field so that literally anyone can build a new AI app by the way if you're finding value in this then please subscribe the timing of link chain was literally perfect it was launched in October of last year literally right before chair GPD was released so it is just 7 months old and even right now it works with many different services like Amazon web services is Google Cloud Microsoft Azure and much more and it can read over 50 different document types from PDFs to CSV files to Google Docs excels Microsoft docs anything link chain already has over 36 000 stars on GitHub which makes it one of the fastest growing AI projects ever not as fast as Auto GPD though despite being barely 7 months old the startup is already valued at over 200 million dollars with a 20 million dollar investment from Sequoia Capital which is one of the biggest VC firms in the world but that's not all a week after that 20 million dollar investment link chain has announced another 10 million dollar seat investment from Benchmark you know these guys are on fire so why is Lang chain so huge what problems does it solve the reason why link chain is important is because it Bridges the gap between existing language models like the ones from open AI or hugging face and external data sources to put it super simply it makes building new things with AI much easier some of the biggest benefits of land chain include components easy to swap and customize speed it's regularly updated and Community they have frequent meetups in real life on their Discord and also they host webinars all the time think of it like this blank chain allows you and me the everyday person to use these Advanced models like gpt4 or Lama and build new things with them like mobile apps website Services products anything you can imagine a very simple example I can give you is that with link chain you can build your own version of chegebt your own chatbot with your own data so let's say you have a lot of documents from work or school or your personal riding let's say you're an offer right and you want to train a new language model on your own data and create your own chat bot that you can ask questions to and it knows that data you know cheer GPT doesn't know what's on your computer but with link chain you can create your own chatbot that knows everything you wanted to okay so Lang chain is this new revolutionary technology but who is behind this who is the developer well his name is Harrison Chase and he's a Harvard graduate and let me tell you this guy is more excited about AI than just about anyone like if you want to get more hyped about the AI Revolution watch some interviews what he's doing with Lang chain is super smart it's like the picks and shovel strategy you know when when there was the gold rush in the 1800s the people who got the richest weren't the ones mining for gold it was the people who were selling picks and shovels and right now in the AI Revolution everybody is trying to create their own product you know their own tool there's like 1 000 new tools every week but his approach is different he built the framework for the people who are creating the tools to use so it's kind of Genius if you think about it the applications of link chain are literally endless and if you learn about Lang chain it will help you stay ahead of everybody else in the AI field and if you're interested in starting your own business with Lang chain I got some business ideas for you first off a customer service chatbot you can utilize link chain to connect it to something like zapier to create a new customer service chatbot now this could be for their own company or you can license this and sell this as software as a service you know success product now every single company basically needs a good customer service solution and it's only a matter of time before someone develops a product so good that everybody starts using it basically kind of like zoom zoom became so popular during the pandemic because it was a great product and everybody suddenly got the need to use it now the need for customer service is already there so if you build the customer service product that's great and that everybody uses you have a bright future ahead of you another business idea is to build a Content summarization tool maybe a Chrome extension or a website so let's say you take a really long book like an ebook or these you know Congressional bills that are endless and that use super complex words that nobody understands well guess what language models like gpd4 understand them very easily and they can summarize them very quickly the issue is though that right now you can't upload documents into jgbd and also gbd4 has a 32 000 token character limit that's the best model the base one is only 4 000 tokens which is like you know 3 000 words that's not a very long document but it if you use length chain you could split that on your PC into many parts feed that into gpd4 through link chain and let that summarize it for you or for somebody else which would be a pretty good business idea another huge application that I myself would definitely use is a personal assistant that's built on top of the productivity tools like notion todoist click up imagine you would have like a Chrome extension let's say that would see all of your tasks prioritize them automatically maybe group them together it would know your goals so it could eliminate the useless tasks and maybe create new ones if it sees some gaps their applications are literally endless and again everybody needs and wants a personal assistant it's just that the product isn't there yet so if you create a good personal assistant using land chain you'll make some big bucks one more business idea that has huge demand right now is resume analysis and job matching these large tech companies they have thousands tens of thousands of people applying every single month and they need an effective way to going through those applications so if you build a product that can go through applications not only effectively but also very formally that way you don't miss any great candidates if you pull that off you will immediately have an endless line of clients lining up your wanting your line chain product now hopefully you found some value in this if you did then please subscribe I want to get to 1000 Subs so I can monetize this Channel and maybe make some dollars from it as well"
