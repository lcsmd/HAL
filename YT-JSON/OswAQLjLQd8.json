Excel has been releasing hundreds of new features over the years, yet 90% of Excel users don't even know they exist. So let's go over 8 of their best new features. First up we have the navigation pane (also known as a table of contents). Second is the image feature, then the TOCOL formula, followed by the Search feature. In 5th, we have the checkboxes in Excel. Sixth is the python integration. Seventh is the textsplit formula and finally we have the Excel add-ins.\n\nLEARN:\n🔥Power BI for Business Analytics: https://www.careerprinciples.com/courses/power-bi-for-business-analytics\n📈 The Complete Finance & Valuation Course: https://www.careerprinciples.com/courses/finance-valuation-course\n👉 Excel for Business & Finance Course: https://www.careerprinciples.com/courses/excel-for-business-finance\n🚀 All our courses: https://www.careerprinciples.com/courses\n\nSOCIALS:\n📸  Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/careerprinciples/?hl=en\n🤳  TikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@career_principles\n🧑‍💻  LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/company/careerprinciples/\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\n\nChapters:\n0:00​ -​ Navigation (TOC)\n1:12​ - Image Import\n2:22​ - TOCOL Formula\n3:23​ - Search Feature\n4:10 - Checkboxes\n5:07 - Python Integration\n7:43​ - TEXTSPLIT Formula\n8:46 - Add-Ins",
        "transcript": "did you know there's a table of contents feature in Excel how about a Wikipedia addin where you can look for anything on the web well excel's been releasing hundreds of new features over the years yet 90% of excel users don't even know they exist so let's go over eight of their best new features first up we have the navigation pane which is basically a table of contents suppose you have a lot of different tabs like this Excel sheet which you can download for for free in the video description and we want to go ahead and make a table of contents we can simply use the default one by going to the view Tab and clicking on navigation you'll find it right here to the side and from there you can simply click on any of the sheets to navigate there within it you can see that you have some subcategories which are basically all of the specific data areas we can even find any hidden tabs like checkbox 2 over here which would we can't quite find down below and this is fully Dynamic so if I hit a plus there to create a new sheet you'll notice that it automatically shows up over here as well next up suppose I have a physical paper maybe that could be a book and I want to bring that into Excel well for that I could take a picture of it with my phone perhaps and from there go ahead and send it via email and eventually take it over to my computer to look something like this as you can see here it doesn't look too great it's got some shading and so forth but there is a way to import it in our Excel file all we need to do is head over to data from here go to from picture picture from file go ahead and find wherever it's located in my case it's in the downloads folder right here I can just click on insert and you'll notice that it starts to load up over to the side just give it a minute and now we we can just click on insert data there and just hit on insert anyways if we double click on it you'll notice that it has the full text copied and even though it has some typos like this over here it's done a reasonably good job as you can imagine this works for any image so it might be a screenshot from your computer or anything from your phone like I just showed number three we have the two call formula and this is great for merging multiple columns into one so let's take a look look at an example let's suppose that we have these five lists here and we want to convert it into a single list we can do that by hitting equals to call hit the top key there and the array is this whole area over here and then we can just close the parenthesis and hit enter it's that simple but you'll notice that some of the names are duplicated like Christian over here so what we can do is in front of that two call we can add the unique function hit the Tab Key there and simply close at the very end that's all we need to do and now we have all of the full list of unique names two call is for columns but there's also a sister formula which is equals to row which does the same thing but instead it's on a row basis as opposed to a column basis next up we have the search feature in Excel see when we take a look at the ribbon up over here there is so much information that but sometimes you might forget where things are located so suppose you want to do a conditional formatting but you're not sure if that's in the insert tab well you can just right click anywhere and up top you'll find the search the menus option and within it we can just look for conditional formatting and find it from here much like we could have if we went to the Home tab so this applies to any part of the ribbon I can go ahead and right click again and this time look for a chart and I'm going to get all of the chart options too if you thought the search feature was useful wait till we get to the addins at the end of the video but first let's go over excel's newest feature which are checkboxes so over here let's suppose that I have a project and I want to add a checkbox for each stage I can just go over to insert and all the way to the side click on checkbox this is still a feature that's being rolled out so some of you may still not have it now it just works like any other text so we can just drag it out like that and then drag it down all the way to the bottom there if we want to have him ticked we can just hit on that space sign and space sign again to untick I can also change the colors and maybe put them out in Orange just to see what that looks like there this type of feature is really useful for creating a project tracker like this one over here where for each stage this tracker moves up and so does the number if we get to the full completion there you'll notice that it gets tied out as well and we made a full video on this up over here in number six we have probably the most powerful new feature which is python inside of excel so over here you can see that we have some stocks of companies and their dates let's suppose that we want to analyze this further maybe try to find the average price the count of occurences and so forth we can do that by going over to the formulas Tab and you'll find this python area over here again this is also a feature that's being rolled out now to activate it we can just actually go to equals and type py for creating python formulas hit the top key there and from here what we want to do is select the whole area so control shift down control shift right and I'm just going to put the Scribe there at the very end open and close the parenthesis and we can't just hit enter that only creates new lines here in Python so just go to controll enter it should take a while to load and you're going to see this data frame to make it into an Excel value just click up over here and click on Excel value now you can see what that looks like and we have the full breakdown for any kind of Statistics we could also change this to try to see the relationship between these formulas so instead of going to do describe we could put do core for correlation hit controll enter again now you can see that Microsoft to Microsoft is perfectly correlated obviously as it's the same company Apple to Microsoft is pretty similar as their competitors but companies that are non-competing like Walmart and Microsoft have a negative correlation so when one goes up the other one goes down speaking of stocks if you want to break into any of these Finance careers you can consider checking out our complete finance and valuation course where you learn all the essentials of accounting Finance valuation and financial modeling on Excel in the course we'll first cover financial statement analysis after which we'll get into Financial modeling through a three statement model on Apple then we'll begin the valuation phase where you learn to do a discounted cash flow a comparable companies valuation and a precent transactions valuation on adobi looking at the real financial statements to eventually theive evaluation range lastly we'll show you how to present an investment thesis using a stock page format so if you're interested in these check them out in the link in the description below all right back to the video next up we have the tech split formula which is fairly self-explanatory you can see over here that we have the career principles courses and suppose that we want to split them with that comma into each specific cell so we could do equals text split hit the top key there and this is the text comma and the delimiter is the separator so we want to separate it by a comma we'll put that in quotations there close the parenthesis and hit enter you can see how that looks like but suppose we want it to be vertical instead of horizontal we can change that with the transpose formula so equals transpose select this area here close the parenthesis and hit enter now you can see that it's made a vertical the transpose formula basically changes from horizontal to vertical or vice versa sisters to the text split are the text before and the text after obviously they're fairly self-explanatory too finally in number eight we have addins which I think is one of the coolest features for these just head over to the Home tab and you should find all the way to the side this addins icon click on that and from here we can pretty much add in anything so let's click on plus get addins this is going to open up the store here and from here we can add a ton of free plugins let's go ahead and add wikipedias hit on continue there and you'll find it over to the side where you have Wikipedia as a reference and suppose we want to know the population of France I'm just going to search for that and hit enter there so if we go over to sections this is going to give us the table of contents of the Wikipedia page we can click inside of overview and you can see that we have the population right here we can just select that and just hit on that plus sign that's basically going to import it inside of excel here as you can see as a value we can go ahead and delete the source if we just want the number for example and we can also add things like images by going to the image tab let's suppose that we like this one right over here we can simply drag and drop it to what I just showed you is one add in but as you can see there is a ton of different ones so feel free to play around and check them out awesome now you've just learned eight new Excel features very few people know about now to learn how to make some awesome visuals check out this video over here or take our Excel course
