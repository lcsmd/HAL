        "transcript": "hey guys crypto Dad here and today I'm going to show you how to install and run auto GPT so let's get started [Music] so Auto GPT is an open source software package that you can download and run on your computer that extends the capabilities of chat GPT and I wanted to give a step-by-step tutorial designed specifically for Windows users and I'll show you every step of my process and make it really easy for you now before we get into it too far I just want to point out that auto GPT is not going to make coffee for you in the morning and tuck you in bed at night it is groundbreaking software it is Cutting Edge software but it is not perfect and it's not going to do everything for you so keep that in mind as we work forward there's going to be a little bit of ambiguity and a little bit of troubleshooting that you're going to have to do along the way now in order to get all of this done you're not going to need to know how to code you're not going to have to write any code but you are going to need to configure a development environment and download some code and run it you are going to need also to configure the environment variables and I'm going to show you how to do that so don't worry and then once we're done I'll show you how to train the AI a little bit to get what you need done so don't forget to stick around for that and if you haven't done so yet don't forget to like And subscribe to my channel all right now a few little caveats I want to get out of the way I'm going to give you a brief overview of what I'm going to do now the three apis that I'm going to do for you today are the open AI API the Pinecone API which extends the memory capabilities a little bit gives it a place to store things and then the Google API will help you with some interfaces to Google searches and don't worry about all these websites I'm going to have links for everything down in the description below alright so open AI is the company that makes uh chat GPT and this is where we're going to get our API that we're going to need to access their services you can create a standalone account or you can sign in with your Google account once you've got yourself signed in and got an account you can go over here to view API keys right and this is where you're going to create an API key all you have to do is click this little button here and say create new secret key give it a name all right and once you get this key you want to copy it into your clipboard and save it somewhere I've got a little folder on a flash drive that has all of the API keys that I created right so you want to make sure that you put them somewhere safe and don't reveal them to anyone else now another thing you'll need to do with your API key for open AI is set up billing right if you go over here to billing you want to set up a payment method now it's not really that expensive but you do need to do this because if you're only using the free account the API is only going to allow you like three calls a day or something like that it's not going to be very useful at all so you'll want to set up a payment method with a debit or a credit card and then you can set your usage limits as you can see here here there's a hard limit default of 120 dollars per month you can take that down to fifty dollars whatever you want to do and then there's a soft limit that will give you an alert when you're getting close so that you don't have to like just completely stop what you're doing right so uh set those up for yourself along with your API key now the next API key that I'm going to show you is Pinecone now uh pine cone gives you the ability to sign up for a free account so far I've been able to use pine cone for free and haven't had any problems yet they've got a little alert there for auto GPT users it looks like the paid plans are more for advanced users right so you should be able to use the API right and all you have to do is create an API just like we did before now uh when when you create this API there are a couple of things you need to save and you know you can show this value or just copy it into your clipboard but just remember you'll also need this environment variable right which won't get copied when you click this so make sure you copy that as well and save it somewhere safe all right and then the next one is the Google API Google API is accessed through the Google Cloud console I'll put a link to that down in the description below what you want here uh for Google is the Google custom search API down here you can look for it up here too all right you just want this one you'll want to enable this once you've enabled it you'll want to go over here to credentials and then create an API key you want to copy that into your clipboard and save that somewhere in addition to the API key you'll also need a Google custom search engine I'll put a link to this down in the description you'll basically just hit get started you'll give it a name doesn't really matter what you name it you'll want it to search the entire web you'll fill out the captcha hit create and then you'll have this code here now you can grab the entire thing and save it over in your little text file but really the only thing you're going to need is this like little number here when we start configuring let's get those Dev tools installed all right so the first thing we'll do is python we'll need python because the code is written in Python so we'll definitely need python we can go over here to downloads and just click python the latest version of python we'll save that right and then also we're going to need the visual studio code which helps with our when we're editing our configuration file and we'll just drop that in our downloads folder we'll need GitHub desktop and just drop that in our downloads folder and for git we'll do a 64-bit get for Windows and we'll need docker we'll just click that download drop it in and the uh install Linux for Windows WSL we'll be able to do that in the command line when the time comes all right so let's go to our downloads folder and we'll start with python just double click now we want to make sure that we tick this off this is very important you're going to run into some error messages if you don't have python added to your path environment variable on your computer so it's very important you tick that off before you go click install now let that get installed all right and there we go we can close that out let's go ahead and do the visual studio code get that installed I just like to tick everything off just uh can make sure all your bases are covered maybe a little Overkill but there's nothing more frustrating than getting some cryptic error message for something that's not connected or whatever you can go ahead and launch it if you want to but we don't need it at the moment all right and I'll do GitHub for desktop if you have a GitHub account you can sign yourself in if you want it's totally free you can skip that as well and there we go that one's ready we'll go ahead and install git for Windows which is kind of the uh this is kind of the command line version and as I said the auto GPT sort of wanted to make use of it down the road so a good idea to just make sure everything's proactively installed most of these you can just use the defaults it's fine these are already ticked and I ticked these off just to be on the safe side it's up to you if you want to read all this carefully that's entirely up to you I just want to get you up and running with all the info with all the tools that you're going to need all right that's done we'll need Docker also now uh we're not going to be using Docker to actually download images and uh run using Docker but as I mentioned the uh Auto GPT uh actually writes code on its own as it's doing things and at one point it complained that it didn't have access to Docker functionality so I just installed this in case it needs it this takes a couple of minutes all right and there you go now we've got all our tools ready except for that Linux subsystem but I'm going to go ahead and get the auto GPT code downloaded to a local folder on our computer we'll go over here to the Repository and we can just copy this URL into our clipboard we'll go over here to GitHub for desktop what we want to do is clone a repository uh we're going to use the URL and we'll just paste in that URL now I don't like to use this folder I would just put it on my C drive right you can also click it like this you know and just click your C drive all right so the folder is going to reflect the folder that's on the GitHub we'll just click clone and then it's going to show it here and if you go over to your C drive you'll see that there is an auto GPT folder now if you click it there's a bunch of stuff in there right that's what we want now one little caveat that I ran into that I want to uh Pro preemptively show you so you won't get this error message is that the master branch is uh unstable right if they if you go down here they'll say don't use the master Branch use the stable Branch there's an easy fix for that using GitHub desktop you don't have to do any commands you'll just click here you want to search for stable so uh the the latest one just came out so just use the the base stable right and it just updates it for you right away and so now you're running the stable Branch instead of the main branch right really easy to do in GitHub for desktop right all right now that we've got the software installed Let's uh navigate over to that right if we go here to our PC we go to our C drive and just open up the auto GPT folder we're going to dive into the world of command line which I know can be a little scary uh but uh just bear with me I'm going to walk you through all of it now I'm going to give you a little Pro tip to open it in the correct folder so if you hold down your shift key and then right click in the window you'll get the option to open the windows Powershell here and if you do that you'll see that you're already in the correct folder so the first thing we'll do is get that Windows Linux system installed right it's pretty simple right just copy this command by clicking copy here go back over to your shell and you can do control V for paste and then hit enter all right in my case it's already installed so I don't have to do anything else but in your case you'll probably see a bunch of stuff flying by now the next thing we'll do is a command that I'll put down in the description pip is a little command that you can use to do some housekeeping in your python environment and what we want to do is download all the requirements that are needed if you look at this folder you can see that there is a file for the requirements so uh it's just going to read that file and install all of the necessary requirements for running this little program all right there it goes flying by as you can see a lot of mine are already installed and there you go all right and there we go now we can kind of minimize this let's go over to our code base the visual studio and let's go ahead and open up the software because we're going to have to do a little configuration now as I mentioned we're not going to need to write any code but we are going to need to do a little bit of configuration let's open folder here and we'll navigate to our C drive and just hit Auto GPT that's the folder right and then just select folder it's going to open everything up go ahead and Trust the authors now we don't need to do this right you can ignore this this little file here is the EnV template if we click here you'll see that they have uh it's it's pretty long and scary but there's only a few things that we need to modify all right this is just a template you'll notice that most of the items in the file are commented out and so most of these the defaults are just going to auto run when you run the program notice there's one here that's not commented out and that's your open API key we're definitely going to need that they've got some sections here for the pine cone and the Google that we downloaded if you recall write the Google apis so we'll get to those now before we do this we want to do a save as because this is just the template right and the program will actually be looking for a file called dot EnV not template so all we have to do is go up here to file choose save as and uh we'll just erase the template part right we just want it to be dot EnV and we don't want it to have an extension right so we'll just uh pull this down scroll down to no extension that's what we need a DOT EnV with no extension we'll click save and you'll notice that it appears over here on the side and it's got a little different icon now this is our environmental configuration file notice also that now that this file was not downloaded from GitHub we created it so once we have created this file and configured it and then we update the program like if later there's a newer version of Auto GPT and we pull down that version into our environment we won't overwrite this file right because this file is local to our computer and is separate from the code Repository but the code does look for it so we now we have it right so the first thing we'll do is grab that API from open AI as you recall uh it was a good idea to put them in a separate text file right this is our open AI key just highlight it copy it into our clipboard we can click and select here and just backspace and then hit Ctrl V and paste in that open AI key all right and then we'll go up here to file and choose save all right now really that's the only thing that we're going to need to run so at this point let's see if we can get it to run that's the important thing when you're configuring an environment so if you've downloaded and installed all of the items that I mentioned then this code should run for you in this ambiguous guide that they've given us uh this is the command that's going to make this thing work right the dot run dot bat if you look here in the file there's that the file is there in this folder right and if we go back to our Windows Powershell and do a dir command you'll see all of the files that we can see over here right we're looking at the same files all right and now we're ready to run it for the first time so uh just Ctrl V that command there and hit enter and boom it ran okay all right this is our goal this is what we wanted to see right now we'll hit enter and we can give it something to do so the version three is a little different than the previous version the previous version it asks you to give it a name and give it up to five goals this one is a little more open-ended you can kind of write anything you want um and just give it as much information as you can just as you would chat GPT you could say something like give me give me five home business ideas right just three little simple commands I'm just giving it something hopefully simple enough so that you can see this thing in action we'll hit enter here now uh note here that the memory type is local cache and the browser is Chrome right we're going to modify this a little bit so that we'll we'll be using the pine cone instead because that gives it a little more storage and uh we'll go ahead and put those Google apis in there as well but as it stands I just want to you to see how this works so as you can see here it uh it doesn't ask me to name it anymore doesn't ask me for the role and it doesn't ask me for the goals basically it just gives me this open-ended thing I won Auto GPT 2 and I gave it something right you can give it just about anything you want your imagination is your only limitation right so after it determines what you're asking it to do it comes out with a little plan here it says it's going to brainstorm gets a list of ideas you'll notice that it uh elaborated quite a lot on my little idea rather so you have to kind of sometimes you'll have to rein it in just a little bit sometimes it might do more than you really care for it to do uh but after it lists this out you can just uh you have these choices here yes to authorize uh Y dash n to run continuous command you can set it to continuous mode uh I I've tried to do it this way I've never really worked for me but there are some switches that you can use when you run it to use continuous mode I wouldn't recommend it um it's not it doesn't like I mentioned it's still experimental it uh it it does some things it's better to sort of coax it along yourself so uh and you will get tired of hitting y I'll tell you that right now you're going to kind of get tired of hitting y um and you're you'll get a little frustrated with it it's going to ask you way too many questions for what you consider as kind of a simple task depending on you know your needs but try not to get too frustrated I'll go ahead and hit Y here now you're going to see error messages as well it's kind of interesting the way that it works it'll say things like I'm going to do a little task and I'm going to run this little program that'll do this task for me right and then it'll say something like oh the program isn't there and so then it'll say now I'm gonna well I guess I need to write it so it'll write it so here it's talking about this command list in Json format it hasn't actually created it yet it's just referring to something that it hasn't created and so the next step will be oh well I better create this file so uh it's kind of interesting to watch the process of how it works but it will eventually get through the process it might run into errors too it might run into an error it tries to pull something off the Internet it's not what it needs and it'll say something like oh let me try a different way so you'll need to keep hitting y as it refines its methods and it will eventually become successful as it moves along so as and as you can see it's refining the ideas a little bit each time now to get out of it we can just hit n right and then it goes back to the command prompt now that we've seen it in action we know it's running everything's fine it's not giving you any error messages related to python or Windows or containers or anything like that because we've got all of the tools that it needs running in the background you might also want to go ahead and launch docker give it access to the docker environment yeah so this is one of those that I ran into we we do need to update the windows subsystem for Linux right let's just copy that into our clipboard right we'll go back over to our command line and just uh Ctrl V that in and let it run that update all right it didn't take long we can go ahead and run Docker now without any problems it hasn't really asked for access to any of the containers but it's good to have it sort of running in the background right in case in case it needs it now let's go back over here to our environment file and let's go ahead and add those other apis that we had in there scroll down here to the memory backend now notice here it gives us some instructions for setting up the memory back end we're using Pinecone so it mentions that you should use pine cone instead of local so we're going to uncomment this and we'll just write pine cone in here all right now we need to put in those pine cone apis that I we downloaded we can uncomment both of these notice the reason I'm using the visual code is because it makes it pretty clear what's going on as soon as you uncomment something the format changes so it kind of gives you some cues that things are going the way they should right so the API key here let's just erase that we'll go grab the key that we got from our that we got from Pine Cone you can right click and paste if you want to as well now that key and then the region erase that you remember that region field was at the front if you recall it looked like this right there's that region in the front there all right we'll just paste that in here and then we're done with that now we can also do the Google apis as well that will help it use Google a little bit smarter right these are the two Fields here we want the Google API key and we want the custom search engine so we'll erase both of these leave that equal sign there I've got my Google apis here paste will copy that into our clipboard and paste it in there right and as I mentioned you only need this little piece here for the custom search engine right you don't need this whole script all right we'll paste that in and there we go now I invite you to check this thing out there's all kinds of stuff that you could configure in here that you'll have to kind of do your own research for but uh you definitely need that open AI key and then I've added the pine cone functionality for increased memory storage and then the Google API the Google search API and the Google custom engine right make sure we say uh save so that it's saved and updated then we can go back here to our command line and hit the up Arrow to get the previous command hit up Arrow again to get back to this and then we'll hit enter and it's ready to go now it remembers the last thing it was working on so you can say yes to continue notice now that it's using pine cone memory right and it's using your Google Chrome browser for its searching I was doing that before but now it has access to a little more advanced search tools than just a regular search notice that when I restarted it it's kind of starting back from Square One so um that will happen but also recall that uh when as it's formulating its plan it starts referring to things that it hasn't written yet well if you've trained it through several iterations it should already have some code written from the first time so it will catch up a little quicker than as if it were working just basically from scratch but do remember that when you exit out and then come back in it'll remember the task but it'll look like it's starting from scratch but because it had written some stuff already it will catch up a little quicker than the first time so we can just hit yes now you will see this message occasionally um as I mentioned before uh the um just because you have a a chat GPT Plus account does not give you full access to the uh API keys right the API keys for chat gpt4 are completely separate we have a completely separate billing plan for those and I'm probably the API key that I generated here is probably not the gpt4 key right if we go back to the open AI page for a gpt4 they have this join API wait list so if you want the API the the latest API you can join the wait list so you will get this message occasionally even if you have the uh gpt4 API you will occasionally get this error message as I mentioned this thing is not perfect you'll see this message and then it'll continue on anyway I had it once uh tell me that it was going to use gpt3 and so I said okay fine you can also tell it to keep trying it's not perfect right all right so just keep hitting y now you can see that it did create a file that was written successfully right don't get upset if it gives you error messages because that's part of the process of writing code and programming you're always going to run into obstacles right but the great thing about Auto GPT is that it knows how to uh deal with the obstacles right right it's got some business ideas I need to conduct to conduct thorough research where is it writing all this stuff well you may ask right so let's go over and check in our uh Auto GPT folder if we scroll down here there's another folder called Auto GPT if we open that up they have this thing called Auto GPT workspace if we open that you can see here this is where it's storing the files notice it's written a couple little scripts and written out some business ideas right pretty cool right now it will expand on these right if we keep keep hitting yes it's going to keep expanding on this stuff and improving on it doing a lot of research so it's up to you how far you want to take it another thing that you can do it's got some ideas you can say something like I'm allergic like something like that right because you'll notice one of those ideas was pet grooming all right and then it's going oh okay I got some human feedback here what am I going to do with that so we'll see if it modifies that list with that particular information that I've given it also remember that you might get error messages you might see it kind of get stuck giving kind of in the same spot over and over again there are things you can do to help it along one of those is to copy any error messages that you're seeing in this window and pasting them over into chat gpt4 so for example I copied that error message into chat gpt4 and it gave me some information about why I might be getting that error message there are times where it will the the the AI will appear to be stuck and if you copy the error message that it's keeps spitting out you might figure out a way over here in your chat GPT to fix it all right so I've got you started I hope you'll uh use this wisely you might be saying to yourself this this little business plan that I'm asking it to create could have easily been been done over in chat GPT and I totally agree with you there I'm just giving you something that's very simple so that we can make sure that it's working we can see it in action there are there is additional functionality that will be added later there are already some plugins that you can get and install but I just wanted to get you started and get the environment set up make sure that it's running and play around with a little bit so I'll be doing some follow-up videos down the road when I discover some new functionality if you have any questions about anything I did please throw them up in the comments and I'll do my best to get them answered if you like this video give me a thumbs up if you'd like to subscribe to my channel I would appreciate it when you subscribe there's a little bell that you can click that will allow you to be alerted whenever I post new content once again thanks for joining me and hope to see you again soon"
