        "transcript": "perplexity AI is on a mission to redefine how you get accurate and reliable answers whenever you're searching for information perplexity AI dubs itself as an answer engine that uses large language models to deliver accurate answers to complex questions and in today's comprehensive tutorial I'm going to show you everything you need to know to make use of this pretty exciting and useful AI tool prepare to level up and let's get right into it head over to perplex it. just a note for this tutorial I'm going to be using perplexity Pro as from testing out the tool it became clear that the people that will benefit most from perplexity would likely be doing so in a professional or academic setting as we'll uncover throughout the video on the homepage you'll find a collapsible nav bar that contains additional links to the Discover page and your library all features I'll be going through today but for now let's learn by doing an ask ask perplexity a question when you click into the search box you'll be greeted with suggested searches that sometimes make for fun browsing on the internet and these are updated daily but for now let's ask it how x-rays work and just like that you greeted with a pretty comprehensive and seemingly factual answer despite the simple interface there is a lot going on in this page and let's take some time now to dive into the many features that really make perplexity shine as an answer engine at the very top you have the sources perplexity used to give you back your answer and if you'd like even more in-depth reading you can actually click into a source and read additional information there to the right of our answer you notice it also gave us images that help answer our question and there's also a search for videos feature and a generate image feature which we'll take a look at further on in the video now beneath our answer actually lies some pretty pretty powerful features first clicking the share button copies the link to this exact same thread what are threads you may ask every time you run a search in perplexity it creates a new thread which then gets added to your library as you can see on the left I'll dive more into the library in the next little bit supposing you didn't like the answer it first gave you you can actually just simply click rewrite and then select a different model this is a truly powerful feature as you're a to select models such as GPT 4 used in the latest chat GPT claw 2.1 B anthropic or Gemini Pro which was recently released by Google and still in beta so let's rewrite this answer using Claud 2.1 and see what we get and just like that we have a different answer so even though the facts about x-rays may still be the same across models each model has its own way of interpreting your question answering it and formatting it in a way it thinks May makes the most sense to the user and just a quick note to the right of your answer you will see what model is being used next is a seemingly simple but pretty powerful button The View sources button when you click view sources you once again are able to see all the sources referenced to give you your answer however in this case supposing I didn't want YouTube to be a part of the knowledge Source use I can simply delete YouTube from my sources click done and then perplexity will regenerate my answer omitting the YouTube Source pretty incredible and moving on from sources next is the copy button to Simply copy your answer to the clipboard and lastly the edit query button which simply lets you rewrite your original ask I'll cancel out of that for now and scroll all the way to the bottom of our answer to the related section as I mentioned earlier the related section really is a fun place to just go down rabbit holes off of knowledge for example you can then ask perplexity what are the different types of x-rays after which it goes on to give a good and well formatted answer on the several types of x-rays okay that was a basic overview of perplexity Ai and now let's dive deep into the search Focus Features to really start to unleash the power of perplexity Ai and see where it shines against tools such as Google search and chat GPT back on the homepage if you click Focus you'll notice there's six different Focus modes ranging from all to academic to writing wol from alpha YouTube and Reddit I am going to take the time to quickly go through each one of these as each really comes with its own set of unique differentiators and it's where perplexity seems to provide the most value for your money I'm also going to activate co-pilot which essentially helps you guide perplexity to the exact answers you're looking for and we'll get to see how it works throughout these examples so our first search about x-rays was using the All Focus mode as that is the default mode in the all mode perplexity searches the internet to provide you the best possible answer but now let's home into the academic Focus mode which is a specialized search within scolly articles and academic Publications I'll ask it what the most recent advancements in artificial intelligence in finance and then hit enter and then co-pilot steps in to guide us towards a more refined answer of course I can ask it to be Broad in the optional text field but for this case I'll tell it to zoom in on risk management and then it goes on to give us a pretty comprehensive answer on how AI has significantly impacted the field of risk management in finance covering areas such as AI integration in Risk Management processes explainable machine learning for risk management and so forth and you'll notice it even throws in a cautionary paragraph at the end letting us know that these advancements have the potential to revolutionize risk management and finance but they also come with challenges such as data privacy concerns Regulatory Compliance and ethical considerations really cool stuff okay next let's test out the writing mode the writing mode enables you to have a conversation and perform tasks with perplexity without it accessing the internet this is particularly useful when you're trying to generate code or pieces of text for this example though let's ask it to generate some code I'm going to ask it to write me a simple program in Python that counts the letters in someone's name co-pilot then steps into to ask us who will be providing the name us or the program itself I'm going to say it's going to be user input then hit send and in the blink of an ie you have a pretty simple but handy python script that can prompt a user for their name and then counts the number of letters in their name you also notice that it took the liberty to write the program in such a way that ignores any spaces in the user's name so it'll correctly count the letters in both single word names and multi-word names very handy indeed okay next is wolf from alpha the search Focus mode is designed for computational data and mathematical calculation I'm going to paste in an example I found from perplexity Ai and just like that it provides us an answer to help us solve the equation moving on let's try the YouTube search Focus this Focus mode allows for targeted searches within YouTube offering time stabs and options to watch videos in the platform so for example we can ask perplexity how to build a beginner gaming computer let's be honest with prices these days it's going to be over over $11,000 next it asks us what specific games or game genres we want to play on our computer I'm going to choose strategy games and simulation games and then hit send before we dive into the answer I'll take a moment to expand the co-pilot box just to give you a better sense of what it's doing in the background as you can see co-pilot took on inputs and then use those as keywords when it was searching YouTube for the best possible answer after which it then found 24 different sources to help provide our answer I can't even imagine how long it would have taken to go through each and every one of this videos and yet here we are just 10 seconds later and I'm no computer building Wiz but reading through the answer it genuinely does look like it knows what it's talking about and supposing you need more context you can simply click on any of the Little number icons which will take you to the video it reference to provide the answer really awesome stuff okay let's quickly look at the last Focus mode Reddit this mode focuses on Reddit discussions and opinions which of course there are plenty on Reddit but it does help provide a streamlined experience that filters out irrelevant content so for example supposing I'm researching reviews on the iPhone 15 Pro I can simply enter reviews on the iPhone 15 Pro in the Reddit Focus mode and for this one I'm actually curious about everything so let's select it all and perplexity then Scout was rdit to provide the consensus answer on the camera battery life performance design and price of the iPhone 15 Pro really handy okay so after that deep dive into the search Focus modes you are now while equipped to use perplexity for whatever task you have at hand next we're going to take a deep dive into the library and more specifically collections to see how you can easily stay organized in perplexity AI before we get though I will make a quick detour on the Discover page this page is so much fun as it is updated pretty frequently and allows you to discover search topics that are really really interesting to dig into and I would encourage you to use the Discover page as it does help you get more familiar and comfortable with using perplexity AI okay on the library page is where we'll find all those threads we just created you can imagine after using this tool for a bit you may have hundreds of thread threads so how do you stay organized well first things first you can actually easily click the three little dots and delete all threads not a bad goal when you just need a clean start sometimes clicking the plus icon actually allows you to start a new thread just as you would on the homepage now what things get really powerful is the collections feature so let's click get started I'm going to make a new collection for meal prep and I'm going to give it a food icon the the description is optional but I'm going to enter meal ideas for the week now this AI prompt sanction while optional is very very handy as allows you to give instructions to perplexity that affect every thread in that specific collection so think of this as custom instructions if you're more familiar with Chad GPT so I'm going to let perplexity know that it's a dietitian that's going to help me plan quick and easy to make nutritious meals before hitting create you can also decide the Privacy level of your collection either by making it sharable so you can easily share a link with friends and family or by making it secret I'll leave it chable for now and then click create and just like that my collection is now on the left so I'm going to go ahead and click into it and coming into the collection you can already see that it has some suggested questions for me which are actually pretty handy so let's take the first question for a spin what are some creative and nutricious meal prep ideas for breakfast lunch and dinner and pretty quick it gives us some seemingly easy to make breakfast lunch and dinner options very very useful and even at the end it goes on to say these meal prep ideas are not only nutritious but also convenient for those with busy schedules now I'll go back to my meal prep collection and give it a more complicated question and see what it comes up with I'll ask you to create a recipe that has 40 g of protein and 5 G of fiber using chicken and vegetables and also to make it spicy it then goes on to give me a recipe with ingredient list and the instructions to hit my desired macronutrient levels and as you can see at the botton it gives us a nutritional information summary of The Recipe now for this recipe let's try generate an image for it and see what comes up so I'll hit generate image and then choose the photograph style wow this is not a bad image at all and if you squint your eyes hard enough in the bottom right corner you will see the little AI emblem noting that this image was generated by AI just a heads up there are a couple times where I try generate images in here and they don't really turn up so your mileage may vary with this feature also just to note perplexities image generator really isn't meant to be used like tools such as Dary and mid journey and is more so meant for situations like this where you'd like to add a bit more context to your answer okay heading back to our library supposing I wanted to create a new collection to store some of the other threads we done today well that's very easy to do once again we just hit the plus sign next to collections and then enter our details you can simply click the three dots on the bottom right of any thread click add to collection and then select the collection you'd like to add it to at the time of recording threads can only be in one collection at a time okay moving on perplexity does a great job of reading files and images so let's go through a couple examples to show you what I mean we'll start by uploading this picture and then asking perplexity AI to describe the image and this is pretty wild it correctly identifies that there are four individuals gathered around wooden table in the picture it also lets us to know that there's a m wearing a beanie and glasses sitting in the middle and goes on to further describe the features of everyone else in the picture it then goes as let us know what's on the table such as a red cup a blue cup a glass jar with a spoon and what seems to be a sugar container absolutely wild now just for a bit of fun I am curious to see what happens when you click generate image from an image so let's try that and choose the photograph option once again okay so this is both hilarious and absolutely creepy it made a picture of four people sitting on a table but they do seem to be a bit possessed anyway moving on let's upload a CSV file to perplexity and ask it to summarize it for any insights now the CSV file contains a ton of Hotel data so the co-pilot steps in and asks us what it is exactly that we'd like summarize I'll tell to summarize book patterns and general Trends it then proceeds to give us a pretty comprehensive overview of our uploaded file for example column six lets us know that most bookings are for one or two adults with children and babies being less common now of course this is just a tip of the iceberg and the purpose of this really is to show you the capabilities and not run a comprehensive data analysis so now at this point you should be pretty well equipped to do some pretty incredible stuff in perplexity Ai and more specifically perplexity Pro if you have it with that said let's head over to our profile settings to go through some Advanced but pretty handy features on your account page you can actually select the AI model you would like perplexity to use as a default so the default model is of course the one provided by perplexity which is pretty fast however if you have a preference such as gp4 or claw 2.1 or even Gemini you can easy say ected from this screen here and all your future searches will be using that model by default the next handy feature here is if you switch to your profile tab you can also give it custom instructions that the AI should know and once again if you use chat GPT this is akin to the custom instructions there as an example I'll let it know that I'm someone that prefers brief and well structured answers in a bullet point format and you know what I will enter my location as the suggested location Boulder Colorado and then hit save when you do that followup questions are then B into the mix for example It'll ask you about your professional skills your favorite outdoor activities and stuff like what kind of music you like these questions are designed so that perplexity can get a better understanding of the type of answers it thinks you would like to see the most however you don't have to fill out any of this information and you can easily skip it just to note if you do enter anything here it does affect all your new threads so sometimes I'd say it's better to use collections versus This Global setting but your mileage may vary let's quickly take our new settings for a test drive and I'll ask it to describe how satellites work and as you can see for such a pretty broad topic such as how satellites work it gave me a pretty brief and well structured answer in bullet point format exactly what I asked for for and to turn off the custom instructions you can simply go back to your profile and then hit clear or you can also hit pause at the top of the page before we touch on some prompting tips I'm going to take just a quick minute to head over to the playground this is pretty much just a fun place where you can have a conversation with different AI models both from perplexity and other providers so for example you're using perplexity default 7B online model I'm going to ask it to tell me about the Matrix and just like that it gives us an answer but supposing I prefer to use another model let's pick llama 2 and ask the same question and see what sort of answer we get there as you can see llama provides a more essay type response where perplexity provided a more straights the point and business-like answer really really cool okay let's look at some prompting tips for this section I'm actually not looking to reinvent the wheel and perplexity actually recently released a very handy blog on some prompting tips so I will just take a moment to walk you through that first of all the anatomy of a prompt The Prompt should seamlessly blend your goal and background into an easy to read sentence it should contain keywords which better guide perplexity to give you the right answer and the formatting is important aspect to give you good results so for example supposing you're using perplexity for market research you can let it know that your a product manager and need a summary of market trends for electric bikes in the US and in this case the keywords perplexity picks up most on are market trends electric bikes the US and product manager they then have a few other examples on the page so for example supposing you're student writing an essay you can then let it know that you're student aiming to excel in your psychology paper and need an essay outline on the effect of social media on Mental Health with your keywords in that ask being essay outline social media mental health and students very very handy resource if you'd like to read this more in depth I will link it down below as is a great resource to help you structure your prompts depending on your goal awesome job making it this far in at this point you should now be able to save hours of your life from trudging through horrible search results on Google and being able to use perplexity to get the answers you need in a fraction of the time in terms of some key takeaway perplexity is an answer engine and not a search engine or even chatbot so you kind of do have to approach this a bit differently than You' approach Google or even chat GPT perplexity seems to be more accurate with academic and factual information and is a great resource for those type of settings when using this AI tool make sure you choose the right Focus mode to really increase your efficiencies also use collections to stay efficient and organized I have hear how you've been using perplexity AI or perplexity Pro down in the comments below thanks for watching and catch you the next one"
