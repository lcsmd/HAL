        "transcript": "what is a server how do you define a server if you're talking about what can host files what can host Services what can host websites or media then a server is just a computer that sends electrical signals to be interpreted by another computer do you believe a computer being rack mounted or made for Enterprise has anything to do with its ability to run hosting software do you think that's air you're breathing now today I'm going to answer what defines a server or a Nas or a it's time to free your mind but I can only show you the door you're the one that has to walk through [Music] it welcome back to craft Computing everyone as always I'm Jeff today I'm going to attempt to answer a question I've received received on nearly every single video I've ever posted about server hardware and that is what is a server how do you make a server and what Hardware should you use to build a server but more specifically why you don't necessarily need server Hardware to start learning about servers and why building a home lab can be done with literally any hardware you might already have at home broadly speaking there are two terms that we're going to be defining today what is a server and what is a client the way I like to think about it is this a server is any piece of Hardware or software that hosts content for other systems a client is any piece of Hardware or software that consumes that content and it's possible for any hardware or software to be both at the same time great we are 60 seconds into this one and I'm already muddying the waters when most people think of the word server they picture a server rack filled to the brim with Intel xon and AMD epic CPUs with multiple dozens of CPU cores each hundreds of gigabytes of memory hundreds of terabytes of storage fans whirling at 15,000 RPM that image isn't incorrect but Hardware isn't what technically makes something a server it's the software that those systems are running as I said a server is just a piece of Hardware or software that hosts content for other systems what Hardware that's running on really doesn't matter I'm trying to free your mind to demonstrate what I'm talking about I'm going to show off some different hardware and software configurations with the allnew zema blade so consider this my review view of this product zema did send out the zema blade along with some of the expansion cards that I'll be using today and I'll be using some of them to demonstrate different concepts when building a server a gaming PC a client a Nas a router or anything else that you can possibly think of like I'll reviews no money changed hands zema has no input over the content of this video nor will they see it before it goes Live on YouTube the zema blade is the latest Mini PC from Zab board formerly known for their Zab board mini PCS and in fact I have one of the those right over here but I guess we're going to have to refer to these as the Zab board Zab boards from now on if you wanted to name both the make and the model but I digress there are two different models of the zema blade to choose from and unlike previous models the zema blade uses an LP DDR3 so dim memory slot rather than soldering the ram to the board making them considerably more affordable than the previous model both models come with the zema blade Mini PC itself along with the plastic and aluminum enclosure a USBC cable and power brick for providing power to it as well as a SATA cable for plugging in a SATA drive now just like the previous generation Zab board I hate the decision to only include the single SATA adapter as they sell the Dual SATA adapter for $10 and it's a proprietary cable that's required to use both SATA ports that are on the zema blade so this should be included by default as there's really no additional cost to produce this cable versus this cable it's just an extra $10 money grab the zema blade 3760 comes equipped with an Intel Apollo Lake Celeron n3350 it's a two core two threaded CPU with a base clock of 1.1 GHz and a turbo of 2.4 GHz and it has a max TDP of just 6 Watts there's also the zema blade 7700 running an Intel Apollo L Celeron j3455 this one has four cores and four threads with a base clock of 1.5 GHz and a max turbo of 2.3 and a slightly higher TDP of 10 Watts now these are not the newest CPUs in Intel's lineup by any stretch of the imagination first debuting all the way back in 2016 but it's hard to argue with the price point the zema blade was able to hit by using them $64 for the zema blade 3760 and just $96 for the zema blade 7700 even the dual core n3350 is faster than the quadcore Raspberry Pi 4 and considering that it also includes the case a heat sink and power delivery even after you add an 8 GB stick of memory it actually winds up being cheaper as well both models of the zema blade dropped the Dual ethernet of the zma board in favor of a single gbit ethernet port and I think that's actually the right move to bring costs down overall at retail both support up to 16 gbt of lpddr3 and come equipped with 32 GB of emmc on board for installing your OS both CPUs are also equipped with Intel hd500 graphics and support quicksync video encoding as well as decoding there's also a piece Express 2.0 X4 expansion for adding pretty much anything you can plug into them from Storage controllers to network cards to video cards turning these single board computers into well a client for consuming content or a server for hosting it to Define what a server is let's talk about different types of servers along with the PC that prompted this entire video subject the auar nas router Mini PC what makes it a Nas what makes it a router and what makes it a Mini PC the honest answer here absolutely nothing but the name which is entirely marketing jargon the AAR is a Mini PC in that it's smaller than average form factors it has two SATA drive Bays on top meaning you can put two drives into it it's being named for the feature set and a possible use case that the manufacturer intends and that's not uncommon in the PC World Nvidia has their GeForce lineup which is designed to play games but nothing stops those cards from running CAD or encoding video streams the only thing required to make something a Nas is the ability to store files and share those files over a network do you know what makes a PC capable of being a Nas literally any PC today that has storage and network connectivity a gaming PC running Windows can host files for other PCS if you've ever set up a share folder you've created a server a Raspberry Pi can be a nass you don't even need to attach hard drives to it just share the files directly off of its micro SD card it doesn't have redundancy it's not fast but it's technically a nass if it's hosting files technically if you've ever copied files from your smartphone onto your PC over Wi-Fi your phone was acting as a Nas both models of the zema blade have two SATA ports right here on the front and you can buy this handy little $10 adapter to plug in both drives at the same time now Zemo will also sell you a little Drive chassis so you can hold two hard drives and the Zemo blade just kind of sits right here onp top it's not elegant it's not pretty but make no mistake about it this still qualifies as an assass if you hadn't caught on by now a Nas Is defined by the software that a server runs not the hardware that it's running on running a Nas I will typically install true Nas it's an operating system that makes it easy to configure your storage devices set up file shares configure share permissions and Keep Storage secure either through raid redundancy or by setting up backups so if you've been paying attention what makes devices like the recently reviewed AU star or the zema blade a Nas device the fact that you can load up a hard driver to and run software that lets you share files it's as simple as that how large of a Nas you want to build is completely up to you and as you can see from builds I've done before the sky is the limit as far as scale is concerned now while the zema blade does have two SATA ports it may not be enough capacity for critics out there and you know who you are to consider it a Nas device to that I say this is an as media 1166 and it's a 16 Port SATA controller on a PCI Express card and if you watch carefully I'm going to transform this zema blade into a 16 Bay Nas server like that this generic PC is now something that's capable of controlling 16 SATA drives boom now it's a Nas although you're going to need to figure out how to power all those drives since the zema blade won't provide enough power to 16 hard drives but it's capable of it now another term that gets thrown around when talking about servers is routers in fact it's one of the terms I see most often on many PCs that are sold on Amazon but as we learned with nas the hardware requirements of a router are quite simple if you break them down according to the Oxford dictionary definition a router is a device that forwards data packets to the appropriate parts of a computer network that's it as far as how a router is used we're typically talking about an incoming internet connection and distributing that out to client devices over a network at a basic level that means we need two Network ports one for the incoming internet connection and a second one for the internal facing part of the network so by that definition any computer with dual network ports that can run routing software can function as a router as far as software goes typically pfSense or open sense are what I see running in the wild if you're not doing anything exotic with traffic routing or rules the dual core Celeron n3350 is likely enough for routing gigabit internet in a home or small business environment but darn the zma blade only has a single gigabit Ethernet port well this is a four port 2.5 GB ethernet controller on a PCI Express card and if you watch carefully I'm going to transform the zema blade into a four port router just like that now the zema blade has enough Network ports to be considered a router so long as you can install the software to make it all work so I've been talking about what makes a server a server but what if we talk about clients for a second again my definition of a client is any piece of Hardware or software that consumes content that can mean accessing a website from a PC makes it a web client watching a video makes it a media client playing a game makes it a gaming client and if anyone knows anything about playing games on Hardware not traditionally used in gaming the very first video I ever published to this channel was about using decommissioned server hardware for gaming and I think it's really here that I can drive the point home that Hardware has little to no bearing over the function of a PC while Zeon CPUs were sold as server CPUs and they were never intended to be used in gaming there's also nothing stopping them from running games most of what separates server CPUs from conserver CPUs is marketing along with some features that might help specific use cases more cores for servers and higher clock speeds for consumers for example but there's nothing that prevents a server CPU or GPU from playing games or a consumer CPU from hosting files and serving up media now I'm not going to connect an RTX 4070 TI to the zema blade until you now it's a gaming PC as that's too impractical even for me but what is a gaming PC by definition it's any computer that can play games and those games don't have to be modern one of my favorite gaming computers that I've built over the last couple years you actually never saw the final version of it's my retro rocket and it's currently running a Sandy Bridge i7 8 GB of ddr2 a 512 GB SSD and an Nvidia gt740 graphics card so modern games are pretty much a no-go but I built this PC to run Windows XP and my collection of retro games from the late '90s and early 2000s meaning it's actually overkill for its intended purpose again the least practical use case of the zema blade is going to be as a dedicated gaming PC although at $64 the dual core Celeron model can run every 8bit through 64-bit console out there making it an excellent emulation PC also a lowow PC running something like Zoran Os or Chimera OS would make an excellent retro PC console as well running PC games from the late 90s and early 2000s on a modern Linux operating system through the help of proton and wine the zema blade is a fantastic low power PC and its use case is as wide as your imagination is but the same can be said about any computer PC parts are nothing more than Lego for computer nerds and that's really what this video is meant to be about getting outside the bounds of what makes a server or a PC or a Nas or a router or even a gaming PC when we're talking about x86 64 PC Hardware they're all capable of running the same software there's nothing stopping you from installing Windows on a oneu Zeon server and playing games or from installing proxmox on a zema blade and running virtual machines some Hardware is better suited for specific tasks but they're all based on standards which means Hardware is pretty much interchangeable in PC Building it seems there are an infinite number of Unwritten rules around what Hardware can do certain things we make rules for PC Building around what type of cooler to use what graphics card to install and what software you should run what you must learn is these rules are no different than the Lego I was just talking about some can be bent others can be broken let's start broad with the topic gaming enthusiasts love to make up rules for cooling a consumer motherboard in CPU needs either a large air cooler or some form of water cooling servers require high air flow and massive amounts of static pressure the zema blade is a proper PC running an Intel x86 64 CPU but it only runs at 10 watts and it doesn't even have a proper heat sink the CPU die is actually directly touching the aluminum back panel here with a thin layer of thermal paste in between them there 's no heat sink fins on this there's no fan yet this PC is able to stay completely cool and quiet a top flat gaming PC with a 250 watt CPU and a 600 watt graphics card needs as much cooling and performance as you can possibly provide that means a mesh front panel to maximize air flow proper orientation of all of your components to prevent hot spots or heat bleed from one component to another you need to even out the distribution of intake and exhaust fans to have a slightly positive pressure inside your case maintaining air flow while also minimizing dust buildup of course a 65 wat CPU and a 75 wat graphics card can run in cases with little to no air flow as there's just not as much heat to pull away from the system do you remember my Xbox One S PC case mod where I stuffed a computer inside of an Xbox One S that's a 65 watt CPU and a 70 wat GPU and it runs perfectly cool and quiet all the time with no case fans whatsoever around Mount to you server that draws 1,000 Watts needs 12 fans at 15,000 RPM to push as much air as possible through the chassis humidity in a server room needs to be kept in check at between 40 and 50% to prevent static buildup on components due to the insane volume of air that's moving through the server cable management on both sides of a rack can inhibit air flow and must be kept in check with all those fans vibration damping needs to be considered to avoid damage to hard drives of course I also have a complete completely full server rack full of equipment but my entire rack is drawing around 400 WTS in total right now my main file server is currently running a thread Ripper 2950x a workstation CPU that doesn't even have ECC memory installed and my two VM hosts are rocking tiger like mobile CPUs on eering motherboards that I sourced from AliExpress how many of those server and airflow rules do you think apply to my particular use case my VM servers have two 80 mm fans at the front and Intel box cooler on the CPU and no exhaust fans and they run perfectly fine along these same lines there are Unwritten rules for Server software and Hardware configurations for example I've heard time and time again that real Tech Nicks are absolutely terrible for routers and make sure you have either Intel or broadcom if you run a file server you have to run ECC consumer Hardware isn't meant to run 24 hours a day 7 days a week like it is in servers if you want to run servers at home while it's fun to get into us Enterprise Hardware server racks and all of the fun stuff that I get to play with around here there's also nothing stopping you from using something else for the same purpose your home router isn't slinging enough data to overwhelm a real technick ECC only protects your data in Flight before it's even written to disk and file transfers in pretty much every OS have check sums to verify data Integrity on both ends unless you're running a multi-terabyte SQL database in your home lab with hundreds of simultaneous connections and clients ECC offers is little to no extra protection for your Plex library and finally the reason I brought all this extra Hardware onto the desk with me today is that I've ran everything from raspberry pies to used Enterprise gear to Orange pies with an RK 3588 to risk 5 to AliExpress motherboards to literally brand new Intel Zeon and AMD Epic Systems in my server rack and none of it ever has had a problem running 24/7 dutifully serving whatever content that I've asked of it it the rules that we place on Hardware typically come from the top ends of our experience and expectations if you have 500 clients hitting a file server you'd better have ECC in that box if you have an RTX 490 in your gaming PC I'd recommend water cooling and a mesh front at the front of the case but those rules don't apply to every single situation and every single PC build that's ever been done and the further down the power band you get the less the rules apply see the passively cooled zema Blade with a PCI Express card that hangs off the side so what makes a server a server you do well more technically the software does but it's whatever you do with it it's the same thing that makes any pile of Parts into a gaming PC a router a Content Creator's workstation a retro gaming machine or a storage server if you're trying to get into running servers yourself ignore the rules ignore the redditors ignore the noise and the gate Keepers go out and build something cool from whatever parts that you have available install proxmox or unraid or trass or rocky Linux or xcp and G the point of this hobby is to experiment not to just do what everyone else expects you to do with the hardware that you have if you're interested in the zma blade as a fantastic starting point to a home lab or a client PC they are available for pre-order right now over on crowd Supply the dual core Zemo blade 3760 will run you $64 while the quad core Zemo blade 7700 is priced at 96 units won't currently ship until January 2024 so you'll have plenty of time to plan out your low power build links on where to find them are all down in the video description you know what else is down in the video description links to craft

the next video cheers guys [Music] here for today is from leion Brewing up in Seattle Washington it is the full contact hazy Imperial IPA clocking in at 88.8% this also comes in a 19.2 oce can which means it's good for two things degreasing engines and killing brain cells so the alian full contact Imperial IAL hazy IPA I got to say this is one of the least hazy hazy ipas I've ever had but that said hazy has evolved more from a stylistic choice as far as Aesthetics goes and developed into a full flavor profile and as far as the flavor Elion absolutely nailed this one it is citrusy and hop aggressive right up front the first thing you get is is like orange lemon peel maybe a little maybe a little zest of some kind uh and it's super super dry and that actually makes way to a pretty decent and Rich malt profile on the back end of this and again it it's a very dry beverage which leaves you wanting more or wanting to pair it with uh a barbecue bacon cheese cheesburger or a greasy slice of pizza like this is a fantastic beer to pair with the worst bar food you've ever had and by worst I mean best follow the White Rabbit and go pick one of these up"
