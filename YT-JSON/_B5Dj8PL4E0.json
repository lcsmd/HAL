        "description": "I make animations in biology with PowerPoint, this animation video is about Maxam–Gilbert DNA sequencing method, which based on nucleobase-specific partial chemical modification of DNA and subsequent cleavage of the DNA backbone at sites adjacent to the modified nucleotides.\n\nPCR can be used previously to amplify the DNA.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nif you like this animation video hit like and subscribe for more.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
