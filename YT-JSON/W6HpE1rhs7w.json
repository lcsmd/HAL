        "transcript": "foreign well thank you very much 60 Minutes is happy to be here this week on 60 Minutes we're going to look into the amazing world of artificial intelligence we are being shown astounding new technologies you're looking at one of them right now that's not actually a picture of me that is a computer representation of me in three dimensions it's a new kind of technology that will allow people to feel like they're in the same room together what is the point of all this but I hope it makes it feel like you and I are completely together no matter where we are in the world Andrew narker showed us a prototype of project Starline an AI video conferencing experience Google is developing it's not a picture of you it's essentially you I'm now on the other side of the building but this Magic Window makes it feel like we're exactly together again the sense that I have sitting here is that I could just reach right out and take that out of your hand Google allowed us inside its artificial intelligence laboratory hey Scott welcome to Google and we also had a rare interview with Google's CEO Sundar pachai what do you compare AI to in the course of human civilization you have always thought of AISD most profound technology humanity is working on more profound than fire or electricity or anything that we have done in the past why so it gets at the essence of what intelligence is what humanity is you know we are developing technology which for sure one day will be far more capable than anything we've ever seen before for me the most amazing thing that I saw at Google was their barred chat bot we played with a famous six-word short story often attributed to Hemingway for sale baby shoes never worn wow the only prompt we gave was finish this story in five seconds holy cow the shoes were a gift from my wife but we never had a baby they were I had a little bit of an emotional reaction when I was working with Bard because I had the sense that I was meeting an intelligence that I had never conceived of and an intelligence that I was sure that I would never understand I can totally understand what you're talking about and I don't want to read too much into it today where the state-of-the-art technology is we are humans interacting with something which in some ways is mirroring Humanity back in certain ways what are the downsides I mean the downsides at some point does Humanity lose control of the technology it's developing control when it comes to disinformation and generating fake images we saw the potential with Google's AI that creates pictures out of words this is text in pictures exactly imagine Eli Collins is a vice president at Google you can generate a picture of pretty much most things you imagine I'm happy to put in a prompt if if you've got something let's try pink taxi cabs on Fifth Avenue all right pink taxi cabs instantly we saw a shade unknown on New York cabs we next Collins gave us a first look at an AI system Google has not released yet experimental text to video which instantly answered our prompt Golden Retriever with wings oh look at that as with Bard this has safety filters for example it doesn't create images of people every Google executive we talked to said that there is a pressing need for government to regulate this new frontier of artificial intelligence because it has the power to change just about all of our Lives to be clear this is going to be a cat and mouse game right people are going to use AI to be more sophisticated no different from how we have tackled spam and Gmail and we are constantly developing better algorithms to detect that they are spam we would need to do the same with deep fakes audio and video but over time look there has to be regulation you're going to need loss against there have to be consequences for creating deep fake videos which cause harm to society I don't usually hear CEOs of major corporations ask for government regulation anybody who has worked with AI for a while you know you realize this is something so different and so deep that you know we would need societal regulations to think about how to adapt the question of our age going forward is going to be whether these machine Learning Systems replace human capabilities replace human creativity we are only just now getting a sense of what they're capable of and so these are places where Society needs to get together and have a conversation what do we need these intelligent machines to do for us what do we prefer to do for ourselves and where do we place value"
