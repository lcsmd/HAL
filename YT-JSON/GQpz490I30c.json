        "transcript": "there's just a lot of TR now now now oh this one's definitely stumping it Tesla versus the pinata pinata one Tesla zero it does not see it it does not see it it's gonna go strong oh no all right so what did you think uh I feel like Size Matters that's what she said literally hey y'all it's Dr noit all we are going to do my leftand turn test on version 12.3.3 of full self-driving but misinformation here today D and then if things go well and she doesn't divorce me after this test we are going to try some objects because we purchased a bunch of stuff at Dollar General so many Dollar General items are putting their lives on the line for this testing today like a pinata and a ball and a very small stuffed animal and a wrapping P wrapping bubble wrap and stuff like that we've just got random objects to put on the road and see how full self driving does so if you don't know this test there is a a blocked left turn left turn where it can't see the left hand Direction until the last possible second the speed limit here is 45 but everybody knows 55 and there's a suicide Lane which you can see this car coming across here and so there's just a lot of traff got out out out oh this is a much more exciting test with you that went so well we're going to do it again how did you think would you thought anything if you thought I was driving the car or not I that was that was pretty perfect okay okay we're going to try it one more time just to just to make sure it wasn't a fluke but that actually went very very well and I'm telling you man I would never in a previous version of full self-driving have attempted to do this with with you in the car because it was it was scary as anything but that was pretty good it still feels like it needs to accelerate a little faster when it decides to go right it needs to be like you're gone but I think the issue with that one was no one was coming so it was like take your opportunity yeah yeah but it just it always feels to me like it could go a little bit faster out you know just like go when you're gonna go go I'll try to pay attention to that I can't promise anything okay cool and we can always go get our car washed I guess afterwards too so there you go let's just survive surv we're just going to do it twice today because the the real the real this is just the appetizer the real stuff is going to be testing with all of our little items that we purchased so yeah it'll be a lot of fun so definitely stick around for that but we're going to try this one more time because it's that was a lot of fun that was way more fun with you in the car than just me driving I wasn't it's it's a Sunday morning so it's uh you know or well not really yeah it's 11:09 Sunday morning he told me he was taking me to breakfast by the way just saying bait and switch bait and switch as soon as I said Dollar General she was like oh no I definitely did the bait and switch okay so uh I would love to try the U-turn here but it doesn't seem actually let's go ahead and try the U-turn I'm just going to pull in here and see if it can actually figure out how to do this yes we're just the people at Dollar General if they pay any attention must be like who is this random Tesla guy so let me see what the navigation shows because um I don't know let's try let's see what happens look every time in the past it's had bad navigation and it gets stuck here by the way if you haven't seen my navigation video definitely check it out it's up there right now but uh so yes that's the problem it decides you it can't go it can't go that way because there's nowhere to go and so it tries to get out there and so that's just a navigation issue it just doesn't understand it needs to make a U-turn there so anyway okay so let us go ahead and engage full self-driving yet again and we are going to do this um and it's going to go swimmingly well this time too and everything's going to be awesome so let's improve the view so we've got a barn assigned two trees cannot see crap that direction so the car's creeping forward as it should because it needs to get a little extra visibility so like I said everybody's going 55 here that guy's now going in the seide lane so he's out of the way though the car is creeping creeping creeping it's going a little go now go now no it definitely should not because there's a truck over there oh it doesn't get in the middle no it won't go in the suicide Lane it does not do illegal turns oh okay now we're in a little bit of a a little bit of Harm's Way here there's nobody coming from the left but it better go okay that worked out but I have a feeling if somebody was coming from the left it would have been a little scary so anyway it it was successful yeah I I'm I'm I'm scared but I'm impressed there we go okay so would you have if it if if you had thought that I was driving would you have really thought much about it or not y would I said why aren't you going I'm going to stop and Z through the part though car Qui the reason why I say that is because traffic there is because the red light lets or the the red that lets out so there's just so much traffic and then you get a small break a small window and it just so happened that those were happening at that time so you have to take your opportunity fast and and quite honestly this is a situation where Tesla's I know it's illegal to go in the suicide Lane if you're pulling out a left turn but once you're sort of committed to the turn like we were we we've gotten out far enough there that I was like you know if the car came from the left I would have preferred I probably would have disengaged and pulled yeah cuz I would not have felt comfortable as far out as we were into the into the traffic but so you know you got to hit a bailout situation where you do something that's technically illegal but very much safer than sitting with your nose out in traffic so it was successful but that was a little dicey there if somebody come from the left right at that moment that would have been bad um again another reason that the card should be able to back up under like really bad circumstances it should have been able oh it can't no it can't back up on full self- driving right now oh it's just like you better figure it out yeah it's like he's like buddy figure it out so it can't it can't reverse yet yeah then you would have had to like I would have had to hit it and go into the suicide Lane so anyway we are going to go to Costco and do some stuff and actually I'm going to feed her and then we're gonna do some test really why can't it it it can't it just I don't know why but but it should be able to well that would be great if isn't that what a human would do uh uh it's what a human would do yes absolutely but uh my club plan is expired okay we got to go we'll be back bye and we're back so many items from the dollar store will be potentially sacrificing their lives today so we have everything from a blowup unicorn to a pinata to some bubble wrap to a couple of bags to a big ball and a small ball and then this guy I don't even know ultimately whether it should stop or not for something that small so we will see but anyway that's what we're going to test it's going to be fun right all right so we have full self-driving enabled and I'm not unfortunately going to be able to use my phone to record me so we're only going to be getting the car here because I have to call misinformation we have to coordinate all this stuff so the recording quality is not going to be fantabulous either audio or video but we should get really interesting um you know information so anyway all right here we go all right so we got a free lawn mower thrown in so okay cool here we go test has commenced so let's see how it visualizes the guy in the lawn mower here so all right it sees him as a person so that's interesting and okay let's see I think it's visualizing something here don't know quite what that it doesn't know what it is yet but it's going to uh cool I think that was good okay okay all right we're coming around do another test so put it like yeah pretty close to where the black line is like out in the middle so it has to really think about it okay so it's visualizing something it sees it now What's it gonna do What's it gonna do What's it gonna do What's it gonna do okay uh that is that is got around it that's not how I would have done that woo it got its leg though did it did it actually hit the leg here we go all right car all right it sees it it sees it it sees it and yep okay so it's cleanly able to get around it it was not so happy when it was in the middle of the road though that's for sure okay full self-driving engaged that pinata is a lot smaller okay so it sees the oh no it definitely sees a blob there so it's it's visualizing it oh oh that's pretty good it's definitely seeing it as some sort of blob and it's definitely working and now it's trying to make a turn so cool here we go full self-driving engaged all right it does it notice me on the side of the yeah it sees you and it sees the pinata but what is it going to do oh this one's definitely stumping it I'm just going to sit here and wait and see what it's just stuck uh so it has no idea what to do it's like Tesla versus the pinata pinata one Tesla zero let me see if I nudge it hold on I'm gonna try to nudge it and just see if I force it to go and it has to make a decision no it is absolutely like I am not doing anything okay see it's scared to the pinata Tesla I want to take that picture hang on the Tesla is totally stuck with the pinata it's like I do not know what to do that's awesome all right maybe move it a little bit over to the right yeah like oh okay now it's going okay so it just it needed just a tiny fraction it was not happening it was going to move around me then yeah that's that was awesome okay let's try the other direction let's put the pinata that way in the other direction and see what happens next up commenced all right all right full self-driving what do we got okay it's visualizing it we have a we have a visual we have a visual and oh is it I think it's going to try to sneak around to the inside oo that worked that was okay cool so let's try the little the tiny object okay you want me to put it directly in the middle of the road or like would be no let's put a dead center in the middle so that it it sees it okay this will be interesting so honestly I don't know whether it's better for the car to just not pay attention to something this small or not so let me navigate to work so it has to go straight okay commencing commencing test all right so uh it sees the Amazon truck it does not see that little object yet it does not see it it does not see it it does not see it it does not see it's going to go St oh no did it sacrifice itself I wish I could record but I couldn't record it while I was on the phone it got crushed it was crushed oh you want me to a straight to it and like man down man down let's try it one more time from this Direction staying still next test commencing so anyway I'm not going to fault full self driving for this because this object is so small that it really should kind of ignore it so oh I think this time uh okay straight over it so that was better at least at least didn't crush it okay is there any way you can tie a string to it because that would be kickass okay moving tiny object test commencing here we go so wait until it gets pretty close and then start moving it so okay maybe about [Laughter] now oh was record that because it did not give a ready test commencing okay it doesn't even visualize it so I don't even think it's seeing it so okay like a fish on a hook Jiggle It Jiggle It Jiggle It Jiggle It Jiggle It Jiggle It Jiggle It oh it didn't care it okay so we we now have a lower bound on the object but it shouldn't but it should not swear for a squirrel No it shouldn't no I mean that's it's just it's just good to see that that is the lower bound like it's like nope I don't care about something that size okay so now bounce the ball yeah if you can try to roll it the first time and not bounce it but whatever just just get it in the way okay okay here we go commencing three two 1 go all right okay there you go roll it roll it oh did it hit it or did it just ignore it completely oh it ignored it completely yeah like it didn't like it was coming at all I like it should have Slamm on brakes for that it was a little bit late can you whoops can you try uh okay I'm going to try this direction why not um so do it just a little bit earlier because I think it was that was so late I was like gez all right even I would have had a very hard time reacting knowing but I feel like it should have slam on brakes because something like that comes out chances are something's chasing it or something but I don't all right you ready okay here we go three two 1 go and it sees you so go ahead go ahead go ahead oh it did turn on it did put on some sort of Hazard thing did it see it though it it it it went like that at the last possible second but that did not it did not stop okay so let's try like like roll it out a little bit earlier so that it has a little more of a chance okay before they get here three two 1 go okay when do you want me to do it a little bit earlier yeah do it now now oh oh it visualizes as dog okay so that was enough time okay you go ahead and go in front now all right here we go three two one go commencing all right car okay wow it's being very very cautious right now maybe it's starting to figure out that we're messing with it today tell me we now go oh it didn't there no it saw it but it actually it actually slowed down a little bit but then realized it was going to get around it so I think it was okay so let's try again it's definitely easier for it when it comes across the entire Road like that was easier for sure 3 2 1 go all right go oh it did it did it stop did it hit it or not yeah I mean it hit the ball but I mean it's slammed on brace so yeah well I just didn't know if it actually hit it so it hit it but like just a little bit Yeah the ball bounce that's good all right I mean it didn't go ricocheting off at some super high speed 3 two 1 go um okay there we go this thing is just like you are messing with me okay ready go oh dead did it actually run over did it visualize it yeah did it visualize it it didn't it didn't visualize it at all I was was like no okay so that was rolling right let's try is it still is it still alive or is it completely dead no it's still alive oh okay so it just it didn't actually run over it with a tire all right you ready three two 1 go y yeah like that okay ready yep go nope it's also spongy so it doesn't bounce just so no but the car it's clearly there there's like a lower limit because it's not seeing that ball at all it's just like nah I don't care yeah so so it's like anything smaller than like a chihuahua or something is just like nope okay off we go nobody's coming well there's a car coming no no no it's okay let it go let it go I want it to negotiate that okay so it saw you saw you walking it sees the other car this is actually good test if it's gonna see the bag okay so it sees the bag What's it gonna do okay oh wow okay that was pretty good all right that was actually well negotiated so it saw the bag it realized the woman was not and getting in our way all right that was good okay okay here we go off we go all right the big question is whether it's even it it is definitely seeing it it's visualizing it as something and okay so interesting so that that seems to be big enough okay so I'm going to come back the other way and on the other direction try it like putting it out in the spot that it seems to have problems with uh yep that looks like a pretty tough spot also that thing is highly that thing's highly visible okay here we go through two one go no I'm just saying because it's like gold it's gold foil and stuff it's like very very visible so uh uh oh uh oh uh oh it still avoided it though it definitely went around it avoided it now it saw it and it went around even though it fell over that was pretty cool so start we'll try it standing up first and then we'll try it laying down and see if that difference in position makes a difference okay okay uh hold on got it's annoying that this Imperial Road here is like it keeps wanting to turn on that road okay here we go commencing all right does it see it does it see it does it's breaking so it must see something yeah it's very minimally visible and okay definitely avoided it that way so let's try it the other direction but laying down so it's got a smaller like cross-section so I can't see it as well no do it facing me so it's the smallest possible like with the yeah like that cuz that really hard to see okay here we go all commencing in three two one it's visualizing you and the other pedestrian and the cars okay let's see if it even sees this thing I don't uh no okay so we have definitely determined that there is a minimum size it's like if it's that big I don't care about it and I'm going to ignore it so it's clearly got some sort of sized like resp restrictions on what it actually avoids really interesting okay all right so now let's try a few uh human experiments so what I want you to do is when I get close to you not when you're not when the car is like right up against you but like when it's a little ways in front pretend like you're going to jump out like Flinch towards the street so just stand next to it still and then uh and then Flinch like you're going to you know run out into the street or jump into the street yeah okay so it'll avoid this this okay so here we go three two one go I'm gonna get in trouble for this experiment no you're not this is fine yes I am people are going to like give me about it okay here we go it's not okay now wave it wave it like tell it to go there we go uh it was going before you did that okay so next time next time same experiment but what I want you to do is like hold up your hands like stop don't go and see if it see if it continues around or what as I'm walking yeah just sort of walk out walk out until it stops if it doesn't stop please don't continue to walk out well of course but but um but when it does so go over to the side with the straw on it so that you're closer okay I want it to see me more okay well it sees you right now it knows you're there so okay so what I want you to do this time is like when it gets close like wave your arms to stop it to tell it not to go any further so okay all right here we go commencing all right so walk across to get in front of it I'm watching okay now wave your hands just like yeah like that okay just keep waving keep waving don't stop don't stop don't stop but wait don't don't okay you want me to go back this way so it's still going even though you're telling it I don't know I meant like more violently like no no no don't go like just just be like push your hands like this like forward like don't go don't go all right here we go commencing like I'm I'm a little confused it sees you I just want you to like if there was a a horrible emergency go get in the road okay now now now tell it to stop like do this okay keep going keep just keep doing it keep doing it keep doing it keep doing it keep doing it but don't move no it's ignoring you it could care less whether you're saying go or not okay that's what I wanted to find out it was like nope I'm gonna go I don't care she's she's crazy okay I think that's good yeah all right so what did you think uh I feel like Size Matters that's what she said literally so yes it seemed like like the little stuffed animal and the little ball it was just like No And but it shouldn't matter about a small animal it shouldn't stop for a squirrel right so that's actually good I mean I think it was the experiment was just to see if there was a minimum size it cared about and clearly there is and the bubble wrap when the bubble wrap was sitting upright it saw it and it avoided it when it was down so it was a smaller cross-section avoided it I didn't avoid it it just kept driving I do like there was one of those times where I just acted like I was going to step out and it it immediately kind of moved over and hesitated and so I did like that because I wasn't going to go any further but it wasn't sure if I was so it it did what it should have done and I think that last experiment where you were just like stop stop stop and it eventually went I don't think it was certainly wasn't visualizing like your hands going like that so I think it I don't think body language yet people have said they think that it's reacting to body language but I don't think so because waving or doing whatever it doesn't seem to really care so yeah the ball one I thought was interesting because the ball was large enough right and I I guess in my mind I think if a ball runs out in the road the chances of a child is going to be coming after it is but I think it's looking it's not looking at what the object is it's looking at the size of it and how it's moving so it's not that advanced and and the big red ball when you put it out like right before before it got there it just was like well I mean there were good experiments cuz one of them it it it like did the hazard sign or like the sounds and stuff but it didn't actually like stop because it was so late and then the other time when you rolled it out right in front of it it actually did stop mostly I think it did touch it but it it stopped really well I think the most interesting one was the pinata and the placement because it it totally didn't know what to do that one time I was just like I'm not going to do anything pinata one Tesla yeah that was an interesting one and it was very specific to where it was in the road because it was like I well I felt like it was on this side there wasn't quite enough room for it to go on this side and it was like I don't know if I need to go all the way around and it was visualizing it if I recall correctly it was visualizing it as a dog so it was probably expecting it to move so it was probably waiting for the dog to like walk across the street or do something so you know that makes sense because the pinata kind of looks like a dog I guess it's supposed to be a donkey but whatever um but anyway so really fascinating stuff I mean this is huge improvements the fact that it's able to visualize small objects and generally speaking be very safe around them I mean I think that the ones with the small stuffed animal in the ball it was like those are so small that you just have to deal with it does not seem to be reading human body language yet like it knows it knew you were there but it was definitely not stopping for you it was not it was not reading your body language it was just like going around you as soon as it felt safe um but generally speaking really really good I I think very very significant progress I don't know I don't know what else impressed from yeah you know previous times we've done similar things to that it has it's failed pretty miserably before so it's a good combination because of course it can't stop at every possible thing on the road but it needs to be able to visualize anything that's large enough even if it doesn't know what it is and like the Unicorn it was just a blob it didn't visualize it as anything but it knew something was there and the bags it knew something was there so it avoided them so it was it was pretty good and the you know putting things out there that if you had run over it would have been fine for the car was kind of the idea so that's why we didn't use other right yeah we didn't want any actual children or adults you know to be harmed in the experiment so anyway let us know what you think uh hopefully uh other people will do some experiments like this and stuff certainly don't put yourself or your car in danger but you know we figured things like balloons and soft stuffed animals and stuff were were good and you know to the uh to the small stuffed animal that made a sacrifice you know yeah we your your sacrifice was worthy so all right we'll see you in the next video bye [Music] bye"
