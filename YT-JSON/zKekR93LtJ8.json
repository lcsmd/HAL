        "transcript": "look Trump's not a conservative he's an authoritarian narcissist so I think they basically called him out for that he's a populist authoritarian narcissist though historically speaking all of his Tendencies are you know basically where narcissism takes him which is whatever makes him popular or makes him feel good at any given moment and he and he doesn't think in in in classical liberal conservative terms he thinks in an authoritarian way and he's been able to get a a big chunk of the Republican base to follow him because you know he's the culture Warrior and that is former Republican El speaker Paul Ryan trashing Donald Trump Ryan who served as Speaker from 2015 to 2019 worked with Donald Trump before Trump became president Ryan nowers is on the board of Fox News parent company Fox Corporation so this attack on Trump is interesting on several levels Ryan spoke to T political risk co-president Kevin kajiwara kajuara asked Ryan about Republican Liz Cheney and Adam keninger whose political careers in the house came to an end after they stood against Trump I think Adam and Liz um stepped out of the the flow and called it out and um you know paid for it paid for it with their careers but I think again back to my earlier point I don't think you can be really very good at these jobs unless you're willing to lose these jobs and there has to be some line some principle that is so important to you that you're just not going to cross so that when you're brushing your teeth in the morning morning look at yourself in the mirror you like what you see um I think Adam and Liz are brushing their teeth liking what they see um and I think there a lot of people in Congress good friends of mine who would take the vote back if they could I take the vote back Ryan was referring to the second Trump impeachment related to Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election and blocked Joe Biden's presidential certification a week before the end of Trump's term the Democratic house at the time overwhelmingly voted for Trump's impeachment a majority of the Senate also went against Trump but enough Republicans stood with Trump that the Senate did not reach the two-thirds threshold to convict I think a lot of these members of Congress you know like on the second impeachment they thought Trump was dead they thought after January 6 he wasn't going to have it comeback he was dead so they figured I'm not going to take this heat I'm GNA vote against this impeachment because he's gone anyway but what's what's happened is he's been resurrected um there's lots of reasons for that but he has been so I think there's a lot of people who already regret not you know you know getting him out of the out of out of the way when when they could have you know like an impeachment um so I think history will be kind to those people who saw what was happening and called it out even though it was at the expense of their personal wellbeing and there are plenty of Republicans aside from Liz chany and Adam Ken Andrew who have paid a political price in the GOP for opposing Donald Trump Mitt Romney in the Senate who voted for Trump's impeachment recently announced he would not seek re-election Romney was going to face a magga primary opponent in Utah in the House Michigan Republican Fred Upton who has served in the house since the late 1980s V voted for Trump's impeachment saw the political wins afterwards and decided not to run for re-election in 2022 so Paul Ryan is spot on the Republican party has remained firmly in the grips of trump and the magga movement and nearly every Republican who has opposed Donald Trump has been hurt politically in the GOP the irony is that several Republicans loathe Donald Trump and will say as much off the Record and away from the microphones or cameras furthermore several Republicans who consider themselves to be moderate have privately expressed support for some Democratic legislative priorities but have then voted against the Democratic bills because they fear getting walloped by Mega conservatives it would be refreshing if more Republicans showed some courage and decency but as we've pointed out before most GOP lawmakers seem most interested in getting reelected and that is more important to them than standing for basic principles and integrity Paul Ryan put it a bit more diplomatically and delicately which underscores how he managed to climb the ranks and become Republican house speaker is a deaf political operator who has long managed to disagree with some colleagues without being disagreeable Ryan has been on the fox board of directors since 2019 this has rankled Donald Trump magga supporters and even some current and former Fox hosts including Tucker Carlson they have accused Paul Ryan of meddling behind the scenes to make Fox less supportive of Donald Trump Ryan's record on pushing Fox away from Trump hasn't gone as well as most of us would have liked but that's the legacy of Paul Ryan nice guy thoughtful man whose influence has always been mixed good for Ryan though and speaking out by the way diard magga house Republican Ralph Norman from South Carolina just got humiliated by a democrat in a house hearing I would wage you a good bit of money you get you give him with five doctors they would tell you the man's not there Democrat Mary scandin of Pennsylvania is there at this hearing and she's about to torch Norman have you spend any time with Mr Biden with the president good god did you go good God no no you You' been watching a little too much Fox News check out that video at the link below I'm David Shuster months before the 2024 election and the evidence is mounting that Donald Trump has gone Looney Tunes on his true social media platform Trump just posted a dozen unhinged video rants many of them have all cap captions and make claims that are patently false and absurd case in point Donald Trump a convicted Phil and has not been in prisoned yet however Trump thinks otherwise I am the political prisoner of a failing Nation but I will soon be free on November 5th the most important day in the history of our country and we will together make America great again again in President Biden's first three years the US economy created 15 million jobs in Donald Trump's first three years pre pandemic it was 6.8 million since Biden took office the stock market has risen by 35% and just set a new record high and the US violent crime rate has now dropped to its lowest level in 50 years but speaking of crimes on top of being convicted for falsifying business records in New York Donald Trump still faces other trials including for mishandling of classified documents and Trump keeps lying about how the FBI conducted The maralago Raid crooked Joe Biden's doj in their illegal and unconstitutional raid of maralago authorized the FBI to use deadly lethal force can you believe that now we know for sure that Joe Biden is a serious threat to democracy he is indeed a big threat not me actually the FBI marog was search warant had standard language that restricted every agent's use of force but Donald Trump and his minions have Twisted the boilerplate language to make crazy claims about an assassination attempt the Trump rhetoric is outrageous and over the toop and it could spark Mega violence against federal agents so the courts and Trump's remaining legal cases are now considering new gag orders on Trump that's right the courts have already found Trump to be a threat and may declare him an even bigger threat and all Donald Trump can do is keep projecting and spewing nonsense and speaking of nonsense in another true social video Donald Trump declared that he alone has the power to get Wall Street Journal reporter Evan gershkovich released from a Russian jail Trump added it will happen if he Trump wins the November election Evan gershkovich the reporter from The Wall Street Journal who is being held held by Russia will be released almost immediately after the election but definitely before I assume office he will be home he'll be safe Vladimir Putin President of Russia will do that for me and I don't believe he'll do it for anyone else and we will be paying nothing Biden likes to pay massive numbers we will be paying nothing Trump first made this claim a few weeks ago at the time Kremlin spokesman Demitri pesov said the Russian government has not had any contacts with Donald Trump pcof added regarding us-russian contexts in the matter of incarcerated and convicted individuals we can say these contexts must be carried out in total secrecy this is the only way they can be effective in other words even if Trump has a special connection with Russia Trump is not following Russia's instructions on how to try and obtain the reporter's release however this gets even worse because Donald Trump's video is incentivizing Russia's Vladimir Putin to keep gershkovich prisoner also think of how ridiculous Donald Trump's claim is in terms of us politics if Trump really had the power to get the reporter released wouldn't it make more sense for Trump to get the release before the election that way Trump would get credit before voters head to the polls but Donald Trump cannot get the reporter released Trump is selling snake oil about the election to us voters and the family and friends of the imprisoned reporter have to suffer even more Donald Trump is sick even by Trump's standards and whether Trump is ranting in his truth social videos or spewing out all Cap's screeds the rhetoric keeps getting more insane and untethered from reality and as the summer goes along and the legal and political pressure on Trump keep building watch out Trump's nonsense is going to get worse by the way one of Donald Trump's fiercest supporters in Congress margorie Taylor green just got scolded to her face by Republicans at the house oversight committee Republican margerie Taylor green tried to suspend reality I don't need your answer I want to talk about this right here mrcla I reclaim my time I reclaim my time Mr check out that video at the link below I'm David Shuster thanks for joining us"
