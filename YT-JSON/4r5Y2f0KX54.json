        "transcript": "here we are with another autogen update with 0.211 I'll briefly go over some of the smaller updates and then I'll get into the code and explanation of autogen Studio UI update and something called multiple chats like I said simple updates first so we have allow timeout for code execution in Windows there's an overall Improvement in documentation including the function calls where they use decorators and they've updated previous versions to show that they removed useless code in group chat which is basically saying they've had code cleanup they simplified the handling of the termination message and finally they have a notebook section in their website now which this is the code from the notebooks folder or directory in their GitHub page where you can find other simple projects they started to Port it over to their website so it's easier to see now we can move on to a bigger one with autogen Studio UI the first thing we need to do is upgrade it so you can type pip install either just type in autogen studio if this is the first time that you're installing it or you'll say D- upgrade autogen Studio after that's done in the terminal type in aut gen Studio space UI space- dport then give it 8080 or whichever Port you want and then we'll open up the URL from the terminal and the first update that I want to show you is now you see these workflows when you go to the build section and then you go to workflows you can actually download these into a Json file this is an example one whenever you load it up there's now a download button here so let's download it right this is going to download as a Json file as you can see travel agent group chatwork flow. Json and this is going to be all of the properties from this workfl what we can do now is take that Json file as you see here I just put it into a new project I created I now have imported Auto gen Studio the workflow config and the workflow manager we can open up this Json file okay we can take this Json file add it into a workflow configuration object and then basically say agent workflow. run some some message that we would say in the UI so whenever I start the workflow in the UI and I type in what places would you go to visit in Paris and I press enter to initiate the chat that's the same thing as putting the task here and starting the agent workflow. run function now they also have a full-fledged code editor within the skills or wherever you create the functions so if you go to the build section then go to the skills tab let's click on the generate images which is one they already have an example of you can see they have a full code editor here which is a lot nicer to work with they now have a way to test your models connection what does that mean well if you go to the models tab in the build let's click on the gp4 preview now let's me just put in some random API key here right this is definitely incorrect now there's a test model button if I click that it's going to say there's an invalid API key now if I put in a valid key so let me just copy this in and then hit test model this is going to say the model tested successfully with the parameter or the property open AI API key I gave it a valid one this is just a nice way to make sure that the model your testing is going to work and finally they added a speaker workflow drop down down uh in the group chat so if you go over to the workflows let's click on the travel agent again now if we go to group chat manager then you can see there's a speaker selection method there's Auto round robin and random okay I think it before it was just like Auto and last or something but now they added round robin and random like we can do in our terminal IDE these were some nice updates to autogen Studio UI however what I noticed was even whenever I put the API keys in the models for the workflow it still does it still says that have a missing API key so you still have to export the open AI API key in your terminal whenever you're running autogen Studio UI but other than that they're really starting to upgrade this thing and add in all the features that you can do through code which is nice I like that now there is a new way to interact with the agents called multi-agent chats the way we almost always initiated chat was we would say user proxy do initiate chat and then whoever we wanted to initiate the chat with whether it's a group chat or just one agent called an assistant and then you would give it the message of what you'd want to do and now there's an initiate chats let's go over the code so I have two arrays here one called Financial task and another called writing task the financial task is an array there are two messages here this one and then the second one we investigate possible reasons of the stock performance so what we want to do is find the current stock prices of Nvidia and Tesla and their performance over the past month in terms of percentage and then investigate possible reasons of their performance whatever is and then I have a writing task it's just one in this array to develop a Blog based on the information that was provided okay that's all it says right now that might not make much sense but let's keep going there are three assistant agents A a financial assistant a research assistant and then a writer okay nothing crazy here these this is normal and then we have a user agent with a code execution we have a working directory for task use Docker false um and then we come down to the initiate chats so what's happening here well we say initiate chats and this is an array right and then each array is an object of properties basically so the first recipient is going to be the financial assistant okay the message is going to be from the financial task array up top it's going to be the first message so up here the first message was what are the current stock prices of Nvidia and Tesla okay that's the first message we have that new clear history that I talked about last week's update to True silent is a new property this just means that it's not going to uh show output so if this was true it wouldn't show the output but it's false by default it's false it's just here to show you that it exists so it's we're going to see the output and then now for the probably the more important new property with this is called the summary method and there's two choices the first one is the reflection with llm which causes the llm call to reflect back on chat history and then summarize the takeaway and then give that as a response and then there's also last message which is just going to take the last message from from the chat and then give that as a response and there's a new property here called carry over and what it's saying is I want to include a figure or table of data in the blog post okay so what this carryover property is saying is all of the previous here the previous two the previous two response messages carry them over here and then include them as part of my response whenever I'm done with this LM call to the writer and it's used as additional context for for um for this call one thing I've noticed is each each of these calls it's not like these are considered one API call these are three separate API calls so each of these are going to cost their own number of cents now that I ran it we can see the first one it says start a new chat with the following message the this is the First Financial task uh item in the array where it ask what are the current stock prices of Nvidia and Tesla says with the following car with the following carry over there is no carryover we didn't spend specify it and there wouldn't be any ways with the first um with the first uh call so then it's saying user to the financial assistant what are the current stock prices um it executes it the user then executes executes it and gets an output okay then it says terminate okay so now we're done with that first call now we move on to the second one so this is this was the second Financial task um item in that array so it investigate possible reasons of the stock performance and it has the following carryover the current stock price of Nvidia is the same price that we had up here 6964 and it's showing a 31% increase over the past month okay so it's it's automatically carrying over the me the response from the previous now we're to the last chat message right of the initiate chats develop an engaging blog post using any information provided this was the third one okay and it has with the following carryover now it also added I want to include a figure or or table of data in the blog post so it automatically carries over the responses from the previous chats in addition to anything you have in that carryover property as we can see here right so the carryover was this but it also added the responses from the previous two llm calls now what I'll say about this is I have mixed feelings about this to be honest with you because if you're using open AI API you're going to use more money doing it this way the more agents you have the more calls you want to make you know each uh each chat even though it looks like it might be bundled into one it's really not you're still making separate calls okay now what I think this is great though this is great for local open source uh llms like if you're using like something like LM Studio or AMA or something like that this is great because it seems like you can make it more structured the way you talk to the agents and you can talk to specific agents with specific messages and you can also give more context for the next agent okay so the last thing I'm going to go over and I'm going to go over this briefly is because I think this takes its own video like this is a lot right this is definitely should be its own video to go over but it's it's called a graph modeling language using select speaker okay and right now there's only a couple ways to have different select speaker methods including like something like round robin but I'm just going to go over kind of like the images here to give you a breakdown uh right now like say we have five agents here 0 1 2 3 and four okay in this graph every agent can talk to anybody right and whenever you normally run it you don't always get the same results like you don't they're just in the group chat and they're not always going to talk to each other in a specific order sometimes you can get if you use different seeds you can get different orders it seems kind of random right I think that's the auto the auto selection is by default um but and you know that could be good it's not saying it's a bad thing but there are some other possibilities here what if we wanted everybody only talk to One agent right so Agent Zero maybe this is me the user then we have four other other agents here and what if we only want them to just speak back to me and then I give something back to them right we don't want them speaking with each other well that's possible with this okay and then also here we have a example of we have like team captains right so AO is like uh Captain the captain for team a b 0 is the captain for Team B and c0 is the captain for team C well what if we had different teams perform different functions specifically and like all of a team um maybe they were just reading idea so they could all talk to each other and then give that back to the captain and then the captain would send that over to the next team and maybe they were they actually did the writing right so then all the agents within the B team they could talk to each other right and they could confer with each other and make it better they can make up a summary or blog post or whatever it is then they send that to the captain now the captain sends that to the last team team C and maybe they're um I don't know maybe they're getting ready to publish it right so they like they're the publishers well everybody within teamc can talk to each other here and then send that back once they're done back to the captain then then we can do something with it right so this is another way that we can organize the chat ourselves with a graph like I said this is more this is more advanced and requires its own video but I just wanted to show you this uh just so that you can understand it exists and you can look at it if you want to okay thanks for watching that was another autogen update there will probably be another one next week and I'll cover that one too it seems like with autogen Studio UI they're constantly every week uh getting updates and adding them from like whenever you uh install it through python getting all the functionality there importing it to the UI which is nice especially for somebody you know some people don't really want a code or maybe aren't worried about it don't know it yet and they just kind of want to get their feet wet well this is great AUD Studio UI is a great way to just kind of get started and all you have to worry about is your API key and that's it check out my GitHub page I put new code up every week especially what I'm doing here it's all free to use and I also have a newsletter that send out every Sunday at noon sign up if you want you're not forced to but if you would like to it kind of give you Insight on what I'm doing any troubles that I had what I plan on in the future and so forth if you have any comments please leave them down in the section below and like And subscribe and I will see you next video"
