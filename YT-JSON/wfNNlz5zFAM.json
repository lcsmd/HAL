        "transcript": "okay so llama 3 was released a few days ago what was the first thing you've built first thing I buil with llama was to integrate it with this um framework that I created like an agentic framework called my asro and actually fun fact anthropic just emailed me last night say that I won the act like basically they have this like competition was like a developer competition and so like basically my EST is like this framework that allows you to you just specify a goal and then there's like a more intelligent AI in the case of my was oppos Cloud 3 that directs basically this like mini agent of like less intelligent AI IU to achieve a goal and so it's very interesting to see how you know this system thinks and so the first thing that built with Lama was like would wouldn't be cool if I take this framework and I adapt it locally and so now I basically have you know like the way I describe it it's like you feel you have the power of the Gods in your hands right because you have this thing where you say hey know make me an app about you know whatever you want one and he just goes and thinks through all the mini agents and he splits up you know a folder with like your files it's it's it's super cool the reason you use hu I assume is for cause reasons right there's actually a bunch of reasons so one it's like I really like the style of IU like when those we F and how fast it is uh you know generating those answer right and so my my idea was like well this is a a a model that is of the level of gbd4 I would say almost because I put it more between 3.5 and four which cost uh 25 cents per million token which is crazy crazy how Che it is right and and so my idea was like you know that the that model is still good enough to execute the task as long the smartest model it's like checking it on basically and so that's how I solved this issue because I like it doesn't it didn't matter if the task solver wasn't that smart as long as the very end you have sort of like you know the big brain going be like okay no actually this is needs to be fixed right and so it's very interesting but that was the main reason was like speed cost and I just like the style of of IA so basically like a senior developer checking the work of a junior one at the end of the project yes in fact it's funny to say that because the original name it was uh it was Ser developer and but I was like that I don't know it's funny enough and and Myra just like seems better also because the the function I call it orchestrator initially um but yeah that's that's that was the concept yeah and you also incorpor with amaama right by the way if you want me to make a personalized AI strategy just for you then you have last 5 days to join the community because this is an April only offer of course you get access to all the smartest people at The Cutting Edge of AI as well as plenty of AI trainings courses workshops and more as well as two weekly calls when you can talk to me directly and ask any question you want by the way the price is going up soon because in May I will be implementing some custom software just for the community members but yeah yeah if you want to join then make sure to join now because the price is going up soon yes and that's where Lama 3 came in uh because you know I was like you know we'll be very fun to run this locally and it it it does work uh and it's pretty impressive to see how like you know the the reasoning of of Lama 3 it's like really good to see like going task by task so would you say llama 370b is on like the same level as gbt 4 I would you say it's still like not quite there I would say for things like function calling and you know J mode probably not yet but I'm sure you know they're going to probably release some sort of fine tune that or somebody else is going to do it that like kind know now's research like those guys are awesome right they're probably going to do a fine tune but I would say like you know for like every every other task I would say it's pretty it's pretty close like even just like regular coding that doesn't require you know like um a lot of you know different like formatting like I I think it's it's amazing I tested it uh you able to get you know functional like code that first try which never happened Lama um and uh yeah I would say I would say meta did something really really magical with this one and to me like it's it's less that you know it's 70 billion it can compete with gbd4 but it's more about like we have a local model now that can compete with GT4 you know like I put on my M3 and I just like chat with it like that's just crazy if you think about it right I mean that's that's exactly why I bought an M3 because I saw like the potential of open models and I just wanted a machine that can handle it all right so like it's crazy because the 8 billion model of llama 3 is actually comparative with the 70 billion model of Lama 2 like that's insane yes yeah and 3.5 right like it actually Compares pretty well with and and when you think about it you know like I would say you know we're so into this world right we're so into the AI space but when you go out and you go out of this you know did zoom out 99% of people that ever interact with tool they're still on the free version of chbt that's crazy and so it's interesting to think that we are experiencing the power of something that gb4 level on our computer when people like the main interaction with AI is still like the free version of chbt right um and I think about this a lot actually and like how can I you know build the future that I want based on that basically dude I think so many people were like get like a bad impression of the AI field just because of this like they Tred the free version of chbt and like H it's it's you know cool and all but like it's not really that impressive like there is so much more like come on man yeah I mean even the free version of of of cloud is better than the free version of definitely like if you get Sonet you get Sonet for free I think yeah yeah uh yeah and that's like you know Sonet is amazing too it's I don't I don't use it much because it it I I never like the mill model like like when when you know when Lama came and he had like the 7B the 14 billion and like no it was like the 31 billion and yeah I was I was like why would I use this you know it's just a weird case and I'm actually I'm glad that they clean up this release and it just did like a smaller model and a bigger model because that's like the two cases you need you don't need like something in the middle right yeah I also never used Sonet even though like it's it's like really good at basically all the benchmarks and the pricing is super competitive like much cheaper than Opus like it's it's such a weird spot right the middle model it's like yeah exactly yeah okay have you have you experien it with like you play a lot with like cloud and yeah llama actually one thing that I resonated with is that you mentioned that Hau is like really creative and this is perhaps my biggest experience with CLA 3 is that on like you know tasks where creativity or like it's obviously not like fully creative but like pseudo creative on those tasks when it's like brain brainstorming ideas and stuff like that I feel like CLA 3 completely destroys gbd4 I don't know to explain it I don't know what the difference I agree with you I couldn't not I actually have a really good example of this so you know like I have this company it's called everr right and so one of the vision with everr is creating you know what we call ACI which is artificial creative intelligence right like how do we bring all the power of creativity into AI tools basically right and I so what you saw with my asro is just a subset of the experiment I'm running right and so I build this uh AI assistant basically like a myestro concept but actually it looks at images and it gives you basically you know like a description of a group of images and then he provides you like an analysis that you can use and I cannot explain to you how good is I could combine with OPP so cloud cloud 3 in general a creative task like like if you take like if you ask she like if if you go right now on chbt and ask gb4 Vision even the last version hey here's like five images right create you know something that's similar or like a prompt that it's similar it just goes off the rail it's just not able it will give you like you know oh a night impair is like all this [ __ ] but Cloud three is TR it's truly creative like it understands you know and and and and and I and I wish you know like people talk more about this stuff in Benchmark because it's always like like you know intelligence and coding and math but this thing is so creative and I'm glad you brought it up because I you know this is a topic that I think about a lot so why do you think that is like is the training data different is the rhf different I think is definitely the the reinforcement learning is different I think uh open AI probably you know they and this is just my you know don't take this for granted just the way I think but I think open AI it's probably lobotomized their Model A lot when it comes to creativity because when we see creativity as human we attribute a Consciousness yeah right yeah like that's why like Cloud just feel feels alive right more than GB G4 is just like it's great but it's just so boring right and I think like they did that on purpose so that this is a tool it's an AI tool and doesn't scare anybody but but it's also being interesting to see anthropic like you know like I was never an anthropic fan like when when Cloud 2 was around like never use it I thought it was awful and it's I mean even The Benchmark proves it right and and they were always the guys they were saying like oh yeah is scary we're doing all those things and the I and then with Cloud 3 they just went you know the opposite direction they were showing us that the model was creative during training and there was aware that you remember that post that the the the prompt engineer did that was like oh when we were training he knew we were training and I was like wait what like how did you guys you know go so 180 and uh and I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that they're trying to make this model feel more alive and if he feels more alive he's also more creative I think okay but obviously it's not self-aware like you know it's still llm but I think a lot of people like especially beginners like get this impression of like you know it's it's more conscience and then it's like creates that sort of a I don't know how to describe it almost like a hype right where people are like oh my God we're so close to creating Consciousness while like it's just a better tuned llm basically yeah I mean it's so funny to say that I mean if you listen to any interview of like CLA mod the CEO of inter and Tropic like every time he speaks we makes you believe it he has a GI achieved right like he he just did this interview um I forgot it was like some Forum it was like a yesterday or two days ago and he's talking about synthetic data and basically what he's saying is like we can apply the same concept of like alao to synthetic data to create this like endlessly simulator of really good data because the model only needs is just good data just got to could create it right and so and I'm like okay you know like what house do do you guys have this house it's like uh it's it's it's it's very interesting how um you know like the perception and and I and I agree with you like I think it's a tool that they use as a marketing tool right because it gets people to talk more and and we are talking about it right so and and when Cloud 3 dropped all you heard was about like how real he felt and how conscious as he was it was less about how good he was and like all this kind of stuff so I mean to give a bit cretive to Google I would say j is also pretty creative definitely more than gbd4 so like I don't know opening I really like did something there where it just like made it super cuz like when I tried to get like title variations for YouTube videos I go to CLA 3 and I I never go to gbd4 never and so I did some um I I helped this company out for for a while for like consultancy and they had this this problem with YouTube videos titles in particular and uh the the gbd4 no matter what you say no no matter what you will like the way you you do the prom no matter the function colon you use it will always use semicolon in the title oh yes it will always put like a like a semicolon yeah best things to doons yeah it's like quean to do columns here's 10 and and and it's just so annoying and and instead like Cloud 3 and even llama 3 actually you should try I try Lama 3 with YouTube videos it's incredible because Lama 3 I think actually one thing that people haven't spoke about it does really work is retrieval on text that you provide so like if you if you give L 3 like 10 YouTube titles and you just ask like aut complete it does a really good job and Cloud 3 does a really good job too but gbd4 it was just you know put the the colums and like I I hit it like it's just like yeah yeah I think like five months ago I spent quite a bit of time just creating like a set of titles and then using like vector embeddings to feed it into gbd4 and I never got it to really work so I was like you know is it just me like is it a skill issue but now like we see like CLA three it's like maybe it was a modal issue yeah it's definitely Mo ofation you know why because like I another really fun experiment I did when Cloud 3 dropped was I so I um basically I took all my tweets so I made this like script on JavaScript that collect all the tweets I ever done which is like around 800 so it's not a lot of them but it's enough to fine tune a model basically and I was like and I and I have a lot of experience like fine tune LMS and I was like I want to see how good of a one shot fine tuning Cloud can be and so I gave it the data structur in a Json file it was like you know this is Petro twe and this is the Tweet right assistant this is a twe answer this is like the actual tweet and I was like okay basically I say to Cloud I want you to find T yourself on this data and you know you you have to create Tweets in this style and I cannot explain to you my mind was blond I say okay make a style make a a tweet in a style of petro and it just speaks like me I I will send you the Tweet after it's like it literally speaks of me it uses the same way that I speak it like he he tagged ever R in some tweet it tagged rep because I use rep a lot to like you know share some of my open source programs and and stuff and I I was just mind blowing and I it got me thinking like wow like if a model is good enough like retrieval or just like you know how a completion you basically get one shot fine tuning and I I think like that's going to be like you know the road that we're going to go and the model is just going to be better at that so speaking about fine tuning when do you think people or companies should fine tune instead of just you know providing external knowledge that's a great that's a great uh well it's so there there's two cases in my opinion it's like one where your data just not available right and that's the sort of like the the core of the issue that where should we solve by everr right ever artist F tuning for images but you know you can apply the concept on anything right like like Brands and corporations like artist C platform because their data is not part of foundational model but you know they have a very specific style they have a very specific brand they I don't know they have like a it can it looks in a certain way and uh you know they can train a model on their data change enough of the model with when it's copyright free basically and then use you know to generate like assets so that's like a case right the other ISE is more personal I feel like personal to to the to the to actual life like I can see a case where um you know we're going to have a little device that knows a lot about us and is going to be you know like fine tune on your on your own preference like the way you speak and like the things that you do and it's GNA like help you out um during the day and then there's also cases where you know like even if the model knows a lot about a certain topic like this is more applying on MLM fine tuning on something might be very like you know it might it might be very good for your comp for example I can think about uh you know like if you are um a company that I don't know making this up let's say you sell snacks right and you want your customer support to feel like in in the tone and sort of like in the the way you speak and the way you approach your customer then that's a perfect case when you should find TM on your tone and your style so then that llm basically becomes an extension of yourself an extension of your brand right um and so I think you know it's it varies it's like when you don't have enough data when your data is not present or when you just want to like argument your experience basically do you think that in the future when AI is Advanced enough uh fine tuning will be like the way to ensure that you know the AI is aligned with your personal interest instead of the company who trained it yes I I believe so yeah and and of course like a lot of that future depends you know how willing to fine-tune the company is you know we're see like you know uh open AI for the longest time they will only get to fine tune you know 3.5 and if you f tune four it's millions of dollar right um but and so I I I I believe that's the future I really believe fine tuning and it wouldn't be I would say the fine tune that we have today where it's like you know it takes like six hours to create like a I mean for a small fine tun six hour but it take you know like like a day if you want to get like a really good fine tun it would be something that closer to what we were talking about where the models are so smart they can basically rearrange weights in real in real time to accustom your needs and and I really believe that's going to be the future of of AI more personalized Ai and how far away do you think we are um I would say like like for a future where everybody has a something in their house that knows them probably a little more like probably like a little more than five years I would say but to a point where fine tuning are good enough to do that like or models are good enough to like instant F tun I would say like yeah probably like you know know three three to five years I think we're we're because even I I see you know like I basically like uh so we have this like stats in my in my app where we can see how many model you find tune right so I find tune since uh October last year I F tune 1250 models on image mod so I feel like now I got I really got a sense of like the tech and like where the tech is going and I I'm always sort of like trying to be on the edge of it and uh it just getting really it's just getting better and better and I think like yeah we're going to get to a point where uh this thing is going to be easier yeah yeah I agree you mentioned um you know five years for for that so you aren't in the AGI in six months category sounds like no no I don't think so and I'm not and I'm actually a very optimistic person uh but you know why I don't think it's in the six months it's less about what we're capable of it's it's just more about Corporation exactly yeah about Corporation not want it to to push it because you know like if this qar thing is real from open AI you know we probably accelerate the timeline a lot and and and they're just like you know maybe they're just like a little worry um but I I'm definitely like optimistic when it comes to to AGI so if you had to say like is it five 10 years 15 years I would say it's definitely in the in the F in the in the five years range yeah I wouldn't put it I would be very surprised if it's more than five years consider like how fast this thing are moving like going back to the Llama example right we have a model that it's like you know like so much smaller that performs at the at the highest level model of like just a year ago right and so like you can imagine how even like uh micros just relas like a very small model that does really well to it's just like like the P3 uh like a three billion parameter model that that does as well as the Llama so it's like you know it's it's I think we're just going so fast but it it will really depend on how willing those companies are to release the stack and honestly like that's kind of like the annoying thing for me too where it's like I think this is the very first time okay I let me let me rephrase this way excluding military Tech right because military Tech is always been like Advan and it's always been like years ahead and there's reason why you can ask this military Tech right yeah um this is the first time in technology I feel like where we are so we could potentially be so ahead of our time but we're really bottleneck by regulation and fear and and you know some of those things are justify I think uh but it's it's interesting to leave in this timeline basically and why do you think that is because you know open AI for example was founded to prevent this to make it make sure that everything is accessible to everyone yeah that and also I think open is interesting case because they're the first one that you know became famous for it right and I feel like even what we were saying before you know why open ey lobotomize their model so much I think there is a pressure in being the first one and you know you're trying to do the things right and even at the cost of you know degrading the quality where if you are you know a newcomer I wouldn't say I wouldn't call anthropic a newcomer those guys have been doing you know like that for 20 years more so as like if you want to be the the new open AI you got to be aggressive you have to have a model that feels like real you have to you know um and and but I think you know open AI was always created with the idea of creating you know safe AGI and so I I respect them for like you know keep that mindset and not going like oh we're going to release you know gbt gbt F today and like you we're going to we're going to change the word and all this stuff so um yeah but like wouldn't the middle ground be for them to open source gpt3 I mean it's like the last thing they open source gbt2 now yeah but I I I think like they will probably in like like especially now that Andre Kari is gone I will be I would never think that they will going open source any of their model um because they I think rly so they believe their model are very powerful right like when you think about like there are people that still miss DaVinci DaVinci too uh because it was like so good at like creativity and uh how of completion and like you know embedding and like all this kind of stuff and so like I think there's so much power on topped in this older model that we haven't really experienced because they were never given you know as open source model and I feel like you know the there's just like a fear that somebody could do something wrong with it and and you know I think that's Justified um and I I would be very surprised if there release anything open source yeah I mean there is always this argument that the people who really want to commit something terrible can just use Google and find it right so which I which I agree but at the same time it's like like I if I put myself in their shoes right and it's like do I want my name to be associate with that you know if Lama 3 I'm not saying this is going to happen right but if Lama 3 tomorrow gets fine tune to create malware and you know like an agenty Behavior to get into somebody computer I mean you could do that today you could find tune Lama to do that right and like do I want that like image on me right probably not if I if I'm up AI but uh I think it's just about like the level of risk that you want to take as a as a company yeah I think this is you brought a great point where always it takes almost a new company to like break through the next Paradigm because Google like in theory Google should have not allowed open AI to even exist because they made the Transformer and they could have released something as powerful as gbt 3.5 probably in like 2018 so like you know but they had so much reputation as you said like it's always the cost of being like something bad happening and having your entire brand associated with it so yeah I mean it almost takes like a new you know a new company a new startup to experiment with the new stuff I agree I agree and and it's funny because you know I worked at Facebook uh for like around three years so I have experienced you know the big corporate Tech America and like like everything that happened to Google makes sense to me because uh you know when you have a company that runs on okrs and timeline and goals and and your team goal and like your performance review and like it becomes you know it's less about the greater good it's less about you know what are we actually putting out it's more about like how can I you know get a get a bonus how can I get you know and and and you know you don't get a bonus for changing the word sometimes you get a bonus if you just like you know shut up and and do what your manager wants which is very sad and and I think you know that's what happened to to Google they had this incredible technology as you say like since like 2017 I think that's what the attention or you need um came out and they never did anything with it and but I'm seeing like a little wave change now I think like I think now they waking up a little bit and like I'm seeing like a lot of new research you know Reon from Google that's very interesting um and I think you know maybe now they learn their lesson like they're not gonna like you know let those uh brilliant mind go and and build like you know 10 different companies and um it's uh but as you were saying before too I feel like jimy and I especially 1.5 Pro it's really good um especially when it comes to like long Contents I think they're they're slowly catching up uh they're definitely not the level of you know cloud or or even mistol which is which is crazy like you think about a French company like destroying them uh but yeah I mean Google I think has the potential to be the best if they just decided to like they probably have the most data out of anybody and like they could build with that the best models and they have tons of compute obviously their own tpus so it just takes somebody to kind of shake things up maybe a new CEO I don't know but yeah I think Google like has major potential and people should not count them out actually I think like the the true sleeper giant it's Apple because they're they're the guys that you know like like thinking about iOS like how long did it took to have folders in iOS like I mean like five six years you know just to have the ability to put your fold like they're the people that like they will take their sweet sweet time but when they come out and and actually thinking about data I think they're going to win this like like imagine all the iMessage data like all all the in device but will they use that it's like apple is known for like privacy you know well so I was thinking about this other day and I was like okay all the data is encrypted end to end right uh but they do have the way to encrypt the keys yeah I I I mean I don't I don't know I I feel like I I feel like if they want to do it they could do it oh yeah definitely I mean if like if the CIA put pressure on them they would get some data so yeah exactly so and I mean I don't I I don't know maybe maybe they found a way where in pure apple style they be like like we're you know we are changing this model but we don't see it it's it's the model is se you know it's like you know nobody's seeing this data it's just it goes into the model at Zer ones uh but you know the model is I don't know but but I also believe like they've been doing so many investment the past you know 10 years the B all this AI company they of course they make their own their own GPU and CPU now like they all combine the ml chip which it's amazing by the way I use it you know fine tune models and stuff like that and um and so I think like there just from Hardo perspective and user based perspective they're the one that're like if they launch something that it's like a local llm or a city powered by some sort of LM I think they're going to be like in a really good spot yeah I mean I think uh you brought up the Investments right I think they're actually acquire the most AI startups out of anybody yeah I think so too yeah I I I remember reading it this uh chart it was like all the company they bought in the past five years it's crazy um so I I I definitely think they're in a sweet spot and uh and Google too but but but then also you now you know meta has all the gpus now so it's like it's a very interesting landscape like I think they have 35,000 like h00 oh 350 Jesus um yeah it's it's wild yeah and it's actually funny because they only use 10% to train the model and 90% to run it so it's like and I think is for like reals too like to run reals and like all this stuff there that was the original right Zak uh didn't even like predict the AI he just wanted basically better recommendation algorithms and just happened to like align with the wave so funny yeah he's he's always the one thing about Mark Zach is like people dabed him a lot but like at the end of the day the dude has been having one Mission since he was like 15 years old like if you if you have there's like this website that you can still look you can still look it up the first webs that M Zak ever created and uh it's on the web time machine and um there's a page called the web and he's talking about how the web is going to be more connect like this dude has been thinking about the same thing since he was like 15 so like I love to bat on people that I've always have a fir belief on something like even when I look back at my life right and because it's hard when you see yourself like like you know like I I watch a bunch of your video it's actually funny because after you shout to me I was like wait wait a second like I watch a lot of you know assistant I watch like some of your more technical video I was like and I following and loving your content for a while and I was like when I look at somebody like you I'm like you know this is a guy that is just like passionate about this and it's been Amor this for a long time and the only path to that is Success right and so but when you look at yourself it's like really hard to tell that and I was thinking about this and you know now I run this like you know AI art brand design company if you want to call it and you know I was talking to my mom and we were like talking about some some stuff and she brought up you know those drawings that I used to do since I was like you know five years old and I was like you know what it's is so interesting like whatever this thing is it's been with me for so long that there is no other way for me to not do this and I get I always B on those kinds of people and I think like you know like Mar Zak was just like one of those you can you can't just B against it but so many people do it's it's crazy because like when when the rebranding to meta happened and then you know that stock stock dipped massively like so many people are counting him I was like oh my God it's over and like he pulled out the craziest comeback ever yeah and that's why he's been changing his Brands a lot right like like now he's like all the memes it's like you know he's attractive now he has swag right and I think like that like that helps like when people see you at this like scary alien like they used to see him before of course you're gonna get that sort of critique like but now he's like he's cool Zach now right it's just it's very funny how how people think yeah doing like MMA and stuff and like he's doing side quest he like he like smokes Meats he has like he has like Kobe beef in a why it's so funny yeah but like he what he did really well is that he retained enough control of the company where he actually can make decision right because so many of these companies where they get to a sufficient size it's just all dries down to the management and the co has less and less control that way when like there is something big that needs to happen some big shift like Rebrand ending to meta like so many companies just wouldn't be able to do that purely from the bureaucratic friction oh for sure and and like another thing too about him it's like you know once again I worked there I used to do like what was called the Zach review which is like you go and you you show the product that you're working on this guy knew everything about Facebook what I'm talking about you know he will know this butn that I never even see it because it wasn't my team I'm I'm not joking like he would be like hey there's like a bon in this's you know 20 Pages down on this page that I don't like he's TR like the the the the thing about him is meta is Facebook and and I think like you know only if you have that level of control and that sort of like understanding of your product then you know you can you can make the sort of decision you know and uh it's just very interesting yeah I I've seen this tweet I don't know who posted it but it was basically like Mark Zuckerberg is doing what samman was supposed to do but like everybody's hating on Zak because of his reputation is kind of negative and everybody's praising Sam as this Visionary right yeah and and I know and I mean the interesting thing about s too it's like if you it was just like an interview that that just got released it's him and the the co yeah um and um he's talking about like like he was still a y Comin wasn't even interested in open Ai and like only when things start to peek up it's like wait what is this this is a good good shiny thing and I think that's his T is like I think some ultimate Talent beside being you know a really good politician I think is that uh he has that like you know the vision around like okay what actually is gonna make what's actually gonna work and and I think like that's also superpower you know to to be able to do that and um and but I also think you know people just love open AI brand uh but my my theory is that we're soon gonna see a a shift and I already kind of start seeing it like I remember like you know there was a time where everybody was prising open AI they couldn't do nothing wrong they were like you know Gods Among Us and if you look at the sentiment right now it's a little change it's a little like oh okay guys you know you you love this model you're not a Le better model you're doing these things and and I think that that's just like you know the just the natural cycle of big companies and I you know I saw that on Facebook too when during the election I went from a time where everybody Lov Facebook and it was like a a proudful thing to say that you wor have Facebook then like oh my God don't say you work at Facebook because you know you ruin the world right and so it's it's uh and I'm I think the time is going to change and you know also Sam is gonna get some shift for something uh and it's just the natural cycle of things I mean samman is like exceptionally good at making products right because like it was his idea to do CH gbt because like everybody just wanted to do research and stuff and he was like no guys trust me like let's put this into a UI it will work and like basically all of the other leaderships like Greg blman IIA wanted to work work on better models and he was like let's just try this right and he was right yeah I I agree and sometimes you need I mean not sometimes most of the time you need the prodct person and honestly for me like the shocking thing about chbt and and I think people don't talk a lot about this is for the first time you had a product that reach uh I think like the fastest to reach uh 100 million user I think ever all of the benchmarks all of the milest yeah that didn't even have a landing page like like like think about it like like I come from you know a tech background I've been working in tech for 12 years I was lead Uber I was Ed of AI of a brex and like you know I I I I I I have I come from the school of thoughts that there's certain things that you have to do right landing page is one of the things you have to do if you want to have a successful product and here we have a product that you just log in and is a is a chat that takes the word by storm and uh that was a really good lesson to me personally because made me sort of like like going back and thinking about like what's truly meanful and what is not what is not and uh I'm I'm I'm really glad that it it did that and um yeah I mean that changed my life and I I think you know like I always look back at my life before sh GPT and after because like I've been working in AI like for like two years so like since like the the gpt3 API were available I went down like you know the rabie hole I think like everybody else in the space like trying to like reer understanding I told myself Transformer I told myself like how to create you know gbt from scratch like all those things that I think are important to like understanding what's going on in the in the back but it wasn't until chat gbt that it was this truly transformative moment where I was like holy [ __ ] like the word is never going to be the same and and and you know what's funny the last time I felt that was when I was in college and somebody handled me an iPhone 3GS for the first time and I remember holding and I was like like what is this and I and and I was a nuclear engineering by the way so I studed nuclear engineering school and uh I was like I'm gonna drop nucle engineer so I mean I graduated but I was like I'm gonna drop what I'm doing and spend my entire life devoting on building stuff of this thing and basically that's how I end up in Tech it was just truly like just the the shock of seeing an iPhone for the first time and that's the same shock I felt with chbt to the point at the time I was at brex and um I was like would it be funny if I make an a financial system that knows like your data but it behaves like a chbt but of course I buil it with the gpt3 API because you know we didn't hat GPT API at the time but I made it so it was like a a chop functionality and my you know my team was so excited about it they were like stop whatever you're doing you know now you're like you know you lead the the the the if or here and and and that's how that's only how I started it's like you know it's because I open chbt for the first time the day come out and uh it changed my life and I think it changed the life of a lot of people I mean I would say it changed my life not necessarily like the AI tool but like as you said the waking up like the AI Revolution is real like you have to do something in this field and like yeah it took me a few months to complete the transition but like yeah I I would say it did change my life as well do you remember what was the first thing you asked I don't know I uh I actually remember because uh I was I was like okay give me a script in the style of the start of the golf fellas which is one of my favorite movie yeah but about you know these three friends and so I describe me and my two best friends which actually now my my two co-founder in my company and he gave me this amazing script that started just like I don't if you ever watched the movie go fellas yeah I did and it just started like that it's like you know there's like it's like it was just me and my friend and we were trying to make it big and it was like whoa like and and that's truly the first thing I asked JT which is which is funny and then um and and then I just went into this Rabbit Hole of like really understand how to talk to the stools and like you know how do we make it more personalized and honestly like that that that light is what you know brought me to today building everr building uh all those like agent system I like um this uh chbt plugin that I built it's called the designer gbt that it's like one of the top gbt in the world I think now it's like more than 400,000 chats and but but it all started with this deep desire of taking those tools understand what they do and give it back to people basically yeah I mean I definitely resonate with that I I don't remember the first prompt but for me it's like it was more about just wanting to be part of the AI Revolution right because I was too young to be um in the internet Revolution the Doom bubble too young to be in the social media wave but like I was exactly the perfect age to be part of this R so like you know for me it's like I I almost had to do it it's it wasn't even like a choice right it's like even though I even though by switching I like completely destroyed my income because I had a a different channel that was doing really well I was like it doesn't even matter it's like five years 10 years from now it's just like being in the AI field I just knew it was the right choice I I agree and and I think you know your China is doing great too now so I think it was definitely a right choice and and at the same time like like what you say resonate a lot to me right because you're like hey you know like I am at this stage of my life and if I do this thing now like I can ride away as as long as as I can and and like imagine like you know six months from now a year from now when a better mod comes out like how much better set up you are than somebody that's never even interacted with with this thing right and um and and and to me like it really goes back to like I would say those like Epiphany moments that I had that it would they they really Define why I use those tools in my experience like I remember so this is actually really fun fun story before um chpt did the uh plug sorry the the custom GPT they have this thing called plugins which they miss now almost dead and yeah it's basically that yeah and I was like oh this is fun I want to start experimenting and so this is like you know we're still at 3.5 four wasn't even out yet if I remember correctly and um basically I made this this trbt plugin they use stability AI API and it creates images right and so you will talk to this this interface and it will give you image this is before Del was in the chat yeah yeah and I was like what like I was like wait a second it's understanding what I want and then I could I can never forget these two moments I say okay generate a picture of a pyate right so he makes the pyate picture using stab AI it's really cool porch of a p and then I say okay let me talk to this Pirate no I didn't say pirate I say let me talk to him and now all of a sudden he start talking with a pirate slang because you know he understood that this was an image of a pirate therefore like I didn't even have to ask you know let let him give a pirx he just got it right and I was like holy [ __ ] this is unreal and then the second like mind-blowing moment was I at the before I did the designer gbt custom gbt I made it as a plugin and I by accident I had both TG because at the time you can actually toggle multiple plugin at the same time I think it was like up to three or4 if I remember correctly and so I forgot to switch the image plugin and I tug in the design gbt plugin and so I was like okay give me a website about uh a design firm it makes up the website I click the website and there are images generated with the image plugin that I didn't even ask but he intelligently understood that's that he could have done it and actually I I'm actually upset that they dismiss the plugin because I actually wa were way more powerful than CT KAS cannot do that you have to like automatically like you have to tag the GPT that you want to use with another one but like it like the the plugins I think was so smart and they definitely did something there where they're like okay maybe this is a little too smart like how can he go by itself and and but that was truly like a mind-blowing moment for me and I was like wow I'm going to spend my entire life on on on these tools now I think um like the difference between people who don't care about Ai and like oh my God you know it's just whatever it's not that good yet and the people who are like no this is amazing is is the only difference I mean the main difference I would say is that the people who are who don't care about it look at the current version and all the all the flaws the people who are all in look at 5 years from now 10 years from now and see like where it's going not even caring about about the conversion really I mean obviously there's so much you can do today but like you know 6 months from now 12 month from now nobody knows where it will be so I think that's like probably the biggest difference and as you mentioned like cgb didn't have any landing pages any marketing or anything like that so like I think great product is all you need like at the end of the day if you have something truly amazing you just need one user what one user tells another one and it skills right so I think that was like the real secret that Sam understood and with the plugins I think uh like I agree with you that in order to be really useful it has to be like automatic it can be the user doing everything right it has to be like you say a request and then the AI understands okay there's actually this Plugin or this GPT that would be perfect for this and like it has database of millions of gpts it like the user you can expect the user to know everything right and to ask for everything exactly should be intelligently like like picking up the stuff and and and I think you say something very important there which is like you know there's some people that focus on the flaw and people that think in the future as a Founder myself now of an AI company actually I think like the most important thing you can do right now as somebody's building a product it's building I I I like to say build build for super intelligent so every feature we're building on ever right now is with gb6 in mind it's not wi 5 right like I'm like okay if I have the like you know the true like 2x Einstein on my disposal what are the things that I will do what are the how will I change this product how will I build this product and all that road maps uh it's you know going back to this idea of ACI like artificial creative intelligence it's all build with that and so it's I think like that's what people should do it's like it's like don't because this is truly the first time where like your features are not limited by Tech but they're limited by intelligence I mean I mean think about this for a second right it's like it's like me going back 10 years like and and you have a compy you have a company right and say and you and I talk to you you tell me I like hey uh you know like what what do you think it's like the biggest bottleneck for you and you probably would say like you know what like it's my employee like I I need you know 10 more employees or like that this guy this engineer is not as good as I hoped and I come back in time and I say in in 10 years from now that's not going to be a bottleneck for you anymore and you have to build your features thinking that you have the smartest employee in the world and and there's this one thing that uh same Sam Al say that really lening with me in in this interview he said there's gonna be a person there's going to be a billionaire by running a company by itself yeah and I could not agree with that and uh I think we're gonna approach in that and Canali where this is gonna uh Happ and to and and you know even looking at myself not a billionaire uh but you know like I build like probably like 25 apps in the past like nine months and and I did it a this super human speed because I use you know a lot of this AI tool to help myself coding and set up the system and I mean even design gbt was done by GT4 I just told him what I wanted and he spit out for me and you know even the system level thinking it did that and and and and so like I I think you know we we are uh you should always build your life towards you know this concept of like super intelligence basically yes it's basically thinking as longterm as possible right so like this is this concept in business and it like whoever thinks more longterm usually wins like it's more important than work EIC or you know whatever it's just like if somebody thinks like okay CH gbt today or gbt is whatever like this month next month whoever thinks about like five years 10 years is going to destroy that person even if he doesn't work as hard or like isn't as capable it's because just like you know it focusing on the shortterm it's like the Reas the reason why the poest people live paycheck to paycheck is that they cannot you know save up and see like it saving this 10% will leave to life in a few years right so like thinking more longterm is almost always um better but like most people struggle with it I agree I agree that's the yeah it's definitely the most the the most important thing yeah I mean for me I would say like that similar moment uh was when I had C GPT actually write a Chrome extension for me and back then I didn't know anything about JavaScript like completely clues about that so I was like I was just like Okay can it do this and I described it I had some problem like logging into miio where every time I just to type in my email and it was like so annoying because uh I couldn't like it was taking like 10 seconds but like I I had to do it every day so it's you know over time it just adds up right I was like oh my gosh it's so annoying can I create a Chrome extension with that with cgbd and like in like five minutes I had it working I was like dude this is crazy like yeah like that that's that's insane yeah like when when you do your first working end to endend um thing with like any AI tool it's it's such a weird um and and and that's also why I love my asro is it's like you know it it spits up a folder with with like the files and they all s in and it's just it's just magical like like uh it's it's it's it's wild what is um so I suppose like you still use a lot for coding would that would that be your main user case for interfacing with the tools for GPT yeah or like in general we like we use AI for it's like probably just like no probably just like assisting in like writing and like summarizations like going through um you know I had this contract with a marketing agency it wasn't really long it was like still 10 pages but like you know the contracts how they're written it's like sentences with like eight commas in them it's like oh my God what is this saying and I just put it there and it's like you know explains in simple terms stuff like that uh I mean just daily day use cases I would say for coding it's more like the co-pilot extension inside of vs code so I mean that's probably the biggest help for coding yeah okay I want to actually touch on this concept like you said uh you know with building with super intelligence in mind and this reminded me of the concept idea from BAGI sasan where um the smart get smarter right so the everybody knows like the rich get richer where like people who are Rich has extra money to invest and that makes them richer the smart get smarter is basically a New Concept with AI where people who are learning about it who are at The Cutting Edge who are trying to you know be as as smart as possible they are going to be so far ahead of the average person who's like yeah AI I've heard it's going to change the world but whatever it's not that good I've tried chbd fre version so like I think what are your thoughts about it do do you agree with the smart get smarter concept and like how can the average person like do something basically I I agree and I'm GNA give you uh an example from sci-fi okay so have you ever watched the movie at it's a beautiful movie uh it's it's based on this story so there's this this writer called Ted and he wrote this book called uh story of your life and other and Other Stories if I remember the thing correctly but that's what the movie arrival I think I've seen this yeah yeah yeah and so without spawning this movie basically in the movie they they hired this the most like the the most expert linguistic person in the world to understand the alien language right and and basically just by communicating with those aliens she kind of gained superpower that's sort of like the the the time the the plot and there is this concept in neuropsychology uh where if you can speak different languages actually your brain thinks differently in different languag so I I I'm Italian right I speak that's my that's my mod Tong and then of course you know I'm I think I'm proficient in English and two different people when I speak in Italian when I speak in English it's very interesting right I'm sure I'm sure like you probably different too when um and uh and it's and I was like I was thinking about this and I was like you know now I'm basically speaking a lot to this uh quote unquote alien language I call it alien not because it's seual terrestrial but more so like it's something that wasn't existing on the planet we made it right it's something that wasn't supposed to be here we created it and already start seeing how like my my thought process has changed a lot in like you know the two years or more that I've interacting with tools like I give you an example like in the past if I was to solve a problem I would go very like hey to be right and I will think about you know how do I reach B faster and now because I I don't see like a goal as in one liner I see it more as like an exploration of different like you know possibility I I go from like a to A1 to A1 B to A1 C to a until I get to my goal and I it's truly change my fa process because when you have basically something where you can brainstorm you can simulate scenario like like I simulate scenario from my company I go here and I'm like hey uh this is exactly what my company does simulate scenario are this amount of user this amount of user and and and you know it's just like it's incredible right so I I think it's like it's uh am I getting smarter is my IQ getting higher probably not I I don't know but I'm definitely getting like something that I couldn't never get before which is like disability of approaching problem in a different way and solving them in a different way and I think like that's what's going to make people different and I and I see it all the time like my friends in my group of friends I'm like they call me the high guy right it's funny but I just like love this stuff right and like I'm always the guy that ask like hey Petro like I have to do this thing like you know how can I do it and then here I am just read a prompt and it's like you know a 20 line prompts whatever and it works and they you know they get shot but that's because I think like I've been talking so much with this machines that now my brain is tuned to speak like them and if you can speak this new language then you get better too um and so I I I I truly I truly believe in that yeah I have so many things written down so okay the last thing you said if you can speak this you get better I mean I absolutely agree but like why is there so many people that's like oh why would you learn how to prompt you know what's the point of this when AGI is coming soon like there is so much uh pessimism like around learning new skills and like I just don't understand it because my simple framework is like you're never going to you know get worse by knowing more skills like yeah no I I agree I I think okay I think there's two things it's like one learning a new skill is just hard right like like I think like you have to be a very specific type of person to be like I want to learn something new that's just so you're already dealing with like a small percentage um from a pure like prompt engineering perspective I still believe prompts uh it's like a bioproduct of us using these tools for the first time like an example that I love to use a lot it's like when the first iPhone came all the interface looked like real elements right you have like something that looks like w it was a SCH morphic UI right it looks like wood and paper and that's because like we never interact with something that was touch until that point and so we needed some ideas that we are familiar with like books of pages of a book and like stuff like that to understand how to use it and in my perspective prompt is like that it's like this is not maybe the best way to interact with these tools but we are limited right now because that's how we our technology is shaped us and so but at the same time I don't think it's a bad skill to learn because at the end of the day it will always be even if you have a gii you still have to be able to ask a gii what you want like like like I feel like you know how many stories and legends and like fairy tales you have or people asking the genie for a desire for for a wish but then they formulate the wish in a wrong way and the genie end up like killing some people in their family or you know turning their house on fire right and like I see that like that it's like it's like even if you have a genie that can do whatever you desire you still have to be able to ask your wish in the right way understand how yeah how it works and so I think like prompt engineer is a it's it's it's a great skill to learn and it's like when Andre kardy tweeted it was like English is the hardest uh like you know developing language yeah I I I agree I think that's I think that's true yeah I mean I absolutely agree I think it's just like probably you're right it's it's learning new skills and somebody's like rather than go through that pain or discomfort of learning your skill and like sucking at it at first people are just like ah yeah why I learn that AGI is coming soon it's like it's useless it's like so many things it's like I don't know there's so much um I don't know this is almost like syndrome where people just like they they see something they understand the potential of it but like they make a like small decision that they're not going to pursue it so the only alternative is to hate on it right yeah I agree and and I think you know that's that's what difference differ like a successful person from from you always have to be open-minded and you know understand like what the word around you is changing and and make the best out of it when you said that you're two different people based on English or Italian like I absolutely agree when I have this I have this AI community and every now and then somebody joins who's from Czech Republic and they want to talk to me in Czech and my brain is almost incompetent talking about AI in Czech I like can we just talk in English please like it's so funny to say that because like I um so because you know work in a high here in Italy I'm like an expert because you know they're so behind unfortunately and uh but which is sad because there was such a some of the best researcher actually especially in the image uh generation world that in Italy but like I the I've been interviewed for Italian TV like like a like a few times at this point and I hated it because I just want to talk in English also like if you say things like uh yeah prompt engineering or you know learn they just sounds so weird ohing it sounds like it sounds like something that like from the 18th century when people trying to describe like a like a steam engine right and so it's um yeah it's funny I I I I and but at the same time I'm also more competent in English like I feel like I don't speak Italian like at all now I only when I talk to my family and I when I speak Italian I feel like I feel like a kid I feel like oh do you say this correctly it's just it's so funny and I left my country when I was uh 18 uh um but yeah it's it's funny yeah I mean I I felt the same way when I last year I spent like five weeks in Paris and when I came back my check was like bad I was like oh my God like you really can like lose skill of language when you don't practice it yeah okay so another thing that I wanted to say is like fundamental AI beliefs right so I feel like um the main belief I I always tell people is that all you have to understand is that technology always keeps improving like we cannot predict the how fast things will happen or whatever but like the only thing you just like look at is that is this going to get worse no is this going to stop well probably not like just all the exponentials going in more people going in computers are improving so many things are improving so when you understand this one belief that technology always keeps improving the the next thing you have to do is just like okay are you going to fight it are you going to be one of those like anti- AI people that try to stop it like just look at all the previous techn and where like the lit or whatever where where the those groups of people ended up fighting a new technology or like the people that were hating on cars because they thought that like horses are just better like it never works right so I think that's the one belief that technology always keeps improving and once people truly understand that like the only way to do that is to embrace it that's the only path forward yeah but also I think interesting thing too that I've been seeing right now is uh it's not like pessimist per se but some people have disbelief now that we might Plateau soon where we non exponential right and and and to me like an interesting thing about this I was thinking about the other day was like what what if the limit of intelligence is human intelligence right never ask oursel this question it's like what if like it's almost like you know the the speed of light is the Conant in the universe it's the in the universe what if the human intelligence is the highest form of intelligence like we can't we know we can't prove that right and so yeah and that's what it gets interesting where it's like oh wait maybe maybe with my Plateau but but for my mind and going back to what you're were saying it's always better to B the opposite bat where it's like you know there there was this philosopher in the 18th century his name was Pascal which one one of my favorite philosophy he was an atheist but he had this this this best yeah like the the godb right like it's always better to believe there's a paradise because at least you get to ask like a good person right yeah and uh and and I think like this applies here too it's like yeah I mean I could think that this Plateau I could think that it's gonna it's not gonna get better but why I can bet it's gonna get better and I and um and and and to me like the other interesting thing about this thing that I think people don't talk enough too it's like it's like we create intelligence so it's almost like intelligence and Consciousness is not necessarily related like right we're getting to a point where like we have make intelligence out of rocks and maybe Consciousness is not like an an inertive part of being intelligence it might be something else that we don't know it's the soul it's the whatever you want to call it right and so it's uh it's it's very interesting I think we also getting to a point where the more we explore those tool the more we get to the limits of what we could do the more actually we're going to understand about oursel and I think also something that I tell people too when like they're afraid of talking tobt or like these things and the things I always say it's like hey think about this this is the very first time in the history of humanity where to understand a technology it's not about understanding a piece of tech necessarily or piece of code it's about understanding how to be human right because if you know what it means to be human if you know what it means to talk to humans there there's a high chance that you're going to be successful in the ipace too and and this is why I believe like this is truly the era for like ideal people the creative people the designers because those are the people that were always thinking with the best people interest in mind and if you know how to be empathetic to people and you know how to speak to people you're probably going to be very successful with AI um and and at the same time you know you can always bet that it's gonna get better yeah it's like so many people are like um you know why be a like why learn programming like programming is like going be that but like as you said it's about being a builder like someone who has an idea and makes it happen right so I think like for me this is how I rank how good of a programmer somebody is it's not like whether they know all the syntax in seven different languages or can write in assembly it's like what have you made like which products have you built that people actually like and I don't even care if you had to like look up all the you know syntax online like if you actually made something I think that's a good programmer I agree and like even you know when I think of myself like you know I I never really touch python until like I started building eye product and you know like now my asro won the the the code thing for anthropic and I'm I'm I'm like very proud of that because it's like that wasn't even my language but it's it's something that I I go better with AI and uh and and and I think you know that that that tells right it's like it's like you can be successful I I think now we live in a time where you can be successful anything you want if you just set your mind straight and use those tool to to learn and like be better I absolutely agree so super intelligence you you mentioned you think about it a lot how can people prepare themselves for super intelligence or for the Post AGI World totally so this is the way I see it right so a lot of people are scared that they're going to lose their jobs and and and and trust me there's going to be a big part of that but what I go what I tell to people is take those skills that you are irreplaceable at whatever that is you any job you do take the skills you're irreplaceable on and start to being really good with those skills you're replaceable at using those tools so basically not let this tool do the things that you replaceable all just get even better right like like like if you are uh a 10x uh JavaScript developer become a THX javascri devel if you are a 10x Rider becomes an under X Rider right and and and so I think like if you have this mindset where it's like okay because like the thing is like you this this might be like the controversial thing I actually think you're going to be the place at the things you're not good at right and like like that that makes sense you why would you do them like you know right right you're gonna be the so it's but if you're really good at something if you're a great Salman if you're a great writer if you're a great doctor and and to me like for example a great doctor is somebody that it's like you know it's EMP atic knows as to speak to people it's not just about what he knows but it's about you know the the human side of things like like yes we might have you know like lm's doctor in the future for like tele tele medicine and all the stuff but like like the that sort of human touch that's never going to be the place right and so it's like take the things you do well be better at of yourself and then just like exponentially be better with like Ai and and I think like that's how you need to prepare yourself because if AI drops tomorrow I know exactly what I will do with a GI I will take everything that I good at which is idation and and and product and execution and just one 100x that and if you are a copywriter you're scared AGI is gonna do all the C view not at all just you have a style that can be replaced you have a tone that can be replaced just use this GI to you know instead of creating uh one page of website every day now you're doing 100 right um and and that's the way I I I will approach this but like you know having just having that mindset is so rare because like that instantly what Pops to mind is like like The Meta skills of like you know I embrace new technology I learn new things I build stuff like those meta skills are like almost more important than the actual technical skills of like you know being a good copywriter being a Salesman programmer whatever do you agree with that yeah I I agree because like because because that's like what you need now right like uh what you need now it's not like being extremely good at something is to be good at something but then understanding how to enhance it right and uh as you say I think it takes you know a really special kind of person with that like like one thing I always like to think back it's like the Renaissance right like I think there such an interesting time like you have this time where like everybody was like an artist everybody was a genius every like I saw uh you know like uh there's this very fun tweet that is uh the two to-do list of Lardo DaVinci from like a day 14th century and in this to-do list there's things like as the measurements of the sun to this person uh map Milan so I can build the canals uh ask uh some like you know chemical process you know to some other person I was like oh my God this guy would have loved like like if he was born right now right what could have done like what an amazing thing you could have done it right and and and I think like to be human is to really it's to really understand knowledge and embrace knowledge and be get get better at knowledge right and and I think like there's never been a better time to be knowledgeable of something and to to to expand your Horizon and to be better and I and I think if we all do it we can literally like you know enter this new Renaissance Era where we all we we're all doing something that we are excited about we're all doing something that we're proud about we are now limited by by money I I really believe like if AI is achieved correctly like we can gonna enter one of the most Prosper era of all time granted it's going to be a part of the world that's probably not going to happen for a long time but I think that's just the nature of things um and uh and we should be respectful that of course but but I believe that's the that's going to be the the future of things I think to achieve that kind of Renaissance we almost like need to switch the societal position to like entrepreneurship sh like people experimenting because when I read the Walter isacson book about DaVinci it was like love the times when he grew up and like the how Society F of things like I think if he grew up now he wouldn't be like Da Vinci CU like back then he was like encourage to go outside to you know look at the butterfly to explore the cave and it was like just you know to experiment stuff now it's like everybody just go to the same school just follow the same path and it's only like you have to fight and like be lucky to get that random Youtube recommendation on or to get that random person on Twitter to like kind of switch your thinking it's like oh there is this second world of people who are building experimenting cuz like the mainstream societ is like so limited just like follow the path follow this and do this don't go off the path that's actually a beautiful example and and and yeah I I I read that that book too and it's also so interesting to see how like a lot of the reason why it was also successful it was because it was it was neged like it was like he didn't have really family like son yeah yeah it was an unwanted child right and um I I I I think there is a power in be by yourself and be a free thinker and and like all of those things and uh and and yeah you're right like people just like sometimes they try try to follow a path but but now you can yeah like like if we teach people that all of them can can forge their own path and they don't have to be worried about like societal warm like all this kind of stuff I think like everybody will be so much more happier and and and the word will benefit because you will have more people building fun stuff and art and and things that feeds our soul you know um yeah it's crazy to think that if Da Vinci was actually the firstborn son son the legiate legitimate son he would be sent to that um I think was like some school or something for like religion or whatever and he wouldn't have that freedom to explore and you know be a poth so it's kind of crazy that just like being born as a second child and like not being wanted like created perhaps the greatest Genius of all time I mean there's like so many example in history right it's like it's like Steve Jobs like that too uh you know adopted he have a very loving family but I think like growing up and as an adopted child it puts something on you right it puts a stigma on you and uh uh you know mask is another great example horrible family situation uh it's like you know the relation with his father is like very interesting so it's like yeah it's uh there's defin common denominator in having a bad child Orie I don't I don't know what talks about people um hopefully we can you know we can all be better at that but uh yeah it's interesting okay so I actually have to run in a bit U I have two questions or I guess three questions about ever art designer gbt and Maestro so what what is your main project out of these is it ever art yeah so ever art is my company that I found with my two best friends and it's basically the combination of all those things thinkings that I explore in the past two years and of course the things that we've been talking about because you know AI is like extremely powerful tool they can do so much with it but once again as we discussed today it's like really hard to use for some people right and especially when it comes to image generation like if if you go to the m Journey all the sort of like text to uh image the standard text to image generation tool even if you're incredible appr prompting it's really hard that you get what you want if you have like a specific style like let's say you're like a photographer that does a very specific style it's basically impossible to recreate this with you know other tools and so ever art solves that problem from for artists Brands Corporation where you come to my platform and it's super easy you drag and drop you know 10 to 15 images of something that you want to train your model on and we support model train on style Persona and uh uh Pro like object like like a product and so you train a model on on these three different things that you want and then you basically have your own custom model which one you feel more empowered to use because it has your data so you can use the data that comes out of it because the model has changed so much it's truly yours and two it's much easier to use right because you don't have to say complex thing for example one thing that our customer are blowing away with it's like if you're training a model on this like there's like this alcohol brand that is not up and that this like beautiful photography that they posted on Instagram they train them all on that and now all they have to say it's like a glass on a table and it's like boom It's like because the model has such a good visual understanding of you know like your style and I I truly believe and and every company that we talk to what they say that we have the best fine tune technology we actually even stability AI approached us and they were like guys I don't know how you did it you know it's like and and and this is truly like you know sleepless night like going to sleep at 5: a every night for months uh training a thousand model get a feeling for what makes a difference in in a good model in a bad model and in a way like a company like ever art shouldn't even exist because each model it's like so complex and each model it's his own case but we basically come up with a formula that truly no one has at this point that you can apply to any type of fine tuning it would just be perfect um or as close as it gets with today technology and that's also another thing that we think about you know like those in those image model they're just as good as they are now you know stability 3 just dropped it's going to It's amazing And you know whatever this the four and five and um it's just going to get better and um and you know we've been seeing like a lot of success for our customer we have at this point I think we have that they're like training like 20,000 models something like that it's crazy like 20,000 unique image models on the platform and um I'm really sorry I I really have to run I I will link every art in the description and I would love to do this again in a month or so if you're down yeah yeah I enjoy this conversation so much P but I I have a football match I really have to go yeah no no no worries and yeah this was super fun and thanks thanks for taking the time yeah"
