        "transcript": "jet GPT has finally released their memory update they're just starting to roll it out to free and plus users in small amounts but what this memory update means is that Chad GPT now has the ability to have a memory database of everything that it's learned about you and I know that may sound scary but this is going to be very useful because it does this automatically all you have to do is prompt and Chad gbt can pick up little things about you over time and the more you start utilizing memory and chat GPT the more tailored their responses are going to be automatically and this is going to dramatically improve the outputs of chat GPT according to open AI you're going to see a lot of improvements in your chats over time the more you actually utilize memory so let me show you this memory being used in action if I'm in chat GPT now in the regular GPT 4 model I could say something like I love cats and I want to get one what are the five most friendly breeds of cats and I can send that off and as you can see GPT will now have this little section right here that says memory updated love cats and is interested in getting one so as you can see chat GPT is gaining this memory just for me typing in a prompt and it's doing all of this automatically so now chat gbt knows when I go into a different chat thread let's just say and I say something like what animals do I love and I can send that off and based on my knowledge database chat gbt says you love cats because cuz it's gained that memory from a past chat thread and I can keep on going on about this it says are you thinking about getting one or do you already have a feline friend I could say something like I want to get one but I haven't moved out yet and I can send that off and then chat gbt will gain even more memory about me and it goes on prompting like normal but now it says it's interested in getting the cat but hasn't moved out yet right so this is actually very very cool and it's already starting to gain a lot of information about something it's a little small and a little bit sillier but when you start implementing this with your workplace or your projects this can become very powerful because it's going to eliminate that need for you to type in your situation every single time before every single prompt I could just keep going on I could say I want a maincoon something like that and now it knows that is interested in getting a maincoon cat so it's very interesting to see how it can pick up on a bunch of different things about you from a single chat so this is very cool but how do we actually enable and disable this well I can show you that now it's very simple just like any other chat gbt feature there's not much messing around in order to get to those settings so what you have to do is you have to head over here to your sidebar and open it up and go down to where your personal account is and from there what you can do is go to settings and in settings under the general section you'll see something called personalization you can click that and this is where you view enable and disable all of your memory that chat GPT is gained so if I wanted to I could just disable that and keep in mind that turning off memory doesn't delete your memory but it stops chat GPT from putting new memory in your database and actually utilizing it for your next chat thread so this is very simple if you want memory on you can change it on if you want it off change it off if you want to manage your memory and actually delete some memory uh what you can do is you can hit this manage button under the memory section and personalization when you hit manage as you can see you have all of your data right here that it's gained on from the past so it says loves cats and is interested in getting one but hasn't moved out yet is interested in getting a mun cat you can come in here and you can delete these maybe I don't want a maincoon cat anymore I can come in here and I delete it and then I can X out and now chat gbt doesn't think that I want a maincoon cat so you can kind of manage your memory like that now let's just say you have a task that you want to complete that you don't want to utilize your memory for but what you can do rather than going back and turning it off and then turning it back on is head up to your model selector so I'm going to select GPT 4 and then there's this new section called temporary chat what you can do is you can activate that and as you can see they won't appear in your history you will have no memory and it won't use or create your memories and there's going to be no model training so this is just a very barebones version of chat GPT but keep in mind that your chats are not going to appear in your history so if you want something to stay in your history but you don't want to use memory then you're going have to go in your settings and shut it off temporarily then I'm going to hit continue and now as you can see we are in a temporary ch chat and we can just message Chat gbt like normal now this is another way that you can add memory to chat gbt and you can feed it some information if you want you can just go through here and list everything that you want in the memory section within your prompt bar you don't just have to prompt over time and get your memory slowly generated through multiple prompts but what you can do is you can just instantly CH chat gbt about yourself so I could say something like this I have an artificial intelligence Channel and I could say on YouTube called AI foundations and I can send that off and it will automatically update my memory I don't just have to prompt like normal and ask a question or give a command but as you can see it's going to ask me further questions about what my channel is and therefore its memory will be updated even more so what kind of content do you focus on for AI foundations mainly chat GPT but I am pushing more towards General AI here soon and I can send off that basic information about myself and it's memory data base is just going to continue to expand you can also hover over this hit manage memories so you can kind of go through this question analysis with chat GPT and that would be a way that you could gain memory very quickly but what I think this is going to be most useful for is those who are just prompting over time and Chad gbt is slowly gaining a lot of information about every sector of their life and more of these long-term Moes in your life these things that you have a lot of data into you've prompted about a lot Chad GPT will be able to contain that information in its memory database therefore making it much more useful now with that being said that's all I have on this update video there's not much to it but it is a very very powerful feature but learning how to use it it's not that hard I just wanted to bring you this video to Showcase different ways different ideas and different thoughts behind using it now if you do like chat gbt and you want to learn it in depth from a toz I do have a chat gbt Mastery course in community with well over 520 members now Community is growing we're getting stronger every day so if you want to join that I'll leave a link in the description or the top pin comment and with that being said I hope you enjoyed this new memory update I'm sure I'm going to be using it quite a bit and just improving my chat GPT model so that it knows more about me automatically rather than me having to type in this context every single time subscribe to the channel and like this video if you want to see more chat GPT update videos all right I'll see you in the next video"
