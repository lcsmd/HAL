        "transcript": "I have finally received beta access to mulon the newest autonomous AI agent that is able to navigate the web and do tasks for you on your behalf I had to wait a long time for this beta access nearly 24 hours now which is like 10 years in AI time but now I got to say I'm very impressed this is right now the best AI agent of its kind so we've tested multiple ones on this channel and you know some were good some were bad but often times I found like the agent had trouble reasoning about stuff it had trouble making the right decisions one thing that I immediately noticed mulon is it seems really good at making the right decisions it decides on what it needs to do it takes whatever task you give it breaks it up into chunks into you know step-by-step subtasks that have to be completed it thinks about the things that can go wrong it's like if this goes wrong this is what I need to do if this goes wrong this is what I need to do and then it freaking executes now lower your expectations a little bit because it's not perfect it still runs into issues but here's the important thing to understand notice that a lot of these issues aren't really AI related so it's not the AI misunderstanding something most of this seems to be Tech issues since this is a chrome plugin an add-on right if it determines in order to complete this thing I need to click on this red button and then tries to click on it it can't that's not really a failing of the AI to to figure out which button to click it's it's some tech issue behind the scenes either a security issue with the Chrome browser or some weird Tech issue with the website it doesn't matter those things can be fixed and they will be fixed I feel like the development team is uh pretty solid in this one so when it can't complete a task because it can't click on something just just chalk that up to glitches and bugs that will be ironed out within the next maybe few weeks even and ask yourself this as this thing is reasoning about what to do and what buttons to click how how it would go about completing the task is it doing it as good as a human being is it failing at any of the reasoning steps take a look in my last video I said 2024 is the year of the autonomous AI agent this thing is a taste of things to come it's still beta it's not like 100% there you still can't use it for just whatever you want and not pay attention to it but boy are we getting close we're so close and keep in mind so with this thing it has this teach me button so this button basically allows you you click it on and then you go through the website and you show it when to click on what to do and then you click it off and now it knows that skill so next time you needed to do something on that website it knows how to do it it will follow your commands now the weight list for this thing I think they had something like 20,000 people on there I don't know exactly if that's correct numbers or not but the point is as a bunch of people Pile in here and they all teach this thing various skills on various websites Etc it will keep getting better and better we are so close to fully autonomous AI agents and this thing is just a taste of things to come so check it out let me know what you think please hit Thumbs Up And subscribe if you as well as I aspire to control your very own Army of autonomous AI agents a swarm of AI agents if you will because that's that's what we're here for all right let's dive in so in the future you're probably going to be able to get mulon from their website or just straight from the Google store or whatever other avenues they have available but if you're watching this now as they're trying to release this thing there's kind of a lot going on so the best way to do it is to join their Discord Channel if you don't have disc ORD you probably should get Discord because at this point a lot of good stuff happens on Discord it's a good thing to be on it's free it has a bunch of channels that you can talk to with other people a lot of AI tools run on Discord exclusively once you get there you know there's some announcements announcements demos getting started official links Etc you know here are all the official links and then what you do is you go to Beta request and then click access beta now you put in some information then once you're in you'll get a link to their Chrome web store where you can add to Chrome it's going to ask you to log in you have to verify your email and then once that's done you are ready to go and complete the profile for a personalized experience skills that you can teach multi on now let's go to the new tab you are now exploring the web of Agent Zero a user facing demonstration of multi on agent technology all right so this is kind of the main page it has some pre-build commands here so let's try and make a tweet about multi let's try that so at this point I'm not doing anything I'm not touching anything it created the tool and it just went ahead and posted it all right I kind of assume that it would pause and be like are you cool with this should I continue but it just went ahead and posted it which uh I guess that's fine go to instacart and order from Costco order me bananas and water let's go so it's thinking about it it's navigating to instacart you clicks on the Costco I'm clicking on the Costco link to shop from Costco on instacart as per the current objective to order bananas and water via instacart so they're clicking on ADD I'm clicking on the add button for the organic bananas £3 to add them to the cart as it is part of the current objective to order bananas and water from Costco via instacart clicking on the water and sparkling water section to find water to add to the cart as it is the remaining item needed to complete the current objective I'm clicking on the add button for the arrowhead mountain spring water 16.9 flos 40 CT to add it to the cart this is the water item needed Costco via in cart I am clicking on on the go to checkout button to proceed with the checkout process for the bananas and water that have been added to the cart as per the current object all right I'm going to pause it right there cuz I don't want it checking out for me uh I like how it like narrates through what it's doing I guess that could get pretty obnoxious but so far it's it's really good because it's walking me through what it's doing cuz sometimes it's the text here run so fast that you might not be able to to follow what's happening effectively and you can turn it off here if you wanted to so let me go back but I got got to say I'm kind of blown away because it ordered 3 lbs of organic bananas some Arrowhead mountain spring water it went through it so fast instacart has these little popups with their stupid tips that they have on there that I hate and I always it kind of frustrates me because it has their little promotional stuff whatever this thing just like cuts through it since it's a chrome plug-in I don't think it even has to interact with the pop-ups it just it can click on any element even if these guys covered up so it just like goes behind it clicks on the element so it's like un stoppable it just keeps as soon as the element loads it's able to interact with it and by element I mean like this water so for example if I wanted to click on this water and a popup comes up I couldn't click on the water because it would be in front of it right this thing just just clicks on whatever it wants whether it's visible to me or not which is not going to say I like that how about this go to Twitter and find the latest post by Sam Alman so it opens it up to Sam alting to Sam alman's Twitter profile to find the latest post as per the current objective so I hit the daily limit so by by the way this this thing is free so everything that I've done so far is free I did some testing beforehand that was not on camera so probably good 10 20 minutes of using this thing but it sounds like I I hit the rate limit and I can try again in 3 hours here is the page so it looks like let's see So Pro 19 bucks a month unlimited requests per day or 150 bucks a year I got to say so I've just started using it but based on what I'm seeing so far that I mean that is a killer app I'm very very impressed so I'm going to change my plan here in a second but looks like the the mode that we're on is standard so it's not even the fast one like it's going so fast but there's fast ludicrous and uh mystery mode whatever that is so and you have you have voice mode theme language Etc you can add some personalization details so it knows like what email to use what Zoom to use Etc and these are the taught skills the the skills that you have taught it that I haven't done that yet but that's coming all right but let's try it again now that I have unlimited posts go to Twitter and find the latest post by samman I'm navigating to Sam alman's Twitter profile to find the latest post by him I'm clicking on the posts tab on samman's Twitter profile to view his latest tweets I'm scrolling down on Sam alman's Twitter profile to reveal more of his latest tweets and find the most recent one I have found the latest post by Sam ultman on his Twitter profile yes that's perfect it uh it found it and it kind of centered the screen on it so I guess guess if I want it open I would say open it so let's see open photo P open new image with YouTube thumbnail Dimensions so photo is a free alternative to photoshop that's completely online and you know when you're opening a new one they're saying like what dimensions do you want so we'll say the YouTube thumbnail Dimensions so this is photo P so it opens up a new project and here I'm clicking on new project to create a new image with specific dimensions it did it holy crap I'm clicking on the create button to open a new image with the dimensions already set for a YouTube thumbnail 1,200 180x 720 pixels it it nailed it that is scarily good I got to say how about find an image of an elephant and add it to that image so it's thinking it's going to go to pixabay or unsplash find the image on there search for elephant you know it sounds like it wants to save it in the system you know save it on the desktop or something like that save it on my computer and then post it in there so here it is it goes to pixabay and now it will I assume search for elephant I'm typing elephant into the search box to find images of elephants on Pixel Bay I am clicking on the search input field to ensure that the text elephant is entered correctly for the image search I'm clicking on the search button to initiate the search for elephant images on pixabay all right so I found a picture of an elephant and it's going to click download all right so it open up photo again so it's having some issues clicking on the file so it's restarted it looks like and now it's going to try to do it again I'm refreshing the photop page to reset the interface and attempt to open the file menu again I'm attempting to open the file menu in photopia to access the options for importing the downloaded elephant image I'm clicking on open from computer to import the downloaded elephant image into photopia so it ran into an issue actually it's smart enough to figure out that you know it's running into an issue so was able to refresh the page try again now I know it can do this so I'm not sure what so I'm not sure what the problem is all right let's try something else so we're going to open up Discord open the mid Journey bot and generate the image of an elephant so I'd be very surprised if you can do that cuz you have to know the exact commands in Discord in order to interface with with mid Journey so it might I'm I'm I'm going to assume I'm going to assume it won't be able to do that but I am navigating to the Discord login page to begin the process of opening the mid Journey bot and generating the image of an elephant I am clicking on the mid Journey bot direct message to open the chat with the bot and generate the image of an elephant I am sending a command to the mid Journey bot to generate an image of an elephant could you please check if the mid Journey bot has generated an image of an elephant and let me know if the task has been completed success F so it did really well so it knew that slash imagine is the way to to make that happen so if you start typing slash imag you have to select the correct command it just wrote SL imagine an elephant so so it's asking me you know did I completed successfully I'm going to say no once you type SL imagine then you have to hit tab to select that command then type in what you want to make I'm submitting the command to the mid Journey bot to generate an image of an elephant I'm following the user's instruction to hit tab after typing SL imagine to select the command then typing in an elephant to specify what image the mid Journey bot should generate and finally submitting the command I'm submitting the command to the mid Journey bot to generate an image of an elephant all right I'm going to stop it right there so it's running to an issue so basically what it's supposed to do is type in Imagine right and then click on this thing and then this appears prompt and then you type in your prompt well let's do teach me it's saying please type in the command you would like to teach me I'm going to say make mid Journey image please click the start teaching button button to teach me so we're going to go here we're going to say slash imagine we're going to hit I'm clicking on the chat input to ensure that the command SL imag is ready to be used I selecting the SL imagine command from the autocomplete all right so it's a little bit confusing so you got to hit the start teaching button here so we're going to hit that we're going to click here we're going to type in slash imagine then we're going to hit tab then the prompt appears then we're going to hit finish teaching and then we're going to say rerun with taught actions so make mid Journey image of an elephant and we're going to hit play please click the start teaching button to teach me okay so this the interface still under construction so it's a little bit weird it's a little bit unintuitive sometimes so once you're done with that it sounds like you have to click like the teach me you have to click it off then we're going to say make mid Journey image of an elephant and then we're going to click play and let's see what it does here I'm going to delete this I'm sending a message to the mid Journey bot to create an image of an elephant as per the all right so let's try again make M Journey image of an elephant I'm clicking on the link provided by the mid Journey bot to view the image of an elephant that was requested which will verify that the message has been properly sent and the task has been completed could you please confirm if the image generated by the mid Journey bot and Linked In the message with ID 163 is of an elephant let's try this go to Reddit and open the top post under hot in the singularity subreddit all right so it opened up Reddit it found the singularity subreddit I'm clicking on the top post titled A official R Singularity Discord server link to open it as per the objective to view the top posts under hot in the singularity I'm scrolling down to view more top posts under hot in the singularity subreddit as per the objective all right so it was able to do that but it clicked on the community announcement once so that's not quite what we wanted let's try this let's try this go to Reddit in the singularity subreddit find a post about GPT 5 all right there it is so was able to find it it opened it up fulfilling the current objective okay perfect I'm I'm going to pause that that's really really good all right let's try this open up Chad GPT and have a conversation with it but the best game development Studios argue with it and nitpick its answers all right let's let's see where this takes us so it's going to navigate to Chad GPT and it's again it's saying so it thinks through it like if we're not logged in we have to ask for the login Etc all right so now that it's uh thought through that a little bit it's I'm navigating to the open website to access the chat GPT inter all right so GPT says well the best that's that's hard to say and then so mulon goes well can you elaborate on what criteria using so CH GPT comes out with the criteria and you're saying that's a good start however Innovation alone doesn't make a studio the best how do you wait the importance of blah blah blah then we respond with well that's kind of subjective then answerers I understand the need for a balanced perspective all right I'm going to pause it so basically what it's doing is it just nitpicking every answer and tries to be tries to just like refr frame everything that Chad GPT says into something else if you've ever had one of those like battles online with people where you're arguing about something like politics this is 2 AI just replicated that perfectly but I got to say it's very impressive that it's able to to do all of that and have a back and forth conversation one thing that I noticed it looks like it is interrupting Chad BT so it's not really good at waiting for it to finish writing everything out I think it like hits stop or something or it just like puts in the new answer and then hits go so it interrupts chpt but I mean I got to say it executed everything pretty pretty well all right next let's do this use Gmail to send myself a reminder to take out the crash let's see what it does there so ideally it's going to open up Gmail and then just figure out what how to send itself an email so just use its own email address to send itself an email and then just write and you know take out the trash so it thinks through step by step what it has to do how it's going to go about doing it and once it has that to-do list it's going to open up Gmail which it did it hit compose and now it's filling it it went to the contact at natural 20 and it said don't forget to take out the trash and it hit send and there it is it's done let's say open up the information.com and get the top five headlines all right so it opened up information.com and it's memorizing the top five headlines which are basically the ones that I'm seeing here and and it did that so it looks so it looks like it went 1 2 3 4 and five so earlier it said it can't open up and interact with Google Docs so it's probably because it's a you know we're in a Chrome browser using a chrome plugin Google Docs is part of Google so there's probably some security issues there but let me see if if I open everything up for it can it write something in there right into Google's docs today's date and time so it's not able to touch Google Docs all right so go to go to perplexity Ai and search for what is a good alternative to Google Docs let's see what it does there all right so it went to perplexity AI it searched for what is a good alternative to Google Docs so the co-pilot is like do you want to refine that a little bit more and generally what you do here is you either select one of the options or you hit skip but it for some reason it's not able to hit skip so it's saying it's not working as expected so what it should have done is hit skip so for some reason didn't quite nail that but it knew what to do and it knew it couldn't do it so all right so basically I found this online notepad. org so basically I want be able to have mulon just jot down some notes as it's doing stuff it doesn't play with Google Docs so I just just for the testing purposes we're going to use this to kind of write stuff down all right so we're going to say find five news about Elon Musk and write the summaries in and I just posted that notepad. org that it can use so we're going to hit play it's going to use Google search to find the five latest articles about Elon Musk and then it's going to jot them down into that notepad that I gave it so it searched for Elon Musk news so it's reading the article it's memorizing it it all right so it memorized that whole article and now it's going to summarize it and write it in here into the online notepad and now it's selecting a second article to do it for some reason now it's huge I'm going to go ahead and stop it there because I think the point is is that it did it so it took that whole article it memorized the whole thing and went line by line kind of like copying and pasting it and was able to post that summary into the online notepad I got to say that's pretty impressive all right let's try this finalist video by PewDiePie pew PewDiePie on YouTube I'm not going to say YouTube let's see if it figures it out and copy the first minute of the transcript into that online notepad thing that we found so I think that's probably one of the most complicated ones that we gave it the most complicated prompt because we're saying not only go to YouTube figure out how to get the transcript which they kind of hit it now it's very it's kind of buried in there it's hard to find all right so it find found the PewDiePie channel so it's saying the transcript for PewDiePie's latest video is not available so it is we might have to teach it how how to do that but it's saying do you want me to attempt to transcribe it manually which yes do it manually let's see if we can do that so what it's going to have to do is play from the beginning listen to it I'm having so much fun so it wasn't able to do that but let's see if we can uh teach it how to get the transcription so we hit this button no we hit this button they they really hit it somewhere uh show transcript and that's the transcript so I taught it how to do that and let's see if we can click rerun with taught actions and we're going to hit go so now it's saying I'm clicking the show transcript button to access the transcript of the video all right so after doing that and went to the online notepad and said this is a simulated transcript the actual content would be transcribed here if it was possible all right I'm going to get a little bit nutty here let's do this cancel all my Amazon Auto recurring orders oh boy this might be a mistake uh let's see I'm I'm trusting you mulon Agent Zero you're my only hope so far it hasn't made any error in the sense that it didn't do anything it was not supposed to do if it can't do something it stops all right so I had to log into Amazon let's try it again so let's ask it to cancel all my auto recurring orders so it found the thing that I was subscribed to and it found how to cancel it so it's it's clicking cancel my subscription it it looks like it has to select reason for cancellation oh so it figured out that it has to select the reason for cancellation and it's going to select one from me I already have more that I need so just defaults to the to the first one which I think most people do so it's I'm clicking on the on that so yeah for some reason it feels like it's selected it but it can't like just finalize it and then click on confirm all right so I'm going to pause it okay at this point so it did select this and then it should have been able to click cancel my subscription all right so I got to say I I'm still very impressed with it here's why it navigated the entirety of Amazon it found all my items that were on auto replenish and figured out how to click cancel once it did that it tried clicking the cancel button that wouldn't work so it figured out that I have to select the correct you know whatever from the drop down menu saying I no longer need it and it did that it seemed like it select that option but it didn't like finalize it so it looks like you know how you hover over it it turns blue but you click on it and then it selects it it wasn't able to completely cancel that thing I don't think that's necessarily you know having to do anything with like the AI aspect of it in terms of decision making and figuring out what it's looking at I think that's more just making the plug-in the add-on play nice with the Chrome browser so I think that's more like dealing with the old school bugs and whatever instead of like figuring out how to have the AI properly na navigate the web so to me I'm almost like kind of dismissing that as just like hey the developers will figure that out they'll iron it out that might be fixed within the next few weeks also it does seem like that potentially some of these websites they do have prote against these add-ons how they interact with the websites so I've noticed a few times when I go in and I click on buttons the buttons won't work so and a couple times like it would just kick me out and force me to relog in so I think there's like some security issues also with you know cuz this thing is manipulating things automatically on the website so I'm sure a lot of them have some sort of protection against that just so you don't get some sort of a malicious virus or something like that that's just you know ordering stuff for you but also I felt like halfway through as it's doing it it got sidetracked and it added like a rug to my shopping cart yeah I'm clicking on the delete button to cancel the auto recurring order for the Safi VA natural fiber collection area rug I've never heard of that in my life I feel like it added it to Auto to the auto recurring order and then it took it out so I'm not sure what that is but again I can't help but feel very impressed with what's what what it's doing cuz a lot of this stuff just seems like little Tech things to get ironed out the AI decisionmaking its reasoning abilities seem spot-on so it doesn't run into issues where it can't understand how to do something it gets it it just sometimes it's like I got to click on this button that's the right button to click on it just it can't due to some glitch or security issue or whatever that that can be fixed that's that's almost like I feel like the easier easier thing to fix so guys say this is so far probably the best sort of automated agent of of this kind where it's a plugin that goes in and does stuff to websites it's pretty good and this is still beta this is still early access there's more and more people being added every day tons of people are trying it out they're still building it out and I got to say for something that's like day one this is their first sort of version that's available to the public their beta I got to say it does a lot of things really really well much better than most of the other stuff that I've tested like this there's still issues it's still runs into problems but it's able to reason pretty well it tries different stuff like refreshing the page Etc and it easily and naturally picks up things that I think are brand new for it so like the notepad. org or whatever that was the online notepad you know I just said post it in here and I gave it the website and it knew it just knew how to add the text to it like I didn't have to explain it I didn't have to teach it all right so just because it's a brand new website that's not going to stop it from interacting with it it's still going to figure it out it's really good at getting certain data from websites it's able to go to new sources and get that information extracted or just get the headlines it gets a little bit confused but if you're doing something like this and you're doing it to automate certain tasks you can probably write out specifically what you want step by step right because if you're trying to automate something that you should do a lot nothing stopping you from writing out a longer prompt that does exactly what you want it to do it's able to search for images and download them it's able to open up something like a photo and add images to it we we didn't quite get it to add that image to it but we came very very close and I got to say at this point this thing is so close to being perfect we are so close to having a functional autonomous AI agent I think now that this is opened up to the public that more and more people are testing it submitting their results teaching it how to do new stuff I think the weight list had 20,000 plus people on there so all those people once they're on it once they're helping to improve it once they're training it to do better I feel like this thing is going to get a lot better within the next few months I think it's going to get very very exciting if you want to try it out I say jump into Discord request. beta access start playing around with it it's not perfect but I think to me this is proof that 2024 we will have something like this that's fully functional reliable that's able to autonomously execute tons of stuff and this thing might be it if the development team keeps improving it and I think they will just looking at the documentation and all the stuff that they're thinking about all the stuff that they're working on I mean mean this this to me seems like this thing's going to be amazing I'm going to play around with it and we're going to do another video in the future really showcasing some of the more higher level things that it's going to be able to do I hope you enjoy that my name is Wes rth and talk to you next time and thank you for watching"
