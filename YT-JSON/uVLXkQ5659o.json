        "transcript": "alrighty I think I'm live so welcome to the live stream this is going to be a fun one I am going to do my underground AI live so if you've watched those last two underground AI videos what I did was basically on the Future tools website I get something like a 100 submissions a day on a slow day it's like maybe 50 submissions on a busy day it's 100 submissions and to this day I still click every single link that gets submitted and I go and test it myself and well I don't test every single one I open the web page and make sure it's something that looks interesting that hasn't been submitted 200 times already that does something kind of unique over all the other tools that are already on this site so I still click on every single link and at least look at it and in a lot of cases play around with the tools and you know outside of the open AI the mic Microsoft the anthropic uh Google all of those big companies you don't really hear about a lot of the smaller tools very often so I started this series underground AI where I pull anywhere from s to 10 tools that I find interesting that nobody else is talking about and I give them a go on recording but I figured it'd be really fun to do it live that way you know I am not necessarily cherry-picking any sort of outputs or things like that you guys can actually give me prom pums and say hey go and test that let's see here I'm just uh making sure everybody can hear me real quick all right cool it does say we're live so cool so that is the idea with this I'm going to go ahead and do another one of those underground AI episodes I'm just going to do it live so if a tool isn't working properly when I try to use it you're going to see that if a tool takes a really long time to process and give me back my response then you're going to see that as well this is all live we have no idea what's going to happen and uh I've picked I think seven or eight tools that I'm going to play around with and if this doesn't go too long you can even suggest some tools here inside of uh the chat and we can test some of those out as well all right I'm just going to peek at the comments real quick before we get going make sure there is no issues going on I've got three moderators helping me on this live stream in the last the last few live streams I've done um it was either just myself or only one moderator uh John who's here AKA crazy in the dark um but today we got crazy in the dark helping moderate we got AP helping moderate and then we have willow AKA let's see what was your username here on YouTube travel travel something Travel well sorry about that so we've got AP travel well and crazy in the dark here moderating so hopefully any sort of spam or Bots or just people being rude will get booted pretty quickly they're also keeping an eye on the comments for me so if uh if there's a chat comment that I need to see they're going to bring it to my attention so we're going to get into some tools play around with some stuff and then you know at the end do some Q&A test some tools that maybe you guys suggest on the stream and uh I'm done rambling I'm already three minutes into this thing let's just get into playing around with some tools here I'm going to go ahead and switch to my desktop now this live stream is actually a sponsored live stream uh M Studio a company called uai has a tool called Mind studio and they reached out and asked if they could sponsor one of the live streams and I said absolutely I've played with mind studio in the past I've made videos about mind studio in the past so I'm going to play around demo what mind Studio can do and that's going to be the first tool that we're going to talk about if mine studio is new to you well then this is an underground tool to you as well so let's just go ahead and get into it so mind Studio what this tool does is it builds these automated workflows using AI large language models and what's really cool about this is you can build this like visual workflow and like let me scroll down here so you can see the little animation you can build this little like drag and drop workflow and use multiple chatbots so if you wanted to you can have one step in this sequence use Claud and then the next step in the sequence use gp4 and then the next step in the sequence use llama 2 if you wanted to but it allows you to integrate with all sorts of different chat bots so I'm going to go ahead and log into my mind Studio account and we're going to build a workflow so I can give you an idea of one way that you can use it and then I'll show some other examples we'll spend a few minutes talking about mind studio and then move on to some other underground AI tools so the Mind Studio backend dashboard is pretty basic I'm going to click on this little plus up in the top left and we're going to create a brand new AI so I'll just go ahead and click create AI here and they've got all sorts of pre-built templates for these workflows already so things like an ad assistant a blog post generator internal job postings HTML banner ads telegram announcements all sorts of really cool pre-built templates but what I think is the coolest easiest way to build an AI automation inside of M studio is to let AI generate the initial prompt for you so I'm going to go ahead and click on generate prompt here and then click next down in the bottom and basically I'm going to describe what I want the AI to do so before I describe what I want the AI to do I want to give you a little bit of context so I've got a site that I've been working on over at news. futur tools. and essentially I built this website so that I can share news on my own domain so if you visit Future tools a lot you've probably seen this AI news page where I curate news from all over the web when I come across interesting AI news I make sure it is shared on this page P every once in a while I come across a news article that is maybe paywalled um and I pay for access to it but it's hard for other people to see it without paying or I come across a Discord announcement that is essentially news so I want to turn that Discord announcement into a News Post so I created my own news page so any news that's hard to share from a different resource or maybe I haven't seen a different resource share it yet I've got my own place to share it and then it'll make it on this list here that's why not every single piece of AI News is here it's just the stuff that I couldn't find a better place to share it so I just made my own post about it to share it so that's the context I want to give and the reason I'm giving that context is because in M Studio I want to create a bot that will essentially look at another another news article that already exists and then reword it for my news site while citing the source and sharing some key takeaways so basically I can copy and paste uh URL to a another news article and it will write it for my website that's one of the workflows that I'd like to try to build right now so in order to do that I'm going to start by telling the AI exactly what I want to do if you've used custom gpts inside of chat GPT this is kind of similar you're giving it that initial context that initial system prompt to run your AI workflow here so to describe the behavior of your AI here's how I'm going to explain it I want to find existing news articles share the URL to that article and then have that article Rewritten in a new voice along with key takeaways as well as citing its initial Source I know my grammar is horrible that's a huge run-on sentence under generation engine we really only have the one so you just going to leave that and we'll click generate and now basically what it's doing is it's writing the system prompt essentially for me it wrote this prompt for news article assistant uh the purpose of it is designed to locate existing news articles share the URL link to the article rewrite the article in a new voice provide key takeaways from the article always cite the initial source of the article so it's it got a little bit of it wrong here I don't want to locate existing news articles I will share the news articles so I'll just put uh let's see I will share the UR link URL link to the article and I'll just get rid of this first one so that it's clear so parameters the assistant must rewrite the article in a fresh unique Voice key takeaway should be concise and informative the an noal source of the article must be properly cited um and then it added some additional traits of the bot here so now we've got this system prompt the AI workflow bot whatever you want to call it knows what its purpose is it knows what its role is now now I'm going to move over to automations and you can see I've got this blank automation here it's got start and it's got chat I'm going to go ahead and delete the chat and now we're going to build out this workflow of everything we want it to do so I'm going to click on this little dot here and I'm going to start by adding a user input and this is where I'm going to essentially paste the URL of the article that I want to scrape and share a new version of so I will click on here over in the right we can see our user inputs I'll add a little plus here create a new user input and then under type we have a bunch of options long text short text text Choice image Choice Etc I want to scrape a URL um so we're going to call this uh variable original URL and then for label text we'll put original URL we can see our little example over here don't really need to do anything else here so now I can come back to my main workflow I can either click on this tab up here or click on it on the left and now we've got a user input with the original URL all right so now I want it to basically summarize that URL so what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to click Send a message but it's not going to send a message back to me what it's going to do is it's going to create a message as a variable so over here it says response behavior and under this I'm going to select assigned to variable instead of display the user if I did display the user it would basically act like chat GPT and just give a response back to me but I want it to actually save this scraped information here so the variable that I'm going to assign is let's call it revised article and then we can choose our model down here and you can see we have all of these models available and this is one of the really cool things about mine studio is that I can have each step in my workflow use a different model so if I want this first step to use CLA 3 Opus I can do that I want the second step to use Gemini Pro and then the third step to use gp4 turbo and do that all right so now under send a message I'm going to basically write a prompt like I would do for chat GPT so we've got our scraped input here if you remember we've got the variable is called Original URL so I'm going to copy this variable jump back back to our flow and then under message I'm just going to put these little brackets here and then paste in our variable that says original URL here and this is going to basically be the scraped content so original URL is going to be the sum of all the scraped content that it did in this first step so I'm going to put here's the original article and then I'm going to give it a prompt here's the original article and then we've got the original article essentially pasted in there and then the prompt we're going to give it is rewrite this article in a new voice use Simple language keep it around 500 words I don't want it to be crazy long articles I just wanted to kind of quickly summarize the main point of the article it's going to name it revised article I'll show you what we're going to do with that in a second and then under model lately I've been using Cloud 3 Opus I think it's the best one there is and then for Max token response I'm just going to Max it out here and now we've got that step so if you're following along you're going to input a URL it's going to scrape that URL it is then going to rewrite the article in a new voice using simple language and this Rewritten article it's going to save in a variable called revised article I'm going to go ahead and copy our variable name because now I want it to give me a bulleted list of key takeaways so I'm going to send the message here I'm going to put new article and then in these little brackets here I'm going to put our revised article and then for my prompt I'm going to say give me between 3 to five bullet points of the key takeaways from this article make them brief and to the point and once again instead of display to user I'm going to assign it as a variable we'll call this one uh key takeaways and then if I wanted I could change the model but I like Opus again so I'm going to go ahead and just use Opus for each of these steps max out the response tokens here so now scrapes the URL rewrites it saves the Rewritten version as a variable reads the revised version and then writes three to five bullet points and oh sorry I moved my face so hopefully you can see it now um so there you go so you can see over on the right here I'm assigning the revised article to this key takeaways here I'm going to use use cloud 3 Opus and then uh let's see here so now we've got our revised article our key takeaways now I want it to do one last step I wanted to generate a title for this news article so I'm going to do one more send a message here um and this time I'm going to grab the original art actually no the revised article I want to grab that I'm getting myself confused here all right I want to grab the revised article here so I'll copy that variable um and then I'll do here is the revised article actually I need to put it in these little brackets here there's the revised article please generate a simple to the point title for this article that includes the main point all right uh once again assign a variable we'll call this simply title and then model I'm going to use Opus and now the final step is we can have it display everything it did back to us so I'm going to go ahead and add another send a message here this time it is going to display to the user and the sender is going to be the system and in this message I'm going to have it send us the title so I'm going to use a little bit of markdown here if I put these two little hashtags here and then put title it will use the markdown language for the title so I'll put that our variable for title is just called title so I'm going to put our little brackets do title then I want to do key takeaway so I'll put some mark down here key takeaways our variable for that is just key takeaways I'll add that there and then we've got our revised article which I can just copy this here go to send message and put revised article paste that so now if you're following along to the workflow put a URL in here it's going to scrape the URL it's going to rewrite that same article as a new article it's going to make bullet points with key takeaways it's going to then pick a title for it and then it's going to send me a message back with title key takeaways and revised article all in this one workflow all I have to do now is find an article to test it with so in order to do that let me just go to uh feedle here see if there's a a news article I can share uh let's just do this one here Microsoft to invests 2.9 billion in AI Cloud infrastructure in Japan I could grab this URL here and we'll use this as our test article let's publish this one and then I'll open the published app and you can see now here's our published app that we just created uh original URL I'm going to paste in this news article that we just grabbed and I'm going to click next and I'm crossing my fingers that I did everything right because now it should scrape the article write a new version give me some key takeaways give me a title and then display it all on the screen for me all at once that was the end goal that I was trying to accomplish here and uh hopefully that's what I get and while this is happening I'm just kind of taking a peak over at the comments here can you feed in multiple URL and aggregate the URL you have to do it one at a time you can't you know list like a whole bunch of URLs um there may be a workflow that you can set up and get creative with that will let you do that but right now it's one URL at a time and let's see what else do you got uh somebody's saying is scraping considered fair use basically if you think of like like the news right one website will report on the news and then pretty much every other news website out there will then also report on the same news I'm kind of doing the same thing I'm citing my source you can even see here's what it created for me uh the title Microsoft invest 2.9 billion in Japan's AI future boosting skills and infrastructure you can see it's not the same title a brand new title that it just created here's the key takeaways Microsoft is investing 2.9 billion in Japan investment focuses on enhancing cloud computing uh Microsoft is collaborating with Japan's cabinet Secretariat Etc and then it shares this Source here and then it actually duplicated the key takeaways I'm not quite sure why it did that um but then we have the revised article down here and this is a completely brand new version of the article that it just wrote for me so I can literally copy this article copy the key takeaways and then grab the title that it generated jump over to my WordPress blog here and create a brand new article for it all these images if you can't have all either been generated in dolly or mid Journey as well so even more AI to kind of keep this AI News website up to date very very meta I know so that was my uh AI voice refiner now there are other cool things that you can do inside of mine studio uh I actually was playing around with this one called meeting Insight summarizer let me click into this workflow real quick and just show it off to you this one is designed or if you have a zoom meeting you can actually download the transcripts from the zoom meeting upload them into this tool here and then it will actually send the takeaways that you need to know from that Zoom meeting over into slack for you so if we look at the automation here uh user input it's asking for the transcript from the meeting so you upload a file here um and then it sends a message to generate the meeting summary from a transcript and then what it does is from that it takes that summary that it generates sends it over to zaper through a web hook and then this zapier web hook actually sends it off to slack for you so the message shows up in slack and then it also sends the user a message on the frontend user interface to show you what message was also just sent to slack so that's a really cool workflow um if you're not familiar with zap beer it's really easy to create you come in here you click create a new Zap for your trigger you would essenti just set up your trigger as a web hook and catch a hook and then we skip the this step and then under our and then it gives us this URL here so we'd copy this URL and then you can see under our zapier web hook we would plug that URL in right here and then this is the response that we got from this last step in the automation it's passing that into zapier and then under action you can have the action send it to wherever you want send it to a Google sheet an Evernote slack anywhere zapier will send a message it can pass that message over so pretty pretty cool stuff I really really dig mine studio for creating these workflows and automations one other thing that uh uh M Studio showed off to me was this new profiler feature this is really cool because it allows you to essentially test different large language models against each other uh so if I wanted to here you can see I've got gpt3 turbo but I can change this to Claud Opus then over here I can change this one to uh gp4 turbo and I can add a third profile if I want and let's say this one we want um let's do Gemini Pro as this third one here and then let's see done done done and then if I give it a message here like write me a poem about Ai and YouTube and hit enter you'll see that Opus gp4 turbo and Gemini Pro will all respond to that prompt we can see which one's faster we can see which one generates our a better response so just another kind of cool interesting feature inside of mine studio if you want to kind of compare different large language models against each other and actually see them play out in real time so that is mine Studio again I want to thank mine studio for sponsoring this live stream I did put a link down in the description it I believe there's a coupon code on there I think it's friends 100 gets you your first month free if you want to jump into M studio and play around with it so thank you so much to M studio for for sponsoring this and uh letting me play around with the tool they did provide me with $50 in credits to play around with show it off share it for you and uh you can put create some pretty cool workflows I mean I'm kind of thinking of Fairly linear workflows here but there's some really interesting like outside the box workflows that you could probably think of uh especially when you start connecting it up with sappier and things like that all right so that's mine Studio I've got about seven or eight other tools I want to play around with but really quickly before I do let me just kind of check in with the chat over here make sure there's nothing I'm meeting uh I'm missing here all right fix the face cam issue thanks John for pointing that out um couple comments asking blocking settings in the bottom right yep my studio says I believe you set Opus to Temp one that's too high for cloud 3 Opus it should be 0.2 to 0.4 for this okay so cool somebody in mine studio is actually in the comments helping me there we go um so let me get back into how do I get out of my work oh it's up here um so yeah what he's saying is under the temperature I should set it at 2 to 0.4 so you can set your temperature there 2.4 and then let's see if I publish that I would go ahead and do that with all of my Opus Integrations here so that would be the proper way to set up Opus make sure your temperature is set to 0.2 to 0.4 and that is straight from the team at mind Studio who's hanging out in the chat with us right now uh mind studio also says it's one month free for the Pro Plan there are usage fees associated with the workflow uh but you get $5 in usage as well so thank you again to M Studio let's see here what else should I show off in M Studio before playing around with some other tools kind of clicking around seeing if there's anything that I forgot to talk about that I wanted to talk about here you may have watched my old video where I played around and made a Mr beastbot so you can check that video out um as well where I deep dive into M Studio cool well thank you for uh thank you again to mine studio for sponsoring it thanks to mine studio for hanging out on this live stream and actually providing some additional help and conext and tips for people um so really really appreciate that and you'll definitely be hearing more about M Studio from me I play with it a lot and I will be showing off more workflows in the future in future videos as well alrighty let me close out of some stuff here and I just realized I wasn't showing my screen again I'm really bad at doing that on live streams where I start talking about something and I forget that I'm not sharing my screen um and thank you to Jungle Inc crypto for the donation I really appreciate that all right I'm going to leave it on my screen for a little while instead of going to my face cam because I have a tendency of not switching it back properly so the next tool that I want to talk about on underground AI is one that I personally haven't heard of very much of but I was talking to Kip Bodner who is the CMO of uh HubSpot and he asked me if I've played around with this tool and I said well I've heard of it I've listed it on Future tools but I've never actually clicked into it and played around with it yet and that tool is called recraft AI so let me pull recraft AI up again this is one I haven't really played with but it's definitely popular because it's got 400,000 plus users and over 50 million AI generated uh Graphics so a lot of people know about it it's just one I haven't really played with yet so I want to jump in test this one out and see how it does I'm going to go ahead and log in here I'm G to actually pull it off my screen real quick while I log in once I'm logged in I will pull it back right all right so going through onboarding I use it personal what do you plan to create um all of it I don't know um vector image vectorization yes all of the above have you ever used AI design tools before I'll go ahead and say Yes quite often how did you hear about recraft I heard it from a podcast I was on the marketing Against the Grain podcast when Kip Bodner shared it with me all right so we've got a little tutorial describe what you expect to see generate and browse all right let's recraft by Cloud says does Matt play fortnite I have played fortnite my kids play fortnite more than I do though I will not be playing fortnite on this stream I'm curious have you guys played with recraft before uh let me know in the comments if you have used recraft also if you have any prompts you want me to test feel free to type them in and we will test those prompts um so one of the things about recraft and the thing that uh Kip brought it up to me for was recraft will actually generate vectors so it'll create Vector illustrations which if you're not familiar with vectors you typically open them in a tool like like Adobe Illustrator but it makes the image like infinitely scalable so if you're trying to blow something up and put it on a giant sign a vector is what you're going to want because you can scale it to whatever size you need to a lot of people haven't used uh recraft yet so cool all right so we've got some different styles over here we've got some Vector options I'm really interested in the vectors because vectors are great for Loos and again things like Signs and blowing stuff up really big so I'm going to go ahead and do a let's just do a vector art to start here and I'm going to do my go-to a wolf howling at the moon not sming at your mom let's see modify current image let's just go ahead and click recraft oh let's look at our settings here level of detail we've got primitive all the way up to extreme let's kind of put it Midway then we've got some negative prompts that we can add here let's go ahead and click recraft and that should generate a vector for us here let's see what are you guys saying here I do the channel to keep the Basilisk away uh Vector AI are not good enough uh let's see pickle Rick and a Superman costume with Super Saiyan hair I don't know if I said that word right well there's my wolf howling at the moon that's pretty good actually let's see okay so this generated two versions and this almost feels like a figma board and so far I haven't paid for anything this is I don't know if it's a free trial or if this tool is just free to use we'll we'll explore that here in a second but I could scale this up and notice because it's a vector it maintains its quality as I scale it up that's pretty cool all right so I want to try this other prompt that was just given mostly because Rick and Morty is you know it's trademark and I wanted to know if uh it's going to actually pull in pickle Rick let's go ahead and do cartoon see if that makes a difference here and let's do recraft if it actually knows what pickle Rick is I will be kind of surprised let's see Brian Mooney says a pug dressed as a doctor okay okay I'll try that one next let's see AP says does Chat [Music] thing actually that's better than I thought it would be I don't think it got the Rick and Morty pickle Rick reference but it got a sort of humanized humanoid pickle with a Superman costume and then I don't think it quite got the hair right but here's the other variation actually better than I was expecting um the S is a little bit better on this one than this one all right so what was the Pug prompt here a pug Dro dressed as a doctor I'll go ahead and plug this in here then I don't know what style to do um let's do Vector Kawaii try that let's see somebody wants me to generate a burger pickle Rick it's pickle Rick uh let's see okay there's your pug dressed as a doctor a little cartoony let's see if we do a different style here maybe a non vector or do they all are they all vectors not quite sure let's try psychedelic let's try a psychedelic pug dressed as a doctor it's not pickle Rick it's Larry from Veggie Tales yeah that's probably closer actually all righty so let's see a person meditating in the jungle we'll try that all right so this one is the doctor pug here a really really fancy Dr pug but yeah it's um don't believe this one's a vector let me see paste it in here doesn't tell me the file export oh I can export as a PNG or JPEG but it's not a vector all right let's take a look at this um I want to oh wait there was one more I'm going to try here person meditating over a jungle all right that's the last one I'm going to try and then I'm going to look into it a little bit more figure out price all that kind of stuff I'm going to do Vector again because I really think the vector is where this one shines if we're making a JPEG or PNG I mean everything else does that really well also not many of these tools do a really good job at vectors let's go ahead and do a person meditating over a jungle and let's do it in a flat 2.0 style see what that generates it's really interesting because it does just kind of create this giant big muff feeling board where I can just add more images I kept on recrating the same image and then I realized I can just create more images next to it instead of recrating the same image so uh yeah there's a slight learning curve but not too bad let's see not a s you can click and make it a vector somebody said oh vectorize yeah so even if you do generate as a JPEG or PNG you can turn it into a vector so thanks for pointing that out mindful mini pods all right so AP let's see somebody is asking will it actually make vector graphics or just a vector looking graphic will it scale so this one supposedly is a vector so export as Yeah we actually get Vector we can actually download it as an SVG file if we want this one it made it as a JPEG or PNG but we can actually click vectorize and convert it into a vector let's see so I don't know how long it takes but it's working on making this one a vector so let's just I'll just wait for that for a second it does people well in photo realism like Donald Trump or Biden and it actually does it instead of saying no well that's good to know all right so just turn this into a vector and now I can export it as a vector file very cool all right I got to try one more image uh now I got to try like um Trump or Biden just because it was suggested and it said it was really good with people so photo realism how do I get to photo realism photo realism all right so we'll select that and let's just do um Joe Biden on stage with an American flag sure I want to see its realism and then we'll actually dive in and look at some of the other stuff about this tool yeah I mean that's not bad it's um not the best Joe Biden I've ever seen but it's not horrible I mean it's okay it's okay I I I feel like mid Journey might still do a better job with it but yeah not too bad all right now I really want to sort of dig in a little bit here all right La last one last one um John is telling me to do Joe Biden and Donald Trump hugging let's see what we get all right that's it that that really is the last one that is the last one you know what you know what I don't know what's going going on with Biden's face there and he's also got an extra finger but that's pretty common with these AI image generators still that one is actually not bad that one you know you can tell who those are supposed to be all right all right okay so let's look at the subscription real quick here I'm just curious so for free you can get commercial license but the images are public for 20 bucks a month commercial license images are private and will not appear in the community Gallery you get faster image generation and a limited time offer or that's if you pay yearly or if you pay monthly it's 25 bucks a month so it looks like there's no real limits and they're available for commercial use so pretty pretty pretty cool um all right so let me just look at my notes Here make sure I covered everything I want to cover covered how much it costs um I think so far what the value in this tool is is really for making the vectors both in generating a vector straight up or actually vectorizing a non vector image so that seems to be the best use case for this if you're looking for realism I feel like mid journey is probably still a little bit better at realism um but this one's this one's really really good at the vector stuff so just turned that into a vector for me so if you guys want to see you know Trump and Biden much larger on the screen there you go I know you all wanted that yeah that one's pretty cool especially since you can create vectors seemingly completely for free I'm not sure if there's any limits I don't see any sort of credit system or anything like that uh I like this sort of figma board style this giant I guess like infinite whiteboard where you can just keep on generating images that's really really cool so give this tool a thumbs up I like it let's see what do we got here all right so I'm going to move on to the next tool here otherwise I can definitely spend 30 minutes on every tool and we'll be going till the middle of the night so I'm going to move on to the next one that I wanted to play around with and this one's actually open source uh this one was by request on Twitter somebody asked if there was a a opsource tool that will take a still image of a person and make the lips move so there is this tool did I've played around with it in past videos if you've been around the AI space for a little bit you've probably already seen it it's a tool where you can upload a you know a single 2D image and it will actually make the mouth move to an audio so you can type in some text give it a aign a voice to it and that person will speak in that voice Voice or you can upload an audio file and it will sync up the voice to the audio file that you gave it and somebody was saying hey is there a free open source alternative to did and there is it's called sad talker and you can actually install this locally on your computer run it on your own GPU if you want but I did find a hugging face space that also does this so this is kind of the same idea as did I feel like did does it a little bit better there's a little bit more Motion in the head and a little bit more blinking it feels a little bit better but this essentially does the same thing there's a handful of examples down here um this one's my favorite because uh this is the face they gave but this is the audio input the holidays are a time of celebrating with loved ones enjoying the festivities and muddling through Wisconsin's cold and so when you put the two together you get this video the holidays are a time of celebrating with loved ones enjoying the festivities and muddling through Wisconsin's cold but for many this year has been and so it the voice in the face don't really match up that well but you get the idea of what it can do uh there's some other examples here let's try this one here's the input audio homeage and then this is the image they gave and then this is the output so if I wanted I can actually remove this image let me see if I have an image on my hard drive somewhere that I can just toss in here real quick what do I got what do I got I won't use that one I was going to use an image of someone else but I don't know if they would appreciate it uh so let me go to my images here head shot I'll go ahead and use I'll use this image which is like my profile picture for everything and I'll just use this same audio actually you know what can I do a type where do I type thought this one had an option to type in some text and it will actually do the text but I'm not seeing it here so maybe I do have to just select some existing reference audio I'm just going to pick some existing audio just to keep it quick and replace it with my head here and then I'll click generate and it's too busy right now keep trying all right so there you go that's yeah it won't generate right now because the hugging face space is too busy I could duplicate the space but if you've ever duplicated a space on hugging face sometimes it takes a good five minutes just to get the space duplicated it's kind of a bummer it's too busy of course the moment I'm doing a live stream this one's too busy for me to use but I guess you know the idea was to show you what it does and if you know what did does uh which is short for D identification by the way in case you're wondering why they call it did um then oh wait hold on hold on let's see what is AP saying over here all right so he's telling me about one called Annie portrait official which is actually he says more state-ofthe-art than even sad talker all right so this is definitely the first time I've seen this one his AP is pointing it out to me right now in the inside of the Discord I've got a little Discord going with the other moderators here here I'll type it in it's D- Doom for anybody that's looking for the one that I was talking about so let's look at some of the examples here pull up this one so here's the reference audio here's the reference image let's go ahead and generate it's going to take about 28 seconds here what we get let's see please make videos favorite AI tools learnx AI Romo AI cool just kind of keeping an eye on the comments All right so here's what it generated it's only one second why it only one second did I skip a step Here length I got to crank the length here try this again and I should probably turn off my slack notifications while I'm on a live stream all right so now we're trying to generate hopefully I can get it to generate a little bit longer of a video and then next I'll try uploading my face what we get then I'll move on to the next tool that I had on the list after this one anytime now so the next one oh there we go is going to be so this now it generated three seconds so if you're looking for a way to take a 2D image and add audio over it probably the simplest way to do it if you're willing to pay or try the free trial is this did.com it does exactly what I'm doing but it's faster and you're using their servers uh but there's some there are open source Alternatives you can install these locally if you want you've got sad talker and you've got any portrait official again if you want to use sad talker and it's loading really slow just duplicate the space it might cost you like 25 cents or something to use it but uh you can do it that way yeah it's still busy right now so there's some alternatives to did if you want to make that 2D talk animation all right so the next one I wanted to talk about somebody you know sunno has been all the rage lately it makes really really good AI music you plug in a prompt and then it turns that prompt into a song with lyrics background music everything right well somebody told me we should check out sonado doai basically claiming that it was sort of a competitor to sunno and that uh it makes really really good songs from what I can tell it doesn't actually do lyrics though it just makes Beats so I'm curious if anybody here has played around with son. a um because if you have share any tips you have with me inside of the comments as we test it out here uh but let's go ahead and select popular and listen to you know one of the popular songs that it generated let's do top of all time though Change the World featuring AI Katy Perry so okay maybe it does do vocals let's see oh it does have [Music] vocals hey we had our doubts but now we're stronger and that's okay hey let's tell the world that we're in this together and I know that brighter days are on their way I know I know it FS your heart [Music] moving not bad at all I stop it though oh okay um I didn't know that this did actual lyrics [Music] um yeah somebody said no lyrics this one it it did play the lyrics on this one it says featuring AI KD Perry so let's see conquer us all let's see if this one has lyrics it does I was just completely wrong about [Music] this [Music] shwn where Liv now the interesting all right let's go ahead and try to make a song here I'm just going to call this a song I mean I wouldn't say that this is better than whatso 3.0 generates um but it's pretty good let's see describe your song in a few words I always go to the same stuff it makes it easier to compare right so I like to go early 2000s pop HK anthem um let's just do it they actually put like an actual artist name let's do a Blink 182 song about Ai and YouTube see what does that do so we have some custom options here write a minute and a half of lyrics Rhythm control strength Rhythm assist all right I'm going to turn I don't really care about all this advanced stuff let's just see what it does if we just generate something right out of the box see here it's comparable to sunno in quality miles feels like dancing Sweet let's see uh let's see what it it says it's waiting for an available GPU so I have no idea how long this is actually going to take and let's see what do we got so AI Andy is here what's up AI Andy good to see you AI Andy's also got a YouTube channel and is on the Twitter's and X's definitely a good follow in the AI space so it seems like from the comments people have uh very mixed reviews of the songs uh some say awful some say not bad um all right this song features energetic electric guitars and fast-paced drumming characteristic of blink 182's pop rock style Mark Hoppus and Matt ska's vocals Matt skeba is not in the Band anymore but cool let's see what it sounds oh did it generate three [Music] [Applause] variations [Music] [Applause] we found our streaming online C the web we intertwine artificial mind start toise stage I mean it's not horrible there's a little bit of like distortion on the voice that sounds kind of unnatural that I don't feel like I get as much with sunno sunno the lyrics sound a little bit cleaner I would say instrumentally they're pretty com comparable but the lyrics I feel like sunno still does it a little bit better it did sound like the voice though the voice was fairly close it just sounded like electronic like it was overly processed or has distortion on it or something like that but yeah I do think sunno is better there's a new one that uh that people are starting to talk about as well uh called o stud but nobody has access to it yet there's been a few little like uh leaks on Twitter where people have made songs with this udio tool and the people that have played with it have said that it's better thano 3 but I don't have access yet so that'll probably be on a future video where we actually play around with that one and then I'm actually curious there any sort of like pricing or information so I guess it's just free I don't see any options to pay I don't see there there's nothing here that makes me think that we have to pay so I guess it's just open for anybody to use so you can find this one over at son. Sona oo I think it's sonado but I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right or not all righty so no logic David is here what's up good to see you good to see you um all right so I'm going to jump over to the next tool that I had in mind and this one is like one of the OG video tools and uh one of our moderators on this call AP is actually on the team who makes this tool and he told me that if we talk about this tool today they'll hook people up on this call with a discount so everybody obviously Sora uh the Sora video came out everybody saw it and went holy crap aiv video is going crazy we've seen all the videos from you know animate diff which essentially looks like uh kind of like an existing video and then somebody put like a cartoon skin over it kind of thing that's sort of what you tend to see with that style of video The Forum makes these like crazy cool psychedelic like spinny artsy videos so if you haven't played with the Forum yet you got to play with it it's honestly it's like the OG uh original AI video thing long before Sora long before people were playing with animate diff um long before Pika and Runway we were playing with deform in fact if you go back on this channel like a year ago me and human who are actually who's actually here in the chat right now as well did a live stream where we did a deep dive into how to use deorum well now they've made deorum Studio which is a frontend user interface that just makes it so much easier to generate videos with deorum so with the Forum uh we we'll take a quick look at the pricing first so for eight bucks you get 20 credits and I believe there was some sort of coupon code that AP was sharing where if you want to get uh a a discount AP can go ahead and share it in the in the chat if if you want to share that I am drawing a blank on what it is right now but let's go ahead and create an animation I'll click on animate and then we can do a prompt let's do a wolf howling at the moon let's do psychelic I don't know how to I never know how to spell that word psychedelic colorful um beautiful art I'm just going to stuff a bunch of stuff in there prompt style we've got a whole bunch of options for prompt style here let's do I want to do like a crazy psychedelic one do yeah we got psychedelic as an option so perfect motion preset you've got all sorts of options like zoom in zoom out evolve all sorts of stuff but I'm just going to do random and see what it generates and for aspect ratio let's do [Music] 169 and I'm going to go ahead and click animate and see what it gives us so AP is saying the promo code is Future tools Future tools all one word and uh gets you three bucks off the 20 credit pack so if you want to check this out for only five bucks for 20 credits use the code Future tools I had planned on talking about this tool Anyway by the way this I'm not talking about it just because AP and human are on this call I think AP and human are on this call because they knew I was going to end up talking about it uh but I do appreciate them creating a coupon they did that like last minute right before we jumped on the live stream they're like oh you're going to talk about us here's a coupon code you can shout out so I really really appreciate them for doing that uh but I've been using theorum for a while in fact let's see if you go to my YouTube account and you go to the live streams the very first live stream I ever did was a year ago and this was me and human and somebody from run diffusion all showing off how to use Deora and it's 2 hours and 38 minutes of pure deorum so if you like what deorum does you can go check out that live stream as well and get a super deep dive on what this is capable of oh look at that so it's still processing here but I'm already liking what this is looking like this is really awesome for like music videos and things like this um in fact let me I'm not going to actually play this song Because YouTube will cut any sort of monetization but um Lincoln Park actually put out a music video recently and most of the video was generated with deorum so this lost video here is mostly using deorum to create this is it going to play the audio okay don't play the audio there we go so you can see if you watch through this video a lot of what you're seeing in these animations is using this deorum style animation oh so here's the video that I just generated where we've got this psychedelic colorful wolf that starts off howling at the moon like can't you see that being used in the background of a music video I mean it obviously it reminds me of like this Lincoln Park video that you're seeing here but this one's you know slightly more psychedelic so AP human is there anything else that I should point out about deorum you guys are the pros you're the experts you're the guys that are working on it so I want to make sure if there's some really really cool feature about this that I need to show off let me know so I can actually do it but like this makes really I mean it's obviously not going for realism right you're not going to get that Sora guy walking on the moon like with a spaceship in the background it all looks realistic or you know the woman looking out the subway and you can see the reflections on the glass that's not what deform is going to generate it's going to generate these sort of images that all sort of mold and merge into each other to create this crazy trippy video here all right so so AP is saying we got to check out the explore page so let's click on explore here and all right these are I guess all of the generations that have been getting generated by other people recently so we can actually filter it down to just like the style so if I just want to see uh psychedelic videos I can filter down to just psychedelic videos and see what other people have generated that fall under that kind of psychedelic category so if there's a certain style you're looking for you can come to the explore page click on style here under filters let's look at all the ones that are 3D model style you can see what this style kind of oh that one's really cool I like that Dragon there let's see what's the other filter so motion preset let me set that to all and then you can see what these different motion presets look like too like what space walk The Space Walk is like it looks like it kind of tilts back and forth as it zooms in I guess that's what uh The Space Walk motion preset does let's see are there any other presets that I should check out any other filters that would look that we should uh all right so Taz says psychedelia is easy let's see something more stable all right give me a prompt uh shoot me over a prompt you'd like to see me do and we'll do it uh someone wants to see the slow motion tick enabled this one's still processing up so the video is getting longer and longer every time I look at it I just love the colors in it like the colors are kind of badass [Music] so let's go ahead and use the same prompt but let's do slow motion this time and then the prompt style I'll do photographic and then I'll leave this on random and then I'll set this as slow motion and let's go ahead and animate that let's see what other what other suggestions here uh is there an API for deorum zobot is asking well I believe deorum is available as open source um but human would be the one to answer that so human if you can jump in let them know somebody's asking about an API you'd be the one to know well you an AP let's see high fresnel porcelain I'm just kind of trying to copy and paste some prompts over here to test oh so hi fral porcelain wolf okay okay let's see here to see can I generate two at the same time will it actually like a what style should I go for this one there like a porcelain style what's do do hyper realism on this one and then mocean preset there classic stop motion human was suggesting trying the stop motion don't know if I should try one or two let's do two because two sounds newer we'll animate that one but here's our wolf howling at the moon using the photographic style and slow motion you can see it sort of evolves in sort of more slow motion now human says they're going to be rolling out the API this week so there you go if you want to use the API for this you'll probably have it soon and then all right so it's generating our stop motion here so we'll see how that looks and then after a couple of these I will move on to the next tool but just a reminder if you use the coupon code Future tools the guys over at deorum are going to give you 20 credits for three bucks off oh try an image prompt okay good call good call I will do an image prompt and then that will be the last test on this one I do like the slow-mo the slow-mo looks uh cool not very photographic that's true um I mean it's using basically I believe it's using stable diffusion images so I mean it'll it'll be as photographic as you can get it probably as photographic as stable diffusion will get but then of course the images are all sort of merging and sort of blending together so I mean how realistic are you actually going to get with that being the case Brian Mooney your default prompt wolf howling at the moon Matt vid Pro is a lemon thing um and then Brian's is a pug dressed up as a doctor I mean it's good to kind of pick a prompt that you use every time you're testing a new tool that way you have some sort of Benchmark to test again so that's what I do here all right so is this one I Fresno porcelain wolf howling at the moon hyper realism classic stop motion it's still proc I I like the fact that you can actually start to watch the video while it's actually processing too like the video is going to get longer and longer and longer you can see it's processing but it's actually showing us like where the video is at right now that's actually looking pretty cool too all right so the last one I want to try is I want to try an image prompt so I'll flip the image prompt on here and then let's see I will pull in I'll just pull in my profile pick here start with that one and then for prompt a white man with a black beard turning into a pirate let's see what it does prompt style let's do neon Punk cuz it's kind of got that look to it already motion preset um I don't know I really like just leaving it on random because it does really cool stuff all right so image influence you've got a slider here so you can make it more influenced by the text or more influenced by the image um let's leave it in the middle and just kind of see what we get I'm going to leave it at 15 seconds just so it doesn't take as long to generate and let's see what we get here I'll animate this one so our wolf howling at the moon our photographic one almost unprocess but you can see how cool that one's gotten and then here's our high Fresno porcelain wolf fing at the Moon hyper realism with classic stop motion and we're still waiting on this one then let me see what what do we what do we got over here in the comments David says with recraft he takes it back it is a real Vector he just tried it and it works needs a little tweaking but it's definitely usable very cool um people are talking about not safe for work stuff for the most part you're not going to be able to do much not safe for work stuff on most of these um you know SAS SAS platforms like the software of service most of them don't like you doing not safe for work but if you uh install stuff locally on your own computer like if you run your own um large language model using a tool like uh LM Studio or Jan you can do not safer work with your large language models if you're doing AI art you can use stable diffusion generate whatever you want uh one of the online platforms that does still let you make whatever you want completely uncensored is Leonardo um Leonardo actually does use stable diffusion under underneath the hood but they have their own sort of uh fine-tuned models and their own workflows under the hood to make it work but they still doow allow not save for work if that's what you're into what is high Fresno that's a good question I don't know I just copied and pasted it and I didn't want to sound like an idiot saying I don't know what that word means um but let me look it up uh distance between the [Music] screen res equation in honestly I don't know I just uh I copied it and pasted it from the chat so um yeah I don't know the person who suggested that prompt might be able to give a better explanation Scanner Darkly Vibes yeah for sure not uh not safe for work wolf I don't know what that would look like all right so ooh that's uh that was a creepy pose to land on here let me move my head to this side here I'm already creeped out I think it turned my uh my little shoulder badge things into earrings nice it starts with this image and then you can see it just kind of like morphs different images eventually I guess I'll probably look like a pirate that's probably why it started to do like the tattoos and the earrings and stuff because apparently that's what Pirates have obviously and then um yeah that's true I cannot make not safe for work stuff on Stream So if you're asking me to generate not safe for work stuff I'm not going to do it I'll tell you where you can generate it go to Leonardo or install stable diffusion on your own computer they'll let you do it all day long but no not going to do it on a live stream um all right so my animations they're telling me to peek in there as well so you can see all the stuff that I generated you can see the first time I used it guess what I generated so that is deorum Studio makes these really cool you know psychedelic animations thank you so much to the deorum crew human and AP they are again hanging on this call they if you use the code Future tools you get $3 off the $20 pack if you want to play around with this but I love deorum I use it all the time if you've watched my past videos where I uh made like music videos and stuff they pretty much always included theorum videos in there as well Al righty I'm a little behind schedule I have three other tools I wanted to talk about uh two of them should be pretty quick though um this next one is not one of the quicker ones though this is just one that I recently came across in fact I think AP was the one who told me to check this one out as well it is called vigle doai so vigle AI is a tool where you basically upload a image and then a video of someone doing some sort of motion and then it will actually make that character right so here's if you're looking at this little video that is showing on the screen right now you can see that uh we've got a initial image that they uploaded then they uploaded a Tik Tock dancer someone dancing and it applied the dance moves from this video to this character and then you can see that's what that final animation looked like so pretty cool I have not actually tried this myself yet so um I'm trying this for the first time on the stream and hopefully it doesn't completely screw up but um this one is one that you have to do in Discord so the people that I'm talking to in Discord right now that are helping me moderate I won't see your messages for a second because I'm going to pull up vigle over here on Discord uh so this is the vigle Discord and one of the things that I've been having fun doing is literally just scrolling through some of the other animations people have done cuz some of them are pretty dang cool um some of them are also really hilarious uh let me see if I could find like a really good one oh you can give it a text prompt too I forgot to mention that you can upload a single image give it a text prompt and it will make a video based on the text prompt as well so you can see this one that I'm looking at on the screen right now the prompt was break dancing and then they uploaded this image and it turned it into this guy break dancing here um here's one that the prompt was dollar sign bobin they uploaded this image of like a pigeon with a gold chain and this is what it made so that's the type of thing vigle does now practical use cases I guess if you're making like some uh if you're making a game and you want like an NPC that's dancing or something you've got that if you're making a video and you want to have some animated characters moving around doing dances in the videos this seems like it'd be really fun for Content creation to make some animated characters um but I haven't tested it so I actually need to learn how to do it real quick uh let's see channel guide no that'ss epic qes I'm not quite sure how to prompt it yet um maybe if I just come here and type A well create a video all right cool so I type slash we can see we've got animate image motion prompt background fine tune let's go ahead and do that so for animation let's upload an image see what do I got here all right so here's an image of me it's like a full body shot it's like one of the few full body shots I have on my computer so I use that as the image um for the motion prompt let's do uh disco dancing and then uh fine tune I'll put that as on I don't know if I need it on or not let's go ahead and just generate that all right so background it's asking which one I want to do let's just do a weight background all right now I should be able to prompt it and rroll all the way down and there we go so I'm currently in Q I have no idea how long this takes it does sound like a handful of people here have used vigle before um so yeah somebody's asking for the link if you just go to vigle doai and then click on join the beta that'll open up the Discord so that's the way to get to the Discord wiggle. click join the beta it'll throw you right in there let's see oh a twitch emote yeah that can work for a twitch emote as well uh what else do we got what else do we got while I'm waiting for it to generate I'm just kind of reading the comments here is it using animate anyone under the hood I'm actually not sure there's not a ton of documentation from what I can tell and quite honestly even if they were they probably wouldn't tell us so let's see what else what else what else so we're at a time where we have a thousand or so AI tools how soon till we have an AI that can just do insert prompt here probably pretty soon I really think we're going to have an AI to tool that's connected to all the other AI tools like in the same way you use chat GPT right now and you have um doly just built into chat GPT you tell it make me an image of this thing it'll go make you that image using Dolly I think eventually we'll probably have some sort of chat large language model user interface that knows about all the various tools that are available you enter a prompt and it goes and uses the proper tool that was kind of the initial intention with chat GPT they originally rolled out plugins to do that kind of thing then they rolled back plugins and then they did GP custom gpts which now can kind of do that sort of thing with apis and that's where a lot of these companies are trying to get to a single platform where you enter a prompt and then it goes off and uses the proper tool to get you what you needed that's where this is all headed if you asked me that that'd be my best guess of where it's all headed all right so hasn't generated yet can you take a Tik Tock dancer and an image of yourself and make you Tik Tock dance theoretically you could I mean it still looks a little cartoony like if we look back at some of these other ones that doesn't look super realistic like the the animation still looks like a little bit I don't know something a little weird about the animation still but you can get pretty close let's see so the motion prompt on this was bombastic maybe I'll just try that same prompt later all right how long does this thing take anybody used vigle before how long does it normally take let's see JJ 3D says it does also animate lips uh but more updates it will improve it um vid servers asking if I'm headed to Nab in Vegas no I'm not going to be at NAB this um this month um I was at too many events I went to I went to CES and then I was at Social Media Marketing world and then I was at South by Southwest and then I was at uh nvidia's GTC conference and all of those events all four of those were in like a six uh eight week window something like that they were all really close together so I was doing a lot of traveling and during that traveling I really really slowed down on YouTube video production so now I'm kind of like all right I'm taking a break from traveling at least for the month of April and um that way I can kind of get back on top of my YouTube schedule let's see anyone else going to watch the Google Cloud next event I'm going to be I'm going to be watching the recording of it later but I'm not going to watch it live uh jj3 says Matt do the mix in vigle so what does that mean so slash mix mix a character image into a motion video okay so maybe I did the wrong thing okay so I need an animated video though and I don't know if I have a dancing video let me see what I give me a sec guys I'm going to look on my computer and see if I have a video of somebody dancing because I did make some videos of people dancing not too long ago [Music] um wish I just had a bunch of Rand videos of people dancing on my computer but I don't fortunately don't think I've got any like Tik Tock Style dance videos that I can show off I should have prepped better for this part oh you want me to just go dance live I don't think I can record a video of me dancing while also streaming at the same time and feed that in that might be a little bit complex who does have random dancing videos on their computer I think you'd be surprised honestly I thinkk you'd be surprised um do you need a green screen dance video from the examples I saw no they weren't green screen videos um actually you know what maybe I have some stock video I do have a folder with stock video in it let me see what's in there and at the bear with me for a second here I'm just looking through some of my stock video footage I don't seem to have any videos of somebody dancing unfortunately not too scared to dance dang it I just don't think I could dance and record a video of me dancing and feed it into Discord all while simultaneously live streaming all right well this seems to be a sort of slow process so my prompt that I generated way up here let's see how long ago did I ask for the prompt so 1220 it's not 1228 so 8 minutes later and it hasn't actually processed yet I don't know how long this takes to process um I have a feeling adding my own video and image will take just as long um oh you want me to do it on my phone yeah no I lied I just I don't want to dance on camera sorry let's see Adobe has a website to do Unreal Engine animations oh there's a wind zip uh annoying popup um let me see I I guess that might be one way to do it um let me pull open um what's it called what's it called Adobe what's the animation tool mixamo that's it thank you JJ 3D mixamo that was what I was looking for let me log in off screen here you guys are being very patient with me that's the difference between live streams and actually putting out recorded videos is all of this stuff where I'm just logging in and waiting for things to happen I can edit out and make the videos move fast when I'm live streaming I got to make everybody wait all right here's Mamo so let's do um I'll just do this cap I never know how to say this word cap capora capora sorry sorry for butchering that what what format do I download it in though yeah I don't actually know what file format to download this in to actually Pull It in as a video did my other prompt ever actually some of these animations might be NSFW so and scroll past them quickly kaaa is that how it's pronounced capora capaa Kappa waya Kappa waya I love everybody's teaching me how to pronounce this I think on this one I'm just G to move on I think you guys get the idea of what vigle does I just don't want to spend 20 minutes um you know waiting for it to generate something for me and I have a feeling even if I upload an image with a video I can see that a lot of people are putting prompts in here and none of them are actually coming out but we know what it does we can look at some more examples here just for a second while we're in here might as well peek at what some of the other people have created like here's one of this animated character here's I guess like a yoga pose and then here's the Blended version uh let's I just want to since I can't get it to actually generate in time from me I just want to peek at some of the ones that other people have generated I kind of like some of the more like cartoony ones here's a input image and the prompt was just dancing this is what it generated so what I'll do is once this prompt is done I'll take it and uh throw the finalized video on my Instagram and that way I actually have a place to post it where you can see it uh because I don't think it's actually going to finish generating the video while I'm still on stream here it's just it's too long I think there's too many people it's gotten popular so it's getting bogged down but uh let's take a peek at just like two more and then I'll move on the other two tools that I wanted to show off will actually I think be a lot quicker to to um to play around with character prompt oh looks like you can also just generate straight up images if you want to I'm I'm so afraid of like showing some not safe for work stuff and then YouTube getting mad at me so here's an image of just like a woman in a dress funny cuz it tried to put her in pants it just turned the dress into like a a rber looking thing I guess PR be impressive though honestly like it I don't know you can see like a little bit of blurriness behind the video like as she moves around but if that like blurriness wasn't there and you just kind of saw this video on an Instagram real or something you probably just passed by it not even realizing it's AI honestly Joe Joe fear watch your scrolling Matt by the way Joe fear if you haven't listened to the hustle and flowchart podcast I used to co-host host the hustle and flowchart podcast with Joe fear um and then when I really really got hardcore about Ai and started to focus on AI I stepped away from the hustle and flowchart podcast but Joe still hosts it it's still an amazing podcast go check it out he has some great guests um I'll I pop on the show and and Joe and I chat Ai and YouTube and nerd out you know I don't know once a month or so on the on that show so check it out hustle flowchart you'll dig it let me I'm going to double check one last time yep I got nothing I got nothing it's all these prompts are just too slow so you get the idea of what vigle does it's pretty cool um you know maybe maybe there'll be some like local version of it that we can install on our own computer if we do maybe I'll do a tutorial about that in the future or you know maybe they'll pull it out of Discord and um give us some sort of front-end user face user interface but with more gpus who knows I have no idea when this is going to come back to me so let's just go ahead and Move Along let's see next up uh this one this is actually a really cool useful tool if you're trying to um sort of stay in the no with a certain topic but the funny thing is I added this tool to Future tools I've played around with it a whole bunch I've created my own digest with it and then it took me like 3 days of using it before I realized wait a second this isn't even using AI but it's still a really cool helpful tool so I'm going to show it off anyway cuz I have it on my list of tools to use so I'll go ahead and log in here and basically what this does is it creates a sort of single page to get all the information that you need about like any specific topic so for example I'll show you the digest that I've already made um it it creates a new Gest for me every day at 9:00 a.m. it pulls in expost right now Rowan Chung has a few exp posts um Rowan is probably one of the most looped in people when it comes to AI news he runs a newsletter called The Rundown so I follow Rowan just because I try to keep my finger on the pulse of the news and if there's anything that I ever Miss usually Rowen catches it so I usually find it through Rowan if I didn't find it myself I like to follow the AI explained YouTube channel I think as far as AI YouTube channels go um his is probably uh the one of the most like highest signal to noise ratio he puts out content only when it seems like there's really something important to talk about and I really appreciate that about him Matthew Burman same thing Matthew tends to put out a lot more content around like open source and the latest large language models and benchmarking large language models so I really like watching his content as well David Shapiro's another one so whenever any of these people post new YouTube videos it shows up in this digest I o follow Artificial Intelligence on Reddit so it pulls in some of the more popular posts for the day from that subreddit stable diffusion subreddit open AI subreddit mid-journey subreddit and that's my digest so in a quick glance I can see if there's any news that maybe I missed based on uh some posts on X some YouTube channels that I follow some subreddits things like that and it's super easy to create uh you just come up here create digest it's free by the way too I forgot to mention free uh you've got all of these options here you can add Reddit over here you pick the subreddit so for example I can put the artificial intelligence subreddit and it's pull in as many or as few articles from that subreddit as you want you could uh decide how it shows the layout and then click save and now this is the first thing in your digest let's say I want to add a YouTube channel I want to make sure I know whenever a new video comes out on let's say the Matt wolf Channel I can add my six most recent videos and show those up in the digest as well and so you just kind of build out this like single resource that kind of keeps you in the loop with Twitter with YouTube with Reddit with all of those places going to pull up my Discord make sure the my moderators aren't actually trying to get my attention and I'm missing it so me a second here oky dokie cool all good there so that is um that is called use digest I remember I mentioned the next couple tools are going to be really really quick to show off this one's pretty self-explanatory and again it was a tool that somebody submitted to Future tools I played around with it thought it was really cool went hey I'm actually going to use this tool and then realized later on that it actually isn't an AI tool at all but it is a helpful useful tool all right let me check the comments here Shapiro is higher noise to signal but he also follow H I think you know I think David Shapiro is really really good at sort of sharing his thought process around where things are going to go so he'll see a piece of news and then really go in depth on like what this could mean how this could play out over several years and I love that I love his sort of uh theorizing and his future looking like where am I going to take all of where where's all this headed that's what I love about David Shapiro's content um let's see you should join rowen's rundown University cool I'll look into that I don't know much about it yet uh let's see wolf Burman Roth and Shapiro are pretty much all I watch on YouTube YouTube nice all all good channels um let's see llm toaster coming soon cool all righty so that's digest if I over at us digest.com right now it's free um it does say there's going to be a newsletter feature coming soon I actually don't know what the newsletter feature is going to be um it doesn't really have any details but I've just been using the digest feature and it actually emails me the digest anyway so this digest that I just showed you with Rowan's posts and these YouTube videos and all of these Reddit posts it sent me an email this morning at 9 o'clock with all that stuff in it so it does send you an email and then there was one other tool that I wanted to talk about and then after this tool I will um we could do any sort of Q&A and just hang out and see see where we go from there only planning on hanging out for about 20 more minutes so this should be a quick tool and then we'll you know just chat for like 15 minutes or so uh so on Twitter let's see here on Twitter this um emsar man asked if I can try out orange AI I wasn't really familiar with orange AI so I looked it up and it looks right up my alley so orange AI basically what it does is it looks at all of your YouTube comments and gives you like a sentiment analysis right it says want to read all your yoube YouTube comments in one minute try orange Ai and then uh it looks like I can just put a YouTube video link in here click see viewer feedback and it'll give me like an overview of what everybody thinks about that YouTube channel again you can see why this is going to be a pretty quick um I don't really need to spend a whole lot of time talking about this tool but this is a tool that I need because I do kind of read the comments but also I get bent out of shape by the comments like you know there could be 90 positive comments on my YouTube video and the 10 negative comments the 10% of negative comments like really get into my head and Bug the crap out of me so um I tend to do more of a skimming of comments than I do reading every single comment but you can see uh I've got there there was a ton of AI news this week that's my most recent video I'll just grab the link for this one and I will plug it into orange AI here and see what the comments say about that video oops put it in the wrong place put it here not in the email box all right so preparing your insights may take up to 67 seconds um let's see Brian says he might be thinking of the wrong Shapiro possibly yeah David Shapiro is um he likes to wear his Star Trek shirt on his videos I really enjoy his channel a lot of it is more like um sort of thinking through things than it is sort of breaking down the news all right so here we go this is what orange AI said about my most recent video uh audience liked uh continue covering AI news and developments Explore More on ethical considerations and regulations around AI consider creating more content on ai's impact on jobs and Society highlight advancements in AI voice generation Technologies expand on AI applications in entertainment and creative Industries apparently 20% of the comments had like one of these kind of notes around it um audience requests 60% apparently address concerns about Ai and job displacement with more in-depth analysis provide tutorials or guides on how viewers can engage with AI Technologies discuss the implications of AI in various sectors Beyond Tech like healthcare and education offer insights into how companies are scaling Ai and the infrastructure behind it clarify misconceptions around AI developments and their practical applications so those are the requests and then where I can have some improvement address skepticism around AI advancements respond to to concerns about AI ethics and potential misuse clarify the role of big tech companies in the AI landscape engage with the audience's concerns about AI replacing human creativity and provide balanced viewpoints on ai's impact on traditional jobs so it pulled in all of that information from me just feeding it one YouTube video um you know I try to address as much of this stuff as possible already but it's always great to kind of get the overview of what we're seeing in the comments over on YouTube um let's see let's see K donev mat follow your channel but I don't remember you talking about invoke AI I don't believe I've talked about it on the channel I've talked about it over on the Future tools website and shared it uh but I don't believe I've actually made a video about it yet so this orange AI seems really really cool but there's not a whole lot more for me to explore there's it's free I don't see any way to uh to pay it does say interested in unlimited access so maybe you enter your email and then it sends you away to pay but I don't know I feel like it did what it needed to do with the free version right out of the box so I don't know what I would use unlimited access for um unless maybe you can only can I only give it like one video a day let's see me copy last week's video here to see what happens maybe I maybe it's limiting me and I don't realize it's limiting me looks like it's just generating a new sort of sentimental analysis here xcvi says I cannot get orange AI to work that's bummer this is my first time actually even testing it I literally have never tried it before this live stream so luckily I got it working on the first try but this was this was my first attempt at even using it let's see concerns about replacing human creativity all right so it looks like it just generated uh you know another analysis for that other video the funny thing is if you read it a lot of it looks like it's kind of the same stuff so I I get kind of very similar comments on every video explore the potential of AI and Healthcare especially decentralizing and improving access to Medical discuss ethical implications clarify capabilities and limitations um concern address concerns about the clickbait nature of video titles and thumbnails uh I don't try to clickbait but when I do videos that cover 30 topics it's really hard to find a single title that in covers all those and it's really annoying because if I put like hey here's all the latest AI news and that's the title the video doesn't get a lot of views if I say there's a lot of crazy AI news this week and just add like an extra adjective or two the video gets like four times as many views so it's annoying that I got to play into that game a little bit but it kind of is what it is that's that's the YouTube game unfortunately uh let's see Brian final request please consider 2x a week news even if half the content each time um yeah I might I had I I do one AI news video a week and then I try to do two other other videos like an underground AI type video and then like a tutorial every week I always try to mix it up a little bit the the reason being the AI News videos they tend to get a lot of views uh like right when I publish them so like an AI news video has a lifespan of like a week right I put out an AI news video by the following Friday that AI news is kind of old news and there's a new AI news video dropping so last week's AI news video just kind of stops getting views um but then when I make tutorials or when I make videos like nine underground AI tools that you haven't heard of those videos kind of start off slow they don't get a ton of views right when I release them but then over you know six weeks two months three months those videos ramp up those are the Evergreen videos that attract more people to my channel so I'm kind of always trying to do that balance of here's the timely stuff of what you need to know right now here's the sort of longer term stuff tutorials tools things that you might find helpful if you're actually trying to implement and use AI in your business and I'm trying to always you know keep that scale in Balance but yeah these are all the tools that I wanted to talk about today I'm actually going to pull up mine Studio on the screen again since they're the sponsor of the video might as well have them on the screen uh again you can use the C coupon code friends 100 to get the a free month of the Pro Plan so that's friends 100 m Studio thank you for sponsoring the video If you jumped in late to this live stream make sure you check out at the beginning of the video where I do a super deep dive uh into mind studio and build some automations with it so check that out if you haven't already but I'm going to hang out for about 10 more minutes and uh just kind of watch the comments and see what you guys are saying and you know ask me anything if there's any other uh websites or tools you think I should kind of take a peek at and give my thoughts on happy to do that let's just hang out for 10 more minutes and then we'll wrap this up and uh call it a day got to open up my Discord so I can make sure that I can see when John is trying to talk to me let's see he's asking if we should run some polls we can run a poll what should we poll at least you're not making the videos blank shocked the entire industry yeah um I do notice a lot of videos have that title they everything shocks everybody all of the time I try to I try to go a little bit less click baity than that but I also try to think of a name that's like an overarching all-encompassing name for that video Let's see what do you got what do you got do you need another anchor I can make your extra video teamwork possibly maybe we'll go down that route in the future that would be fun I definitely want to do some more videos that I like co-host with other people I actually thought it would be really fun to do a live stream like this where I'm just talking about Cool Tools and testing them in real time and seeing what they can do um but then bringing on like a guest host bringing on someone like Matthew U Matthew Burman or David Shapiro or Wes Roth or one of these other guys that's making AI YouTube videos and we kind of nerd out together talking about the tool and um you know maybe even do like a tier list like you see all the gamer channels do and talk about you know pick 20 AI tools and place them on a tier list and do some collabs I think it'd be really funny fun to do like collaborative live streams in the future I got to figure out how to do the tech behind it uh we did it once with the Forum so I'll figure it out again but um that would be really fun let's see your 10 best AI tools you never heard of style of videos are the best yeah I'm not planning on sacrificing those uh those are called underground AI this live stream was supposed to be a live version of that underground AI but you know the polished video versions that I put on YouTube obviously have a lot of editing where a lot of people don't know this but when I make YouTube videos and let's say like the 10 AI tools you've never heard of one of the underground AI videos that video might be 30 minutes when I put it on YouTube but I probably spent two hours recording it I probably did like exactly what I did here I flip on the camera talk for two hours try the different tools experiment with them and then me and my editor go back through cut out tools that sucked that I don't even think are worth showing off um cut out tools that didn't work things like that and then I also cut out all of the pauses all of the okay this is taking forever to render so I'll just sort of jump to the final rendered version I do a lot of editing to get those videos down to like 20 or 30 minutes because I can ramble with the best of them I can just keep on talking and talking which you can probably tell by my live streams uh let's see just kind of reviewing questions I think uh John AKA crazy in the dark is going to put a poll in there um we're going to find out who should I collab with first between Ben Shapiro Matt vidpro Matthew Burman or AI explained that'd be kind of a fun poll see what you guys think Paul Harding says I would love to see you Matt vidpro and Matthew Burman yep I actually have never met Burman in person I'm in San Diego he's in La though um we plan to meet for coffee once and didn't actually make it happen I have met Matt bid bro we were both at uh the same event up in San Jose a couple weeks ago let's see which tool do you use to create your thumbnails so I've actually done two or three videos about that so I actually did a live stream here um called let's create AI art and thumbnails back in August of last year I break down my thumbnail strategy there and then also did a video Let's see can I search where's my search I don't know how to search my videos uh there's another video if you just search out like thumbnails um where I basically gave a tutorial but the short answer is I use a combination of tools uh will generate a well two short answers shortest answer most of the times now John AKA crazy in the dark who's helping me moderate this live stream creates the thumbnails for me now so he's making 95% of the thumbnails that we use on the YouTube channel every once in a while I'll play around and make one myself still but most of them are JN uh before JN came on board and helped me with thumbnails the way I did it was I either used mid Journey or Dolly 3 to generate kind of a overarching concept of the image with a person in the image and then I use stable diffusion and like a face swap on stable diffusion to merge my face onto the image so I'll start with mid Journey Dolly 3 create the image pull it into stable diffusion and swap my face on it um all righty so the poll is actually blocking my chat window hopefully if I close the poll it doesn't actually like stop the poll can't tell let's see have you tried x minus Pro yet that is not one I've heard of xus Pro this is not what I've played around with um so I am going to save this one and look back at it later I just closed the pole window hopefully it didn't actually shut down the pole I was just kind of trying to close it uh let's see let's do a LM Coliseum between wolf and Burman when it comes to language models Burman is much smarter than I am he's tested all of the open source models and knows which ones to use for what scenarios I'm still pretty basic I still use Claud and chat GPT most of the time um let's see okay cool John told me it didn't shut down that's good is there an API that allows realistic characters for the AI answers um probably uh haen probably has an API to do that kind of thing what is the best offline AI program Lama so offline AI program there's two things right you you have your sort of frontend user interface which is where you're going to run the large language model and actually see the chat uh for that you have tools like LM studio and Jan are two of them that come to mind real quick uh those will actually run whatever large language model you need them to and then you also have the actual large language models which are things like llama 2 U mixol 8X 7B um you know you've got Orca you've got there's all sorts of Open Source models that you can play around with uh Google's Gemma I think is another one that you can play around with so you need your user interface to actually interact with whatever bot you decide to use and then you need to download the actual large language model weights um as well as far as like which one's the best I still really like using the mixol 8 x7b that's the one that I tend to get the best results out of but I guess different large language models are better for different tasks that really is more like the Matthew Burman area those are the types of videos he makes is like what large language model that's open source is best for this task Matt burman's great at that stuff uh internet kite says Olivio I'm assuming you're talking about Olivio cus uh he's a buddy of mine I talk to him in DMS all the time haven't actually met in person but he'd be another one to do a good collab on see don't meat for coffee meat for beer and will show up I don't really drink beer I will do wine though I'll drink red wine but I don't really drink here let's see there's so many questions I'm having a hard time keeping up all right um what's the best image animator tools depends on how you're trying to animate them um I really like uh paika and Runway they both do a really good job at animating images uh interchangeable sometimes Runway gives me better uh results sometimes Pik gives me better results but you can upload an image give it a prompt and it will try to animate that image for you uh so play around with one of those I think both of them have free trial options both I believe are paid but you can test them for free let's see the AI breakdown Nathaniel Whitmore now that's a name I don't actually know yet let me I'm GNA open up a tab so I can make sure I look them up after this call uh crazy is saying the poll is close save M vid Pro uh woko woxo is a video generator I have looked at that one in the past I don't remember much about it and I just caused them to spend money by clicking on their ad uh boost your YouTube Tik Tok views cool I'll have to look into this one more I have heard of it but I haven't actually played around with it but looks like we've got a way to play with it for free all right I'm going to start wrapping up here but I do want to quickly check the comments make sure that I address anything that needs to be addressed um so much so much so much is Brian says is there a tool that allows a photo of a person or a pet to be used and AI art created around it [Music] um there are uh I wish AP was still on the call he had to drop off but he's he's got a real uh quick memory for the kinds of tools that do that sort of thing I don't know about animals specifically but for um be used as AI art created around it you could use that vigle tool that we were just was talking about too right to create like an animation of the character and then make a green screen and then put a video behind it that might be a way to go uh there are a handful of tools that do what you're talking about I've just drawn a blank on on where to point you right now also look into Runway Runway has a large suite of AI video tools that do all sorts of interesting stuff um log in real quick I know I said I was going to wrap up two minutes ago but I want to I just want to clear out all the questions and comments that have come in all right so here's Runway you can see there's all sorts of tools in here you've got generate videos edit videos with edit videos you can remove background you can do inpainting where you you know remove a person from the the background scene detection extract depth motion tracking all sorts of stuff so what you're looking to do most likely you can do it with a combination of tools inside of Runway um let's see vid server oh wait uh I missed one here Martin any realtime voice cloning tool that allows me to clone the voice of someone I have some hours of recording of uh yes 11 Labs 11 Labs does that great uh I would highly recommend checking that out you can upload like a minute of somebody's voice and create a clone of it if you want use it ethically though use it ethically don't go and try to fake people um vid server would love to use AI to translate your vids to other languages for bigger audiences to enjoy any interest I am interested in that but I'm talking with a company right now uh so in YouTube they actually have a new feature where you can turn on dubbing and you can change the language and it'll dub over in a new language and if you use that dubbing with something like 11 Labs it'll actually be my voice but in that new language however YouTube hasn't turned that feature on for me yet so I haven't been able to add the AI dubbing yet but it is something I'm planning on doing on my own channel is actually going back through taking all of the um audio from one of my existing videos translating it to like three or four different languages and then putting it as a dub feature so you can listen in other languages so it is something I'm working on I'm just waiting for YouTube to roll out that feature in my account so should be happening fairly soon uh let's see you should increase your stream video bit rate on OBS okay I'll look into that for the next stream I don't do OBS very often so I will have to play around with some of that uh thank you thank you when grock though not sure I understand the question we have grock ai with gr okay um inside of Twitter uh grq which is is like the inference engine the the the chip that makes uh large language models run a lot faster we have access to that already right now Dora AI somebody asked if I played with that I have played with it um I believe that's like a website builder right Dora yeah I have played with this a little bit um you basically enter a prompt and it creates like a whole website for you so maybe when I'll go into another um underground AI play around with this one some more okay Waldo saying giving me some tips on increasing quality so I'll look into that for the next one for sure um somebody's asking about the 4080 winner results I do have the results so the thing about the RTX 480 was I went to the that that contest I went to Nvidia and said hey can I get that list of everybody who submitted and joined the uh Nvidia GTC event so I can pick a winner and they said due to privacy reasons we need to pick the winner for you we can't just give you the list I was like okay that's annoying because I kind of wanted to like pick it on stream right I wanted to get on stream and throw them all into a spreadsheet and then use some sort of randomizer tool and pick a name at random so you can see that I wasn't trying to like fake or give it to like one of my best friends or something like that um but they said no I can't give you that whole list so we'll pick the winner for you so a winner has been picked I do have a name and email I was going to announce it in the Discord uh later today but I'll also announce it here just in case they're on the stream but the winner is Thomas Mueller uh chances are Thomas is not on this stream but I will be emailing Thomas they did give me Thomas's email to hit him up and make let him know that he won but that is the winner I'm also going to announce it in the Discord I was going to announce it in next Friday's news video as well um but that's what's going on with that I wasn't able to actually do like a live drawing Nvidia picked for me all right all righty any other questions um John let me know in the Discord if there's anything else that you've seen that you think I should be responding to a lot a lot a lot of stuff has come in so I'm just kind of trying to I'm trying to keep up with all the comments and figure out where to go next um any interesting AI audio units yet I'm not quite sure uh what that means audio units I I'm not uh gov Corp watch I'm not sure what you mean by audio units so if you want to clarify let me know and the comments have already gotten away from me again uh they turned on AB testing for Mr Beast I do have AB testing in my YouTube account we use AB testing with every video we put out somebody's asking about the dubbing I was talking about it'll dub but not lip sync at least not the beginning I could do the lip stinc with ha Jen but then it would just be a completely new video um so not yet that might be a feature like YouTube rolls out in the future though and I think that's about everything cool well I really really appreciate everybody hanging out and I just realized I was showing off some stuff on the screen and didn't actually switch back to my camera again I'm really really dumb about that uh I did show off a couple things a minute ago like I showed off runway has all these like edit video features so the person that was asking about like you know changing video backgrounds and stuff check out Runway somebody brought up Dora I did pull up Dora on my screen but wasn't showing my screen because I'm a dumb Dum and so this is what the Dora AI website builder looks like luckily I didn't do that for the majority of the stream I only did that for the last like five minutes and that's it I think we've answered pretty much all of the stuff there's some other questions that have popped in that I don't necessarily know how to answer um Quantum photonics not sure the reference there so okay I'm done I've been rambling I'm kind of trying to keep up with the comments but there there's too many there that I'm missing a whole bunch but I really really appreciate you tuning into this live stream hopefully you learned about some new tools that you haven't seen yet uh hopefully you enjoyed this I'm planning on doing more of these maybe my next time we'll have a guest host in fact who won the poll I didn't even see the poll results um but maybe the next time I do one of these underground AI lives I will have a guest host and me and that guest host could talk crap about the tools or talk about why we like the tools so much um maybe what would even be really fun is me and a guest try to like stump the other host and try to present a tool that the other one hasn't seen yet now that would be really cool like if I can bring Matt vidpro or Matthew Burman on and they can actually like stump me with a tool that I haven't seen yet and I can try to stump them with a tool that they haven't seen yet that would be really really fun so we might do something like that where we try to find tools that we know the other ones haven't seen yet but that's it that's that's my live stream hopefully uh you got some stuff out of it thank you once again to
