        "transcript": "with J GPD and vs code you can build literally any website even if you know nothing about programming or HTML to a lot of people building a website from scratch seems like an impossible task but if you simply follow what I'm doing you will have a working website and you will learn how to use AI tools like chbt if you're new here my name is David Andre and I love building stuff with AI so let's create a website shall we in fact I haven't even chosen what kind of a website I want to build I will let CH gbt decide that for us so I want to to build a simple website that's very visual give me 10 different ideas if you see the responses are very different from what you might be getting that's because I'm using a set of custom instructions specifically for website building and of course they're going to be linked in the first link in the description we have 10 different ideas let's look at it this could be interesting okay so out of all these I'm definitely most interested in this number six interests me the most how do we begin okay so we have some steps laid out decide what story or concept your animations will convey I want my website to be uh artistic showing the coolest CSS and JavaScript animations let's start simple though I want to get started you know I don't want to spend half an hour on concept and storyboarding I want to get into the programming into the building so as you can see I have an empty index HTML file literally and right now our website looks like this A blank white page but that will change soon if you're working with AI and especially like doing something programming or building something the goal isn't to have ai write everything for you the goal is to actually work with it improve your productivity and most importantly learn this is the best way to learn programming okay so let's see what GPD gives us this is an HTML outline it's a bit longer than I expected from you know the core HTML okay so I'm going to copy it and then go over it thankfully it's including comments to explain everything and okay actually it even added explanation a programmer should be judged based on what he creates the best programmer is the one who creates the most who builds the most stuff you know like you can be an expert in five languages and know all the syntax and have 15 years of experience but if you haven't created anything like anything tangible if you haven't built anything that you can point to anything that you're proud of you're a worse programmer in my eyes than a kid who might be using AI might you know be copying code from the internet because he doesn't know all the syntax or whatever but actually created something of value and completed a project okay head section contains meta tax uh okay actually you know what the best way to explain this would be to hit contrl s and look at our website so this is what our website looks like now obviously still super basic we have no CSS you know styling no JavaScript animations but we have some text this is already interesting it already linked a CSS file even though we don't have one so when creating one we have to name it this so actually I'm going to do that right now I'm going to copy this name and I'm going to create a new file and just paste it and there it is an empty CSS file by the way when you see this you know this is GitHub co-pilot which is an AI tool I use to help me program even faster it's like programming on steroids it's crazy but if you don't have it it's fine you can do all of this with jgb uh actually in the footer instead of contact us you know because right now this is our footer basically it it doesn't look like the footer because we have no you know CSS made by David Andre save Boom the website isn't going to be well I might make it public we'll see we'll see how good it gets if at the end you know it's impressive I might put it somewhere and host it so that you can visit it like chgb already created some you know nav and div um Fields but they're empty I don't know why it's creating all these empty sections and empty divs like I just wanted a simple outline okay so as you can see at the bottom after the footer it links to the Javascript file which again I haven't even created so I'm just going to copy this name that way it's guaranteed to be the same you know I can't make a typing mistake a typo when I just copy paste the main so boom so I'm just going to say the HTML you just gave me includes a lot of empty and unused sections please keep it really simple only give me the only give the most necessary HTML code we will add more advanced stuff later on I'm doing this to you know avoid being overwhelmed for you guys but more importantly for myself because as I said it's been a few years since I've built a website from scratch so you know my HTML knowledge is Rusty and I don't want like all these empty divs all these empty you know navs what's the best way to do it I'm I'm just probably going to delete everything except for the footer and then I'm going to click copy code and do it like this and then paste the footer like this okay so we have 20 lines Suddenly It's just like half of what we had before again if you don't understand some part you can just you know copy let's say you don't understand the he section just copy it and say can you explain this part of the code more forly boom and just give it that part right or let's say you're confused by what diff is or you don't know what this line does like obviously there is a comment but you can always ask it to explain it and that's the key I want to drive home like do not just blindly follow what AI gives you use it to enhance your skills use it to learn more to improve yourself as a programmer and this is the beautiful thing about AI because like it knows so much and you can just ask it the same question 10 times and it never gets tired or bored I have the core HTML outline how do we go about creating our first animation okay I'm I'm just going to say here is exactly how my HTML looks by the way it's good to do this that way you know jgpt knows which parts you implemented which parts um you ignored which suggestions you ignored and you know it doesn't have Perfect Memory in fact its memory is probably its biggest weakness so you want to remind it of of how your code looks quite often like every three or four messages I would say at least okay actually I'm going to ask it about the hero section and again like this might be a dumb question I don't know if I would ask ask this question to you know a programming tutor we'll create a floating animation for the header text welcome to animation hop to give it a subtle yet engaging effect step one CSS for basic styling let's add some basic styles to your style. CSS file well that would be nice because right now it's completely empty this will ensure that your text is visible and positioned correctly before we add the animation okay so let's copy this over and let's go over it because we don't want to you know Skip way too fast so actually you know what I can tell it can you explain the CSS code you just gave me in more detail and then I'm going to give it the code I want explained let's I'm going to act as if I know nothing about CSS and I'm just going to optimize for maximum learning body as you can can see here now if you you might you know be connecting the dots like oh the body probably is influencing how the body H in HTML looks but you know there is five different lines of code and let's say we don't know what any of them do well for like you might know what text line Center does because it's like obvious but let's say you don't know what margin does that's one isn't as obvious right so let's see margin zero this removes the default margin that browsers apply to the body it's a common practice in CSS to reset default browser styling to maintain a consistent consistency across different browsers okay beautiful now obviously font is kind of obvious aial and if it's not available any sense s font will be used as a fallback background color super obvious by the way if you're using a vs code or probably other IDs have this as well but I know for certain vs code the beautiful thing is that you actually see what this you know hex code is so this is white it's not completely white but you know almost completely white if you see it just in text you might not know what it is but using an IDE you can see the color next to it which is beautiful so the background color then the color is the color of the text and the text will align to the center so let's let's hit contrl s and let's see how this looks boom already much better like is insane you know it's like no styling super basic like looks like a child made it in 5 minutes but with the CSS boom align to the center we have you know footer looks nice made by David Andre this looks infinitely better and we just added you know 21 lines of CSS ins aane and this is only the beginning you know I can't wait to add these animations because this website will be in infinitely better towards the end okay the hero selector same as the body it formats this diff it's sets The Styling for this diff which is named Hero by adding the ID you know if we didn't add the ID we could you could just do this and this would be a normal diff in HTML and you know you could just format it if you like diff just replacing this with diff but the issue is that it would do the formatting for all future divs and we just want to format this one so we give it an ID name it hero and then we can refer to it by hash hero okay so then futra jgpt could probably explain it better than me so position fixed this makes the F stick to a position relative to the viewport it won't move even when the page is scrolled okay so obviously not right now we have nothing to scroll bottom zero positions the footer at the bottom of the viewport so there is no you know pixels below the footer width 100% ensures the footer extends to the full width of the viewport so from the very left to the very right padding 10 pixels add a padding of 10 pixels inside the footer to give it some space around the text so as you can see there is space above and below it's not just you know we can we can actually remove the padding to see so padding zero pixels boom there's like no space but if we add 10 pixels we can or we can even do 15 you can see that the text gets some space so bading is inside margin is on the outside basically step two CSS key frames animation now let's create a floting effect using CSS key frames this will create a smooth continuous vertical movement for your header text add this to your style CSS okay let's copy go below this and add it like normally you won't get chgb acting like this explaining everything the reason why it does this here again is because I created the set of custom instructions like if you're doing something that might take 20 minutes then yeah I understand you probably don't want to create a new set of custom instructions for such a small project but if you're working on something for two hours 3 hours or even multiple days you definitely want to spend you know 10 15 minutes um creating new set of custom instructions just for that project so the key frame FL animations defined a simple floating movement Translate Y is used to move the element up and down along the Y AIS so obviously we have free access x y and z now we don't have three access on the website well obviously if we build a three 3D website then yeah but right now we just have X and Y and you know if you know any graph x is U horizontal and y is vertical so this is just you know this alone would only create the animation we have to apply the animation so here we do H1 same as we do with footer same as we do with body this probably isn't the best practice because we should probably give it ID so let's do that actually let's do ID equals and then we can do just a welcome maybe call it welcome and then here we just do hasht welcome that way it only applies to this specific H1 header animation. float animation refers to this is basically like a function I'm sure c gbt will probably explain this right here set to last three seconds and to Loop infinitely e in out makes the movement smooth so let's refresh the site and see so yeah it slows down instead of being like dud that's not very smooth it's like like if this was a button let's say you had an e-commerce store like a lot of Shopify stores lot of drop shipping stores have an animation on the checkout button or add to cards button because it makes you know people more likely to click here is my current HTML boom and by the way when you see me do these four dashes this is something I learned from Greg Brockman you know the president of open AI he did he did this in his Ted Talk and I think it's a good way to you know add some formatting into your prompts and to separate different parts of it that way the language model actually isn't confused what are our options now I'd like to add an animation that's more advanced and impressive your current setup provides a great Foundation to build upon given it's like as as if it's giving itself a compliment it's kind of funny anyway option one canvas-based interactive animation this okay I I'm liking this basically you know this is when you go to these websites and the there's like an animation that works around your cursor or maybe like the particles go away from the cursor those are always really cool option two CSS 3D transform animation create a visually appealing 3D animation using CSS transforms this could be a rotating Cube oh my God this is I might just add all of these like honestly I want to add all four of these they all sound super cool but the but number four is probably the simplest so let's start there okay fantastic choice blah blah blah for this let's create a subtly captivating gradient animation you suggested a particle Network animation how can I create that you know so you can always click this button and change your prompt you know let's say you realize that your prompt wasn't thorough enough or maybe you forgot to include something or maybe you made a mistake in the number instead of you know adding a new message and confusing chbt like that just go back and edit your prompt creating a particle Network animation as a full screen background is a visually impressive feature for a website yes that's why I chose it this animation typically involves dots particles connected by lines moving around in a dynamic fluid man while it's a bit complex it's definitely manageable okay so we're getting into you know some more advanced CSS stuff good we can always ask jgpt to slow down or to explain it further we'll use JavaScript along with HTML and CSS to achieve this step one HTML setup add a canvas element to your HTML file we need to add this just this line of code step two in your style CSS you'll need to ensure the canvas takes up the full screen and is positioned behind all other content so in the background this is the Z index so we do have actually three dimensions you know we have X actually sorry we have X we have y and then Z is where the element stand so you might have image and some text well if the text is in front it's visible but if it's behind the image you won't see it so we do have Z index even though we don't have anything you know any 3D animations per se so let's copy this code and put it at the end of our CSS this is interesting I'm not sure why it formatted it like so you know what I probably should follow my own advice and just ask chgb so question in the HTML should the canvas be around the hero diff you know let's ask these dumb questions and let's find out why it did what it did interesting so I've learned something about CSS so this is only refers to canvases with this ID selector while this refers to all HTML elements with this ID which I guess there is no reason for us to have the same ID for multiple elements but hey anyway let's go back to this long long response maybe I could even you know update this in the customiz directions if you want to do that you just add you know avoid super long responses oh my God man that confus the user prioritize Clarity and simplicity boom step three JavaScript finally we're going to add something to this empty lonely Javascript file you'll write the JavaScript to create the particle Network work the script will one initialize and resize the canvas to fill the screen two create particles with random positions and velocities sounds very cool draw lines between particles that are close to each other update the particle position to create the animation dude okay this is a chunk of code this is a chunk of code what what is this continuing from where we left off here's the why did it what this obviously didn't finish which is very weird I updated custom instructions but they're not going to work for this you always have to create a new chat for them to take effect so for this one unfortunately we won't have the short and simple responses but that's fine help me add the ja JavaScript section the code you gave me cut off in half and you didn't include any since JavaScript since my JavaScript knowledge is limited please help me understand what we are doing I don't know if this is necessary for JavaScript but for python uh you know the indentation is absolutely key so I'm just doing this because it's nice to see okay will this work contrl s oh my god it works yo this is insane it's not really visible but that's fixable in CSS maybe I should make the text White and the background or maybe the dots should be black I'm just going to copy the comments and just doing these comments it's like will help will help us understand much better especially as JavaScript noobs constant canvas we declare a new variable variable we name it canvas and we assigned a document. get element by ID canvas this refers to the HTML document so do get element by ID particle canvas so we find an element with the ID of particle canvas and here it is okay so this is this is important number of particles to display we can maybe play around with 150 we'll see I don't know why the animation stops after a while oh I think I know why because the particles go off screen so we have to fix that the main thing we have to fix is that it's not even visible like I I know I am using a 4k 31in monitor or 32in monitor so I can see it but I assume that you guys probably can't see it so yeah the animations are so cool man I'm so glad I chose this website to build oh wow we're getting way more comments here like way more comments here okay so every time I change the canvas size this basically refreshes but it doesn't change the problem of the particles going away I need to change the background like okay we need to do that right now the main issue is that the particles and the connections are wide see like CH GPT does not see what would be really cool is that if the next version of GitHub co-pilot actually had the gbtv gbt vision API connected to it that way it can see the product like for website development that's absolutely Ely insane okay what what is going on why this this so complex what and now it just said it's a simple adjustment like one of us is crazy here background of the Canabis so let's do that now this is much more visible this is way better uh but we don't see the text I'm just going to do FFF f f FF for the text boom and this works I mean I don't know about you but like this is sick you know like imagine this being your first website another issue is that after roughly 7 to 10 seconds most of the particles fly off screen meaning the amount of connection particles visible greatly decreases how can we fix fix that seems like a good solution wrapping around the edges instead of bouncing me parle wrap to the opposite oh this is this is even better I think option two is definitely the best what exactly do I need to change about the JS file so I guess there needs to be like an if condition here let's see let's see how chgb does this yes so let's look at this code more closely you know we kind of brushed over the other JavaScript but right now this is simple logic so if this.x which means the position this is a reserved keyboard which refers to this object so this particle object let's actually code this manually if this. x is smaller than zero if x position of this object is less than zero which meant it flew off um to the left so you know I guess that way yeah I need to reverse it because camera but actually can show it so if it flows this way we adjust the position of the particle to Canvas that width which is all the way to the right so it flies back in from the right a simple yet beautiful fix and then we do else if instead of just adding another statement we save U compute Power by doing an lse If this. X is bigger than canvas with meaning it flew off to the right then we obviously want to move it all the way to the left such a beautiful fix man and we can actually code this ourselves because we already have this above us now GitHub Cod pallet just gives us the complete solution but let's try to code it right so this.y if the position y AIS is less than zero meaning it flew up we want to change this.y should be canvas. height and then we do an else if this.y is greater than canvas. height meaning it flew to the bottom we needed to teleport it to the top this.y equals 0 beautiful and I think that's all so I've saved this controls let's actually remove delete the empty lines of code I oh I don't like having empty lines of code at the end I don't know I'm sure other programmers can relate but okay F5 boom so as you can see particles are appearing you know look at the edge particles are flying in and those are the same particles we can actually track individual particles maybe if we make a smaller screen see like let's say this one look at this look at this boom and this is is the same the same particle or actually I should probably choose one that's not covered by my webcam actually so whatever let's follow this particle right and boom this is is it's here it's teleported and boom it's here see now we have permanent connections and the website looks much much better wow man animations are amazing just coding and animations so look at this look at how the strength of the connection changes as the particles go farther from each other actually I want to see which part of the code does that um it has to be this one you know because we have the comment we understand it but you know obviously you can understand it from the name that's how you know it's a good name of a function where you can understand understand what it does but let's see if this do less than 100 okay also this is this line of the code does that so yeah stroke sty equals the color which is in this case white I don't know it's interesting we using RGB when in CSS using hex code but both of these obviously can create white anyway I'm just going to include this image so that you understand um how it looks but yeah this is the RGB and then this is the part that divides So based on the distance um I guess influences the strength of the stroke which makes the animation like way more beautiful also we could probably smoo smoo in it out like adjust it to you know maybe connections could be longer CU like right now it seems like they're breaking off too fast like it's staying yeah it seems like the it's breaking off too fast so we can't really appreciate how the connection fades in strength but it's still visible it's still very nice so this is beautiful but if you remember remember this is only one of the four animations we wanted to add so let's scroll back up and let's add one I want to add all four Let's test something you know what let's say I'm like I don't want to scroll right let's say because like this is this chat is getting long so I'm just going to say remember when you listed out the four possible animations we could do with the fourth one being the the one we just added please remind me what the what the other three were and give a rough overview of how we could Implement them into our website as well see with just this one animation we already have 97 lines of JavaScript including comments so probably like 90 so it it does remember I mean it doesn't remember it just searches the chat but why would I scroll when you know it can do that for me like I can do this like when you press the on your mouse you can press you can click on the mouse Bill and you can do this which is way faster scrolling but like even if I didn't want to do this right like even if I didn't want to find this just ask jgpt to do it for you I mean it's AI like why would we do stuff ourselves when AI can do this repetitive boring task for us so yes this was the prompt probably the best prompt it gave me I mean these suggestions like all four four seems super exciting so let's click this button go to the very bottom and it did remember all four I mean it did successfully recall the previous prod I mean we probably need multiple HTML files and multiple JavaScript files for this to be like makes sense so here I probably want to add like multiple buttons referring to different animations and this should probably be a little bit lower but all of that is like simple adjustments okay you know what let's actually let's um fix that so in the welcome I'm going to do uh I'm going to do is it font size I think so wait wait no no in hero in welcome font size yes and let's do 30 pixels save it's smaller okay we have to do more we have to do more let's do 60 I guess it's probably too large so 50 is going to be good and then we should probably align it okay I'm just say I'm assuming it's best we split these into different that HTML files because for the next one let's go with option two doing a 3D animation of some rotating object like a cube in HTML will create the basic structure like diffs for cube faces it's indeed a good idea to organize different animations in separate HTML and JavaScript files for clarity and maintainability here is how you can Implement a 3D roting cube create a new HTML file cube. HTML okay no problem cube. HTML and cube. CSS cube. CSS HTML structure okay you could just copy this and this is our Cube I mean can you even see it it's just so um yeah it's okay the background you know what okay we can just make some adjustments why is this the Border needs to be okay let's refresh much better much better uh the faces can be I mean whatever we can do full red we can do this for seven PX and we have our Cube obviously it looks kind of bad the current version of the cube is pretty medium Joker number one it needs to be centered in the screen not in the top left corner number two the faces need to be transparent number three it needs to rotate on more than just one axis that's what it does number four after the first three steps are fixed we will add some interactive JS element so like this is you know here um the design I didn't have to obviously I had to change the colors because the contrast was terrible but that's the only change I made it looked it looks like really good from the beginning but this is like this is garbage you know so let's go back let's en enhance the cube animation according to your requirements centering the cube in the screen okay so simple change making Cube faces transparent to make the face we can Cho the background color in the face class maybe it doesn't have to be fully transparent maybe we can do like light blue Maybe we can do like 0.15 I guess 15% okay what if we deleted obviously we need a border like hello roting multiple xes modify the key frames animation whoa whoa whoa what what what happened with our footer what happened with our footer wait I think we need we need the CSS we need to copy the CSS from the footer as well and F5 yes okay good good good good why is it it's not in the same position that's tilting to say the least that's crazy why is that not in the same position the footer this is the same CSS oh is it something in HTML okay I can see there's some space on the left here as you can see here what is this okay so I'm just I'm going to ask even though I used the same CSS for the footer in both let's see if jgb can solve this riddle I mean I can probably do a better job because I have inspect element and I can see that the green is the padding and we have 15 I'm just going to ask what's the simplest and easiest fix for this wrap the cubin container in a new diff this and do control V save okay that should fix it oh my God the footer is aligned the footer is aligned such but this is not a cube it's okay wait now now it's a cube am I crazy or was it not a cube it did not like a look like a cube for a second I might be going crazy now that the footer thing is finished let's improve the cube and make it interactive but first I want to like fix the corners because that's tilting me it's it definitely has something to do with the Border one thing that's tilting me is that the corners of the cube are not smooth they kind of poke out a bit I think it's caused by the border CSS might be wrong though here's the current Cube here CSS in full and actually what I want to do one more thing is something we haven't done yet is using the vision capabilities of jgpt so I'm going to take a screenshot that way you can see maybe it helps maybe it doesn't but you know showing it the issue either way it has the text it has the code it has the text prompt so so even without the image it should be able to identify a solution I don't know why it's giving me like five different solution I don't want to experiment with five different solutions use your own knowledge of web development and CSS and tell me which solution is the best practice or which one has the highest best looking Cube and give me the CSS like you know this is kind of a I mean for on one hand like you would learn more if you tried all five different solutions but in this case like I just want to fix a bug and like giving me five different ways to fix the bug is like not as helpful as just I mean it's helpful but at the end it should tell me like this this is the best way or like a professional web developer would probably do this or maybe just give me the simplest one I don't know but like you know if it really assumed that I'm a big iner when it comes to web development and CSS it wouldn't try to overwhelm me like that the best practice foring visual protruding corners while keeping the structure to remove the borders and instead simulate them using a box Shadow okay so we're using a on the face we remove the Border that's funny we don't border and we just use a box shadow okay and that's a fix beautiful that works now I'm wondering whether I even want um whether I even want to have these side panels we have fixed the issues the cube is in the center it's rotating across multiple axes um what the heck is going on what is going on whatever stop now I want to make the cube interactive so that I can spin it into different directions with my cursor however the cube should be however before we do that we should probably make the cube um hold a steady position cuz like you know right now I don't know it probably works let's let's not complicate it how can I Implement that I assume we have to add JS for this I don't I think we can do this in CSS so let's do a new file and do cube.js okay step one add event listeners we will add event listeners to the cube container for Mouse move events to track the cursor position step two it's fun like event listeners reminds me of the good old days when I was like 15 16 building my first mobile game Let's copy it part by part so we don't you know rush it un select the cube and the cube again so declare a new variable named Cube and document get element by Cube this is a okay the issue is that we have multiple files H oh but okay yeah it's not an issue because here we a link cube.js so that's not an issue because it's Works within this document so yeah that's good and then it gets the cube container from the HTML over here oh okay so I guess these are constants and let are variable that change makes sense you know learning some basic JavaScript syntax you're never going to regret writing more comment I can promise you that but you're going to multiple times going to you like the chance of you regretting not having enough comments once a project gets complicated is infinitely higher than the chance of you regretting writing too many comments when the mouse is released set dragging is to false interesting we're using Mouse up or Mouse leave two ways to detect this see like I would never real realize that we have to prevent drag behavior of images and text but AI is infinitely better at JavaScript than me so that's why you want to use the help of AI it's a tool explanation we use Mouse down Mouse move Mouse up Mouse leave event list sers to track the dragging action okay makes sense when dragging starts we store the initial Mouse positions and calculate the rotation based on the movement so this is it set draging through and set the initial X and initial y variables we then apply the calculat rotation to the cube using stda transform property this is here the drag start event is prevented to stop the browser's default drag Behavior which can interfere with our custom drag log logic okay so I guess we have to override the default behavior from all the different browsers okay so is this enough to work contrl s F5 um I mean I'm trying to do stuff but um nothing is happening though cube.js is it linked properly script Source cube.js yeah yeah we have the nameing correct um h i mean we can give it okay so I'm just going to say like I've I've applied all of the steps you just gave me but the the cube doesn't react to my M whatsoever here's my HTML boom here's my CSS here's my JS let's see if it can detect the problem I mean since it doesn't react at all I'm wondering if it's like actually link oh my God again it did that weird movement but it didn't look like a cube maybe it's just an optical illusion I don't know let's see can it detect the issue the rotation might be okay however there are a few potential issues yeah yeah see that's what I thought the CSS is like constantly rotating so it like might be overriding the JavaScript we might have to choose between one or the other I don't know yeah n this doesn't seem like it I mean yeah this is I mean number three is an issue but it's not related to this okay now stop I think the I think I think the option one is the cause of the problem however however before we fix that let's quickly address uh point three which is still a problem as as currently the cube is rotating all over the place why is it so slow like is everything correct like open AI server status oh it's in the API jgpt is good but slow incredibly slow it's like this should be gbd4 turbo right like it's slower than gbd4 from before it's like is it gbd4 turbo or gbd4 Turtle oh no come on it threw an error like it was generating for so long that it threw an error that's crazy okay but I mean we all we needed was this one line like that's in insane like now I like I have no idea why just didn't give us this the fix and then explained maybe I can you know change the custom instructions there actually it's probably a good idea so okay I'm going to add it this here anytime you are implementing a fix always anytime you are fixing something always give the user the solution first the line of code quickly and efficiently only then explained uh how you fixed the problem cuz right now like it does it exactly opposite it like explained what's the issue and then gave me the one line of CSS I needed so I'm going to update the custom instructions with this contrl C save well this is disappointing though hopefully we don't run out of gbd4 messages soon like I even bought this account you know I created a new David Andre CH gbt account just for a recording that way I always have the maximum amount of um messages available but the issue is that you know it's not unlimited like if you go here and look at this it's 40 per 3 hours it used to be 50 I don't know why they lowered it to 40 it's kind of disappointing making your product worse but like even you know like you can when doing some project you can easily run out of 40 per three hours and like that's why I even bought this new like I'm paying extra $20 or like 25 with tax or whatever a month just to have a second jgb Plus account for recording that way I always have the maximum limit ready when I'm about to record but they lowered it by 10 messages why why anyways I I have no clue how many we are on but I suspect uh we're needing the cut off which is quite disappointing but let's see I'm going to save contrl s and does this fix the cube no not at all not at all um okay let's try messing with this perspective 500 oh it just seems like how close we are to the cube I I think it's the rotation is the issue honestly I and the issue with this is I have to hit regenerate even though I want to send a new message okay I'm going to click regenerate bro this is tilting man this is like annoying to say the least you know what can actually do something can do a quick fix which is going to my main let's continue with a new chat and we have 40 more I maybe whatever I don't think I used my main chb in the last three hours so we should have uh should work either way so but I have to you know REM remind it of the project so that's quite kind of annoying but whatever I'm building a website with a rotating Cube however right now the cube rotation is weird I want to make the animation s Mission centered so that the cube is rotating around its access point on here here is the HTML I need to remind it because we we have switched jgpt accounts here is is the uh CSS it would be nice if the AI actually had access to the files like in real time so I don't have to manually copy paste it every time I mean that's what copilot does but actually we can use try fixing it with copilot to be honest let's see um H position each face of the cube maybe this position uh is the issue but I suspect it's more about the rotation okay changes who who the issue encountering the CU beings from the how the rotation values are being calculated and applied in JavaScript code or in the JavaScript code no it's from the CSS uh okay let's see let's see no okay whatever the the issue is that wait I need to update my message because I shouldn't even include the JavaScript because all the JavaScript does is it's not even used okay the JavaScript is doesn't even work right now you know that's for the interactive Cube rotation but okay let's try changing the key frames animation well maybe that's actually my yeah this is a it's only rotating about y AIS I want it to rotate on both axes or at least the cube shouldn't be like so flat you know it's it's flat okay I mean two things number one I want the cube to be chener did a bit of AIS that way it actually looks 3D when rotating number two it needs to be centered middle of the screen right now it's closer to the bottom here's the current CSS yeah we need to change the initial rotation in here let's see what we need to B okay it gives us the entire CSS even though I just need to add one line here centering the cube sure the cube is centered in the middle of scame your content going set up seems great however if the cube still PR okay whatever let's try let's trust chbd and see if it works what this okay I applied this new CSS and both issues persist adjusting the initial fre look me should tilted yes I mean I have no idea why the previous code wasn't isn't doing anything bro am I crazy am I even like okay let's try to delete this like are we okay it is linked beautiful we have confirmed that we at least working for the same file okay let's go inspect element I need to figure this out okay that's good we have the faces C need to we need to figure out the position Cube container yo it's like the bottom half of the Screen Man diff content container what the heck display Flex Center um text we actually debug it perspective 500 okay I mean this does not look real like even a cube in Minecraft doesn't look like this perspective origin display block Cube position relative preserve 3D I mean yeah oh position absolute wow I think the issue is here of the cube container being like the content container um again you didn't solve either issue after using inspect element a bit I think the issue is content container it seems to be only taking up taking up the bottom 50% of the screen let's see if this hint helps chbt fix the issue hopefully this doesn't mess up the footer again that would be tilting like the cube huh but intended but okay like we can't I want to add the interactive U you know part with JavaScript but first we have to make it like at least look good you know this looks good like this looks good I can say that but this is like man come on okay let's try if cgbd uh used our hint successfully whoa wo rest of your C unchanged okay so we only change up to Hash Cube okay nope nothing has changed not a single thing has changed bro uh you know what let's let's okay not a single thing has changed let's try from the scratch write me a new HTML and CSS file that creates a nice 3D cube show an animation of a rotating read cube in the center maybe you know jgb is just confused you can actually delete all of this whatever we we'll keep this because it's going to be probably irrelevant I don't know why it's named index HTML I mean I guess it didn't have the maybe I actually should have started a new chat you know what we probably should do that let's kill this and do BR me let's do a new chat and let's see if it's if it's like better sometimes like it's it's it's weird because sometimes it's actually better to you know refresh cuz like sometimes shbt gets stuck in it some way of thinking or like pattern of thought it's not really thought but like some method some way of fixing things that clearly doesn't work and trying to do that in the same chat can be counterproductive so a lot of times it's just better to start over so we have a new HTML actually one thing we need to uh one thing we need to update is make this cube. CSS Small Change actually I want to keep the footer it's made by David onr it's made by me so you know uh uh uh let's see where are we here in the body at the very end right here okay and then we need to take the new CSS and let's see okay I mean it's literally better than we had before I mean the footer isn't formatted of course we can fix that by taking this pting into the new CSS again it's not the same alignment which is I mean I'm just going to ignore that for now let's focus on the cube actually we for Simplicity man for Simplicity I'm just going to get rid of the footer save save five now this is solid I would probably like to make the phases the Border needs to be black obviously but I think we're going to run into the same issue which we already solved though so we know how to solve it yes but we need to make this a different color so that it actually stands out let's go with yellow this time save oops save yes and I need just need to load up the old CH gbt and look into the fix where was the fix wait I think yeah yeah this was a fix so boook Shadow using a boook shadow instead okay let's see beautiful we have implemented a fix wait we shouldn't be here should actually be here F5 okay cube is centered is in the center and animation is better so like literally this is weird like starting a new chat and going from the start has fixed the issue of the cube not being centered so good I'm just going to say good job you know now how can we make the cube a bit somehow interactive in interactive with JavaScript let's keep it simple and they super simple and clear take it one step at a time we don't want to do massive changes because I'm just happy the cube is rotating and it's centered and it's not weird to make the cube interactive using JavaScript let's start with a simple interaction controlling the of the cube with mouse movements we modify the existing code to add this functionality JavaScript will track the mouse position on the screen just the keep according I mean that's exactly what we wanted to do before but it didn't work so modify HTML add a script tag to include JavaScript in your HTML place it right before the closing of the body tag okay let's copy this line we already know how to do this like we don't have the footer but if the footer was here I mean as you can see code interpreter literally predicted this line it's actually even better because it took the correct file name chbt just put a generic file name which we have for a different you know for this website obviously for this side so we have to use the correct one which is cube.js and code predicted that so I'm going to save this is at the very end you know as you can see even after the footer create a Javascript file blah blah blah whoa this is way simpler than what we had before 50 lines of code this is 18 wow remove the CSS we have to remove the animation like it's wild like how the same gbd4 the same language model can be so smart in one instance and so dumb in the other like what Why did Why didn't it do before like obviously we have to remove the CSS animation since we're now controlling the rotation with JavaScript remove the animation properly from the do Cube class in your style. CSS file yeah I'm just going to comment out the line below right here so you know slash um s boom we've commented out this line and let's test it out and the cube is interactive wow I mean obviously it's we could like I would like to have it spin so then it spins and slows down but this is amazing first step right now the C cube is always attached to my Cur position but I but it should only change rotation when I decide to hold down left Mouse button and drag based on how fast I drag and what direction I moved in the rotation of the cube should be changed as well as the speed at which it it is rotating at one last thing um the rotation speed should slowly Decay over time let's see if can if CHP can do all of that in a single one shot prompt yeah we need to make the logic more advanced modify just to include the logic for most drag rotation based by the way it's fine to keep this because again this is just a function we just created an animation here is where we're calling the animation so we need to comment this out we don't need to destroy it this okay seems like we need to replace the entire JavaScript file let's see if that works so we go from 18 lines of code to 51 quite the jump F5 okay okay it probably need to be okay so left and right seems to be correct uh somewhat up and down see seems to be wrong like when I go up it goes down left and right seems good left right left right up down is wrong and then the the speed Decay is way too fast Decay the rotation speed over time when not dragging okay so we need to do like n99 999 let's see F5 yes whoa what they just modified a cube this is not a cube what the I don't know why that error happens in the past I think it's something with this with the faces being defined I don't know I don't have the mouse button click down so this is a bug see like when I drag and oh but this is good this is very nice but it's still wrong it's still up and down need to fix that okay this works however there is a small issue the up down movement is inverted when I go up the cube rotates down what lines of code do I need to change no need to Output the entire Javascript file is too long rotation x minus equals rotation y okay so here I guess only this line of code let's see okay it's fixed the mouse movement is still weird uh I mean left and right rotation works perfectly but the like the spin no what what like look at this I drag up and then it starts rotating down I Dr down uh this is almost correct it works while I am holding but once I release the cube starts rotating in the opposite vertical Direction example I hold and drag up the cube is going rotating up but when I release the cube starts rotating down also like how much value you get out of AI greatly depends on your ability to describe the issue basically prompt engineering bro okay so here okay I guess here is where we need to do minus F five left right up down oo damn this looks cool man this is amazing like actually okay so what else can we do here how can I make the cube even more interesting maybe adding like a zoom that would change the perspective wait what is it right here perspective 600 if we do 400 okay so let's maybe ask jgpt for suggestions amazing the problem has been fixed now what are some other what are some other things I could quickly add to this Cube that would make it even more interactive now we definitely I'm on the PC like I'm not making it interactive for touchcreen like come on well this animation is so cool man man assign different actions to rents when user C on specific for example on a face could change its color Oo we could add that we could add that I it could be a scroll wheel let's quickly add okay let's quickly add add functionality that makes the scroll wheel change the size of the cube tell me exactly what I need to change do not waste my time I don't want it to be veros so yeah and probably need to you know again disable that into CSS because that might be overriding let's add this part into the CSS I mean into the JavaScript let's see it does not work I think I think we have it doesn't work I think we have to disable SL change some parts of the CSS here's the current CSS code okay wait what they should like the that the cube with and high set 100% of a scene while the face elements have fixed Dimensions skill transform effect the cube itself see change um okay body scene Cube Cube face these four need to be changed I'm scrolling but it's not doing anything nope I have updated the CSS but the scrolling still does not change change the size Cube here is the new CSS and here's the current JS maybe I forgot about the JavaScript I don't know but that's weird oh my god did I do a simple mistake function animate well that's oh update oh my God okay that's my mistake my bad contrl x wait it's should be what bro what happened I think I didn't put this code this should be probably inside oh yes this isn't being listened to oh my God this is outside of the event listener that's a beginner mistake let's see if chgb fixed it copy code save uh this is a bit rough this needs to be 999 why does it like why why does it change it I changed it manually did it ruin no way man I'm not going to ruin the rotation um I'm I think I just we need to do this contr X and we just need to do this probably potentially I'm really like swimming in the blind here save what am I crazy okay this this Zoom works but why why is the Dre why is this oh my God it again upd I don't know chgb wants this to be 0.95 instead of 0.999 F5 okay we have the Bro it inverted the sides that's crazy no it didn't wait it's good oh I know why it is when I rotate the cube oh like you rotate the cube and then it works correctly but then when you like oh okay that makes sense but yeah the zoom Works um rotation works yeah not bad I mean it could be there could be multiple levels but I think this is pretty impressive like if this was your first ever website build like man you could be flexing on everybody like obviously we've used a lot of AI help and like in in order to properly learn HTML CSS in JavaScript you would have to build way more sites than just two I mean we have two you know HTML index HTML Cube HTML only we did two animations so like that that's not enough to learn the basics of web development but it's amazing first step and again like if you want to get the custom instructions um that I had obviously now this is a different jgb account but the we the custom instructions spec specified for website building click the first link in the description that will take you to the custom instructions as well as the code I'll include the code why not I'll also include all the code in in that first link that way you can use it if you want to replicate it you don't have to you know pause and try to retype it or screenshot it or whatever you can just get it I'll include all these six files as well as the custom instructions in the first link description and if you want to see more videos like this then subscribe and let me know in the comments"
