        "transcript": "hi everyone today we will discuss external linking step by step so we have already discussed internal linking external linking is also one of the most important on page SEO factors you know which gives boost we cannot ignore external linking so let me take you through the agenda today agenda of the video what is external linking so we'll discuss what exactly the external linking is we will discuss the step by-step practical demonstration I will take a real case examples and will give you a practical demonstration on this so what is external linking when you are linking your content to the uh you know to outside page means you are connecting your page to a particular we from your particular website let us say do forsh short.com to some other website to some other page it could be any page any portal any website now link from your website to other website it is also called called outbound links okay uh these another term back links or inbound links are sometimes called called external incoming links why because you're getting links from from some other website to your for example your story article so we will have uh you know different video on link buildings and backlinking so link build strategy and backlinking so that would be complete different video but I can tell you what exactly the outbound link let me share the screen of this uh give me a moment so for example uh I take you the example of your story article so let me find that page first your story so test form is our platform where we have the courses so we had written a you know blog post a long ago the guest post okay and we had given a link over there in the post okay and that was direct in redirecting it to test.com you can see over here this is a post on your story.com challenges I face in getting a schools ready so we were having a test on a platform where we were targeting the schools at that time it's a long back and then you know we are getting the back link if you click on this test.com you know you're getting the visitor to your website so in this way we are getting the benefit of the visitor but whether the search engine Google is also finding test formula.com that depends on your story whether whether they're giving a do follow or no follow I can quickly check as well if I want I will right click on this page on this your story page and I will click on view Source info and I can see uh you know here uh if I put the follow page uh I can see here no follow you can also see it's a no follow means test.com do.com is not getting do follow from your story.com page so most of the company provide you no follow uh like lot of uh you know platforms like Kora LinkedIn Facebook they provide a no follow but yes the benefit is that uh you know whoever is coming to this page they might also check your page so that is one so that way will discuss in a detail manner what is do follow what is no follow okay uh what are the different strategy to get backlinking so this is one example that what exactly the backlinking is coming back to uh the presentation okay so coming back to the presentation you can see here that R tape over there always connect the relevant page or post means if you are connecting a link to your blog that link should be relevant to the post means if I'm talking about let us say external linking and I have read a lot about external linking from some others source and I think my users my viewers my audience should also know that particular page so I can give the link of that page to my uh blog post which is on external linking so uh so for example I have a post let us say this all about Microsoft PD so let me show you so this is uh all about you know Microsoft RB pl300 so this blog is about this now I want to connect this particular page so first of all understand what this page is all about this page is about power BPL 300 exam okay we are discussing the complete guide to this exam mod of the exam whats included the format of the exam duration of the exam passing score of the exam the result format validity so this blog is talking about this particular exam so we can either connect another relevant source which is giving uh this particular exam information or we can also take benefit of our online portal which is also having this powerb plus 300 you know we already H have this uh course over there where we are talking about the p300 exam so in this way the readers can check you know the information on this particular blog and they can come to uh they can come to that uh particular uh page this one uh This powerbi plus so that they can buy the course as well in most of the cases we should you know actually put only the relevant page so this page is relevant because this is also giving a chance to the visitor if they want to take the course and it is also helping us in a sales but suppose we do not want to put this link so what we will do we will put some other source of Link which is giving an information of uh this power uh this pl3 exam but there is a catch we cannot give the link to our competitor key website which is giving the same information on this particular keyword for example we are targeting the keyword Microsoft powerbi pl300 exam we should not give the link to a competitive website which is also targeting Microsoft powerway pl300 exam otherwise they will get benefit on the same particular same keyword so it's better to give uh you know the link to some other sources where they are targeting something else for example you can take Microsoft powerbi website where you are get getting the guide the resources to you know to learn this particular exam okay or in any or in this case we can connect to this so I will go to edit post so now I'm showing you how to do this so let me come back to the pp again before I show you how to do this so that I do not miss any other point yes so this this was we were discussing now okay so so before I show you how we connect let me discuss the benefit of external linking so credibility is increased so if you are properly linking to trustworthy sources so this will contribute to eat of your uh your content so so I will tell you what exactly eat so e a e for experience expertise Authority aess and trustworthiness now Google has stated that eat is particularly important for your you know for your content it actually impacts users you know well-being as well because sometimes you know we can connect to the sites which can you know uh which can be uh by scammers or fraud so we have to take care of so Google takes all these factors where we are connecting those sites second benefit is value to audience and overall SE so if you are giving the value to the audience means if you're are giving uh suppose I wrot a Blog about let us say benefits of learning Excel and we I am giving uh a backlink an external into to some other sources where the user is getting lot of excel formulas Excel content so that is good karma from our site so good karma brings good results means the users will like our content like our blog that this particular uh you know blog is connecting to the relevant resources as well so overall SEO gets increased the third benefit is a collaboration if you're connecting in this manner definitely they can also connect you back with some other uh you know resources from their end for example I'm writing a Blog about how to edit a video and I'm connecting that particular blog to to a page where somebody can actually you know uh download something uh on videos editing some something video editing software so user is getting benefit now that company that video editing software understand that okay for sure has given me a link so I can also collaborate in some other manner like we have collaborated with some video editing software recently where you know we had given a back link to them and they have given us a you can say a premium access for one year to their you know video editing software so in this way also you can find the collaboration opportunities so so here we will discuss now uh you know how we should connect an external link so first I will see whether this particular blog is having you know uh external link or not so it is not having an external link I can see from here I can go to the Su analysis the your plugin is already there there's no outbound link so I can connect second I already decided you know I already decided this this uh this is my portal I will go to this particular course where I'm talking about uh the powerbi course let me go to this uh complete powerbi here I'm talking about the powerbi course and the mock pl300 paper as well so what I will do I will connect this link this page link to my post you know so that if somebody's coming to this particular page they can also go over there so the above block covers all consider changes that were made in da 100 examination when it was read P 300 also the all the information that person to know them planning or preparing is also C in that blog now I will add it over here in case you need to uh take a complete course on powerbi including mock L300 you can try our courses you can try our certificate courses on this now I want to share the screen back so this this I can easily link but before that I show you how to do this so let me come back to this particular you know slide where I talk to you these points because these points I will cover when I when I will show you the Practical demonstration I will try to link reliable and relevant content so I was discussing the powerbi pl300 exam so I'm connecting to a page where the person can get can can enroll for the course which is relevant content although uh as I told uh you know uh we should write we should write a particular topic and we should connect to the sources which is more in depth of that particular topic or from where we have research but in this particular case I can also connect you know my page to a page where I have the courses because if some visitors are coming to that particular course page they can buy it so that is also beneficial for me and also it is beneficial for the users because they are getting a particular course an affordable course as well so it is beneficial for both of us how many links this is you know very tricky questions we usually put only one link but yes you can put two to three links four Links at Max some people have taken 40 links 50 links and they are the professional bloggers as well but our idea is that we use only one to two links Max and we suggest to use maximum four external links and uh because you know there are two three things over here one the relevancy should be there if you're putting more links they should be relevant second the user should not find it a spammy third user should not go to other website and you know sometime if you're putting more links the user is reading those pages and they're not coming back to your pages that is also very important one one of the important tipes is always Conn the links in a way that it opens in a different tab I will show you that I will connect this particular link uh in a way that if somebody clicks it will open in a different tab because if it opens in the same tab the person may lost to the page which he or she was reading so always connect the links in a way that opens in a different tab so that the person uh you know whatever the page he or she was reading initially should not be you know uh lost avoid connecting the link to a competitive obviously if you are connecting the link to a competitive post with the same keyword then you are giving more benefit to your competition with the same keyword so avoid connecting those links use anchor text I will show you what exactly the anchor text in a correct Manner and audit your website you can also audit your website to check broken although we will discuss this in link building strategy this is just a point uh we put over here but we will discuss this in detail where I will show you how it happens how to check the broken or a audited links that we'll discuss in a link building strategy video so uh just to summarize link to Reliable relevant how many links we one two four links maximum we use one link always link that op in a different tab always avoid connecting to the link to a competitive post with the same keyword and use anchor text in a correct manner so let me go back to the page okay so here I was talking about I had edited this blog and I had mentioned this line in case you need to take a complete course on powerway including Mo PL now I will just copy this so this is an anchor text anchor text is very natural anchor text is you know is something very visible as well so what I will do I will make it blue and italic so that you know it looks there's a link and then I will put insert the link I will just paste this particular test.com product PR plus because this was something if I apply over here this will open in the same tab so I discuss as one of the tips that we should put in a way that it should open in a new tab so if I click on that setting icon it will give me this option open link in a new tab I discuss the same thing in internal linking as well now I will just update it so this is done okay so this this is blue colored anchor text okay which I have written in a very natural flow of the blog so that users do not get confused users also do not find it a spammy okay so in this way I put an anchor text over there now I update it so once I update it I can you know again scroll down and see the SE analysis about this external linking part so let me scroll down okay so in my video it always takes time because I'm showing in a practical Manner and showing you step by step but I hope you will not face any problem and you can also you know crack until you can understand how intern how you know back end looks like uh especially the US plugin how does it work and all so you can see now the outbound link is green good job because we put the link over there okay so we found it relevant okay this blog was talking about Microsoft powerb pl300 so we found it relevant link although it was from one of our course page but we found that you know it is relevant we uh we can also you know put another link from Microsoft website where the resources of mock pl300 is available so as I told we can put as many links as possible but we suggest one to four we are putting one over here just to make you understand so we use the relevant link over here second uh it was an anchor text okay and somebody going through they can also understand there's a link over there they can click and they can come back to this uh particular course page so this is is one now coming back to this uh slide again so reliable always in a different tab this I we did we are not putting in the same keyword Anor Tex so this we have done now I will show you uh another example let me check if I can do or not because this is all about outbound link or external linking okay back linking is something you are getting a link from some other sources I showed you one example the your story now interesting thing is when I update it I have already updated it now I go to the Post so if so now I have given it by default I have given it a do follow link so we will understand do follow no follow in detail in a link building video but yes do follow is something where the search engine can follow the page which you have linked so which page I have linked over here I have I have linked this page this anchor text and this page if I click over there it is opening in a new window new tab sorry and I can see uh this page over here which is relevant to for my users as well so now coming back to this page if I click right click and uh do uh something over here just right right click and view page Source okay uh now if I check the source page and control F I simply the follow so I can see uh I have given a follow you know do follow link to this particular page what content is the content on this particular post having a follow but still I want to show you something more so follow follow you can see over here okay follow the this over here you can see the no follow so whatever the Facebook page I have put on this particular page maybe at the end of the blog or on this particular page that is no follow similarly LinkedIn page is no follow so because that is you know standard that we are putting on all the pages of it so that is no follow otherwi it looks spammy this is no follow okay so you can see the follow page over here okay so this was about I can show you again this page so this is you know uh this content of this particular Pages do follow so it means I'm giving uh uh you know an idea to Google search engine that you can follow the pages on this particular uh page so that is do follow so that by default is do follow if I want to make no follow I will make it no follow but I want to give it a do follow right now so this is there okay so so this was all about the external linking I would like to Quick recap of it so we discuss what is external linking so linking your content page externally outside a particular website so backlink we will different discuss in a detail manner what is backlinking that is you getting a link from some other website we call it external incoming link as well I showed you example of your story article so uh today we discuss link from our website to other website that is outbound link always connect the relevant pager post we discuss the benefits as well we also discuss how to do in a practical manner so I hope you like this video I hope you find
