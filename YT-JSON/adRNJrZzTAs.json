        "transcript": "before going to validations I would like to request you guys please if you are watching my videos please subscribe my channel and if you like the video so please hit the like button as well and you can also share if you want with your friends so you can see I have a little bit change in our form so that I have done the coding part I have done the HTML part and CSS part so that we don't have to invest more time in it so I'm just EXP that how I have done it so for that uh in our signup.php this part is same and for the body inside form I have just added this for each and every element I have written it like this so I divided the column so the whole column actually takes a uh 12 parts so for that I have divided first name that is this field label field in file so so you can see call lg5 and then I have divided it in 7 so 5 and 7 = to 12 so this whole portion takes the 12 columns so that is divided in this manner similarly for the last name and every other field so that is why it is looking like this now and since the user will be signing up so there will be a possibility that user moves to sign up but uh he or she has account on the login so we can go to login and just login it so what I have done is one more thing that is for the address field now we cannot recite it so going to our base. spaces now we don't need these things so let's remove it and now if I refresh so that won't impact yes so apart from that I have made the heading of white color with this cursive font family font family is is used to define and the fonts fonts so for that I have given it out white and font family cursor you can see this for the sign up I have given one class that is head so that is defined here and for the label Styles I have given the color of white so you can see these are of white color now and with these fonts so if we didn't get this font then it will try this otherwise it will try this so that is done and align item align item Center means this level will get aligned to this text field on the center so that is align item Center and for the text box you can see they are somewhat rounded now so for that I have used border radius 5 pixel and B of Aqua that doesn't matter and height of 36 pixels because that is now what looking good so I have given it height of 36 pixel and pading of 9 pixels from left so this this field is now not touching from here so it has some space with that padding left mates now if we go on to here so I have used the label and d and for the labels I have given label style so that will that will be used for these and for input type equals to text you can see uh I have text box class here Define so that is using this CSS and for the text area since you cannot see the resize button so for that you just need to write resize colon n so that will remove that resizing resizing thing and the similarly all these things as a text box so we have defined but I have also introduced the height to at so that it will look bigger as compared to text cles so that is done and on Focus or Focus visible so these are the things which you can see from here like if you click on inspect and if you want to change anything of this so go on to PO and hover you can select Focus visible or condition so you can do it all this from here like I have added CSS for Focus visible so you can see that CSS is now visible for this so Focus visible is done now going back to our CSS I have signed up and login button so I've given that width of 100 pixels and pattern of 10 and6 so that is like this if I change it if I change the padding you can see on the UI that this up and down padding is changing and similarly for this cont to shifting so pading is already because I have given itth of 100 and if I increase the WID so it will be like this so that is also and after that I have a link Tex so link text is this one because user can log through the sign up page as well so user can go to login so I have given it a link already have an account then you can just go to log so for that I have used link text let's move on to here and you can see it um link text this is so that should be because I have used just useful F so you can use D or whatever you want it depends on you already have have an account for that I have link Tex and I have given some one family and since this this is an hyper link so in my earlier videos I have showed that how we can add a hyperlink so with the help of a I have added this login. phsp file so when the user will click on this then it will be redirected to login page and since by default all the links are of blue color and have underlined so I have removed that from here so a and text decoration none that will remove the underline and color from Blue to this and when we hover into it then it will change this color to this so you can see the change in color and one more and important thing is I have used login. phsp I haven't write written it like SL login.php because if I write it slash then it will move to our base path that is it will go to zap SD dots and here here it will check for that log face but since we don't have it here we have it inside our demo so we will just try without slash and it will check for that file inside our project P so so we will use it like this and similarly I have earlier used it like this so we don't need SL demo we can just try CP then also it will work and similarly for the login we don't need SL demo and this now if I refresh so this is our form till now and if I click on login so we have log page similarly as we have in the sign up uh in the login I have sented don't have an account then user can sign up so that is done like this so that is what sign up and log you can see here so that is done now if you move on to sign up page and for the Lo for the sign up page uh talking about the validations we can just simply write on all the fields like this so for all the fields ifp add required then those fields if the user click on submit button then user need to enter the value otherwise it won't submit let's do it like this yes so I have all the PS and then in here just for the text area in here I will write required and save now right now I'm not refreshing it because if I click on sign up then you will just see this that is it has added something if I go to our database so it has added the black we don't need that and for the email field it hasn't shown any validations so now if I click on if I save it as required and now if I finish the form now if I press submit so now it is showing this validation because we have added the validation by just adding the required so for each and every field test and now if I press sign up so it will show because we have added all the field as required so we need to fill all the values now that is mandatory so one way for adding validation is like this with the help of required attribute but the drawback of this attribute is we cannot add any custom message so that is why it is not not good to use this required keyword required so we will use the other approach and before that there is one more thing you can see we have like if someone gives any information here so that information will be showed in the URL bar as so that is also not a good appoach because if I write any password Here 1 2 3 4 and let's say any Dy text and for the passord I say this and click on sign up so we cannot see password here but we can see password here that is not good so that is why we going to using form submit we will we will use on clip submit method this and if you using form submit then these will work but if we are removing the form submit and we are just using the on click of button we will submit the form then this won't work so let's firstly try it without removing this and adding the C something so for that let's move home from here and then let's take this button of input type button and let's add one ID to that should be sign up so ID will be used by the help of Dash so we write hash of sign up so that is the IDE on click off this button so on click of this button we need to use these things we need to do these things so for checking that it is working or not let's first comment it and add simple message now it be refresh it and I click on this so work and you must have noticed that now it didn't show the required message because I'm just clicking on Final submit button and we have the required but it didn't show the required so that is why I have set the required one so for that we need to add the validations so now let's uncom everything and now let's since we have the values in these variables so we will use these variables for adding the validation so using the if method if condition if F name is doual to then we will do something l so we will use l because we need to check every so just copy it and we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 78 k so 1 2 let's 3 4 5 6 7 so here as because if all the fields are validated then we will do the form so form submit sorry form submit by clicking the button we will just do the post so now if we have this field as blank then we will show the message in our UI that this field cannot be left BL similarly for last name and similarly for email mobile and then telone then password password password and confirm password so that's if you want to show a single message that is if any of the field is left plan so we can just write it like and using this and we can just write all the names and just simply do one but since we will show for each and every that this cannot then write it this like name cannot similarly the last name is blank then we will say last name if the email is blank then we write email Mobile plan then can and actually we don't we don't need telephone toat because if anyone is entering the mobile number then so for the address Field address passw and why I have written password and confirm password in the single field because we need both these things and will just show a single message that confirm and confirm password or password cannot that password password cannot be left then now if confirm password and password are not BL then we will write one more then since nothing is blank so it will go inside this else condition then in here we will write one that is if password is not equals to confirm password so if password is not included to confirm password then it will show the message that password and confirm password does not so that is like this if they match then we will do the condition and inside we will the now and now I refresh that is our found and you can see it is checking one by one so firstly it went to this and if this fails then it won't execute further and it will just show this press so t usess on sign so email can't so it's working perfectly so let's take a test us [Music] notat let's write it 1 2 three and so it is saying doesn't match but I hav password so anything WR password and confirm password so instead of hand to write R so it will say both now test user three can just forward sign up so it says cannot be because we have left it now if I write one for here and then it says password doesn't match so it has gone there inside that condition and if I'm writing the same password then it should do the conso Suess this so it has done the post request and submitted all the values which you have in our form now if we go to our database so we have this so we have added the validation in this manner and this thing in in this manner we can customize our M so that is somewhat better than this required so let's move from our that is so that is our Val and in our next videos we will be using like we will if someone has done the sign up then we can just do the login and we will work inside the homepage so thank you guys and please subscribe bye"
