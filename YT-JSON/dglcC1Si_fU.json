        "transcript": "hey gpt3ers do we have a doozy for you today chat GPT has just released their API I'm not talking about GPT 3 which we've had for a long long time I'm talking about chat TPT 3.5 turbo and not only is this faster than the previous GPT version we were using this is 10 times cheaper I'm not kidding the previous one was 0.02 cents per 1000 tokens this one is 0.02 did I do enough notes there and you get the point 10 times cheaper so what am I so hyped about well we're gonna put chat GPT yes the chat gbt inside your home Alexa and we're going to do this for free and fast so buckle up hit that like button and let's Dive In [Music] thank you okay to start off head over to openai.com if you don't have an account then sign up it's also free and if you do then log in and I'll meet you there for those that are signing up you get 18 for free uh you have to use this within the first oh three months it is um but that gets you quite far I'm going to show you in a minute just how cheap these apis actually are to run all right so let's log in if you're new here follow me if you have an account just wait here one second uh so let's hit personal and do manage account head over to um billing there we go billing and then payment methods add a card and you're good to go as mentioned you won't be charged anything up until the first 18 you can add usage limits this so this makes sure you don't go spending crazy I've got a couple I've got my hard limit so that means no more pocket money for me and that's fifty dollars and my soft limit they're like gives me a little warning that's at thirty dollars once you're all set up head over to personal and do view API keys for those of you that don't know an API key is basically just a way to communicate with another application and is tied to your account so keep this safe don't show it to anyone because if someone uses your API key they could run up and build so to generate a new key uh you need to delete the previous one so obviously there is one two three four five six about five or six API Keys allowed so I'm going to revoke one and create one so this is my new API key let's put that somewhere safe word of warning actually once you close this window you cannot see the API key again there's no reviewing it so you have to put it somewhere safe if you do lose the API key or you don't have access to it just delete it and start afresh as for prices so let's head over to pricing and this is the previous one everyone was using is DaVinci 0.02 cents per 1000 tokens I will tell you how much a thousands tokens is in a second and if I can pull up the email I had there we have it so 10 times cheaper 0.02 so we can do 10 times the amount so this this is just fantastic API whisper coming soon we'll talk about that later so now let's head over to uh tokenizer I'll put the link in the description so tokenizers basically tells us how much our prompt and the answers you're paying for both remember you're playing for the prompt that you're asking the AI and the results it gives you so let's imagine this is our prompt um and let's put that in so this is 79 tokens so it's not that much actually and I'd say a response might be about three or four times that so this if I was using DaVinci 400 that is probably about one cent it is one cent Now using the new chat Super Chat gbt so that would be 0.1 that's right yeah um cheap all right so how can we use this and why I'm excited because we're going to now put it into our Alexa we're only going to be using one program for this and that is voice flow um I've been playing around with this for the last few days the support isn't really that good but uh the application is great the documentation is fine uh and I've really been enjoying it I have no affiliation whatsoever um it's just a fantastic program and you will see why shortly why this combined with Chachi with t makes an awesome well Endless Possibilities really previously this week I was speaking to Danny Richmond uh he's an SEO specialist and he's also has a YouTube channel where he Tinkers with gpt3 and I was looking at all of his articles from 2021 uh and it had like this awesome Alexa chatbot um and we tried it him and I both tried it and it didn't work anymore unfortunately but there were some limitations it was using the old DaVinci you could only ask one thing you could say write me a story about X and that was it so it was very very limited and primitive but we have a way around that now and this is just so easy to roll out you're going to be mind blown so anyway voice flow uh before I dive in pricing it's free but what we need is free we've got two assistants that's two chat Bots one editor that's you uh unlimited views one workspace that's all we need um if you ever did want to make the billions and sell your chatbot and you can upgrade and stuff but for now this is just fantastic uh so I can't knock them for that so let's do the login uh create an account by the way and uh I'll meet you there okay so as I mentioned this is the free version so we can only have two Bots I was tinkering for the last couple of days um so we're good to go so once you're on your dashboard um all we do is to create assistant now give it a funky name similar to Danny Richmond's app I'm gonna make a children's one where it has a lot more variables so we can say about the age it doesn't have to actually yeah we don't have to do children we can make the story around the person that is asking speaking to Alexa so it doesn't matter what age you are you will like the story so let's call it the magic book so here we want to launch and Host this is super important because we want to be interacting with Alexa but we don't want to be doing all the nitty-gritty of like Lombardo and hosting everything so this is ideal so we just say you sort it and we make the fun stuff continue Channel click Amazon Alexa and Locale make sure you select your location your country because um there is a difference between the electric stores and it's just just put your own one create assistant okay so this is super simple to use uh let's start off by go to settings if you're on the PC of course and then we want to scroll down and change this to Mouse it's by default and trackpad which is annoying um so default to Mouse and then go back up to designer one so this is our start and this is our chat bot so right now we start here and it just says this is your first assistant I'm gonna delete that all right so the tools here we have events these are kind of like different chapters so if you've got a start that's one event if you've got help that's another event you can have your different chapters down here so it doesn't get too messy so now we want to interact with the robot and have it talk so here we have speak where the robot speaks text to speech audio is playing a file displayed is your fancy Manatee elixirs that have your screens and your kitchens you know who you are and the others aren't too important AI okay uh this I'll show you this later actually is very useful when you're creating a chat bot and it says welcome Alex you don't want it to say welcome malnut drug every single time it would have too repetitive with this you can say Okay create me 10 20 variants welcomes greetings Alex how are you Alex these type of things so yeah that's quite useful um so yeah we'll go over that listen is you asking the chatbot to listen for a response so this could be either multiple choice or capture response so this word listens to the whole entire aspect of what people are saying and the logic you don't need anything down here um okay let's start okay so first of all I want to have a little speaker and we're going to call this block something that we're going to remember um welcome so now click on the white square and here is where we talk about uh or here is what we write what we want the AI to say welcome what is your name and then here we can choose the AI voice I'm in the UK um GB Amy um and you can set that as a default and have a listen welcome what is your name okay let's try Amy Maybe welcome what is your name Emma welcome what is your name I'll go for Brian I'm a Family Guy all right so we have our welcome and for those of you that know after effects we've got a little picky whip uh so a little a little snake to drag on there and now they're connected if you want to have a listen to this just hit run run test welcome what is your name and it didn't really sound like Brian did it oh you're Emma aren't you okay um sorry there we go all right so moving on um we want to respond to this so we can tell him our name um tell Brian my name is so let's go down to listen capture drag it under so the Box opens entity we want to collect the entire user reply once that's clicked we want to save this reply in a variable so a variable is like a bucket it's a bucket where you can store information so they have different buckets like one bucket could be name one bucket could be location so whenever we want to have an access that information we can just check the bucket to see if is this changed or if it's updated so we want to create a bucket a variable and we're going to call this name original okay now we want to create another event so go back to speak and we're going to call this how old remember it doesn't matter what you call these this is just for your reference when you do get quite complicated it's easier just to read what it is and then audio we want to listen again oh no I haven't I need to speak uh how old are you actually what we can do here is we've got my name already so to make it a bit more personal we can do a variable open that and we're going to pull what is it the name name there is it so it would say how old are you Alex good picky whip back to the top and then it doesn't matter where you place these these are just kind of visually so it makes sense to you all right now we want to go next uh one more I think talk speak oh I need to do the answer sorry uh Choice capture there we go I want to listen to everything and we want to create a new variable and we're going to call that page the variables are case sensitive so remember what you do what you type I always type the first letter of each word capital uh just easy to remember how are you story drag that in talk oh no so click here what type of story I don't want to say Alex again it'd be too pretentious Alex Alex Alex you can add effects if you want so these are speed emphasis and everything but I don't want to dwell on this I want to get to the meat and bones uh so let's do another listen capture uh capture the whole reply let's call this story create new variable all right so now we've got our sequence set up we're gonna have a listen actually run run test welcome what is your name Alex how old are you Alex it's very high pitch by the way always make sure this is clicked on microphone so you can hold down space 39. what type of story would you like all right so nothing all right okay let's end this sorry about that so we've got a story now we want our API on this menu there's a secret menu here I don't know if you've seen it yet if you go here there's a little arrow they don't want to scare you I think so API that's what we want and here we have all the details and here is where the fun starts so open AI release a Blog today um and in that blog they give the details that we can make this API with so let's build this so I'm going to go through and show you what is what and here's what I made earlier so uh API so we want to set this to post not get posters it's giving information uh headers we want content type application Json this is all on that sheet by the way um here we go authorization content type so make sure the setting is on post here's one I made earlier by the way and then we want to post in this URL I'll put this blog post here so the URL is this one then the next thing is in the headers expand it once and we want content type and application Json other is also here and then authorization type and then we want to type Bearer space and then paste in your API key that we've got earlier so Bearer space and then API key parameters so basically this is what variables is it going to be having access to so I've already got story here whatever variables I've got agent name so let's add that in okay so it's going to have access to these three variables now scroll down on the body we want to select raw um I couldn't get it working with the previous so hit Raw and then we want to type well they gave us an example here so it's from the curly bracket curly bracket so model GPT 3.5 hyphen turbo and then message so what I've done here is I've deleted this we've kept the role in the user so I got role user and then the content is write a dramatized story of 800 words about story let's add to this for uh age year old let's not do child because it might be 40. I'm a 40 year old child um age-old so they're sorry let me just read that again uh create a story and words about let's get rid of that for a 30 year old about a person called there we go cold uh let's delete that delete that and on the theme of name Alex from the future here that should be on the theme of story my son was wondering why these stories weren't making sense yeah on the theme of story so you've got all three of your variables there okay [Music] so we've got that and that should spit us out a lovely story um let's hook this up and we can send a test so Story horror age 50 name Mike send a request super so here we've got our response so what we need to do here now is we need this is our Json and so we need to use an array to Target it so this is the first one we so we want to go in here so we've got choices so it's going we're going to capture that response and we're going to save that response to a variable and the variable is called API response I haven't actually made that have I delete that and we need to create a variable um API it doesn't have to be called that it's just something that I'll remember okay and now we can do speak and then success goes there what we could also do is talk um actually I couldn't generate three variants of that so there we go so if it fails it comes down to here on the top and then we can just Loop Round back here again oh all right success so we want Brian now to read the story API response and I think that's pretty much it so let's let's try this out and test welcome what is your name Alex how old are you Alex seven what type of story would you like about monsters and grizzly bears okay so there's little pause or sends but it's a lot quicker than it used to be so that should take about three two once upon a time there was a little boy named Alex who loved to play sport all right let's stop that um I think we're pretty much ready to go um yeah so let's head over to settings give it an invocation name so this is what do you call or what do you say to Alexa when you want to use it so say the magic now we'll head over here and hit publish uh special magic book while that's going uh go over to Amazon developers and create an account so it's developer.amazon.com create an account it's free and once you've done that oh sorry while you're doing that make sure your email is the same email as your Alexa and the same email that you use for webflow because otherwise things can voice flow sorry as always things can get a bit messed up all right once that's ready we can test on Alexa so let's go over to this button give that a punch and this will bring the developer console and so what we can do now is a special the special Magic Book hmm I don't know that one the special all right pressure talk the special Magic Book welcome what is your name all right um so I'm not going to continue that because I want to try on the Alexa so I'll see you there in a minute I'll be using my phone by the way so sorry I don't have a camera so sorry about the bad filming pretty good okay so I'm going to try doing a different name just to debug this I'm not sure it's not working now save model go back here test one sorry I don't know that okay let's close that go back here change here test one let's call them both because all everything is test one okay good that name's changed let's republish everything and we're going to call it test one everything can be test one upload so what this is doing now it's republishing everything all the details uh to to the Amazon developer console so it should be ready for us to pick up in a second test one welcome what is your name that's more like it okay so let's try again I'm going to go over to my phone and we're going to try Alexa so here I am on the phone in the bedroom with my laptop so Alexa test one welcome what is your name Alex how old are you Alex eight what type of story would you like a story with dragons and ninjas now it does the computing and Alex's great adventure oh once upon a time there was a little boy named Alex Alex was a kind and adventurous Boy Who Loved to explore the world around him okay I'm gonna end this one there thank you so much for watching um this this really opens the doors to many possibilities uh I'd love to see the things that you guys are going to be making uh please please please hit subscribe and if not a like working hard here um so yeah like And subscribe and take care everyone goodbye [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you"
