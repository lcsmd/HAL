        "transcript": "all right here we go with windows 24 H2 which you probably thought was going to be called Windows 12 but is not they're sticking with Windows 11 this year and they're just calling it 24 H2 but there's a lot of new stuff now the one thing we're going to look at today is pseudo now if you're a Unix head or a Linux head then you know all about pseudo pseudo is a command that lets you run things as administrator from a prompt that is not already administrator so I'm sure you've done this a thousand times in your life let's have a look I'll just run CMD and I'll try a command that I know will require hibernate and we'll turn hibernate off oh but it says I can't because I'm not administrator I didn't start this prompt as an administrator so what I would normally now have to do is close this prompt go start a new one find the shortcut to CMD right click on it pick run as administrator launch that start a new console and then redo the command we don't have to do that anymore thanks to the pseudo command let's have a look so if I rerun this command but I put pseudo in front of it what will happen well so far nothing because pseudo is disabled on this machine and you have to go and manually enable it now a shortcut for getting there is to just hold down I guess it is control and click on the link that should take me write the settings and I can say enable pseudo right here I'll just say turn it on and we'll get a UAC confirmation prompt now if I click the drop down which you're going to want to do here because there are a couple more options the way it defaults it will actually launch that new window for you and do everything that we talked about in those manual steps kind of behind the scenes and then close that window and your thing will go away but that's not how it works in Linux it just happens right in line so let's change Windows to do it right in line in line there we go whoops dragged my head now we should be able to close out of this now if I run pseudo power config slh I get a UAC prompt I say yes and it just happens magically and it works as administrator and that's really all there is to pseudo now there are a couple power options here that you can look at if we type pseudo- question mark well pseudo slh slh command not found what if I just type pseudo there we go pseudo run you don't need that apparently pseudo config pseudo help so I can say preserve the current environment and pass all my en environment variables forward into the new session I can say put it in a new window disable input put in line as we did in the settings change the current working directory number of other things help version but 99% of the time you're just going to type pseudo followed by the command that you wanted to run as administrator the whole time so why is this so great I mean you could just run as administrator the whole time and that's the rub that's what they don't want you to do everybody should be running with the least credentials and the lowest power level in terms of security that they can until they actually need that power and then you judiciously use the pseudo command when and only when you need it make sure you're subscribed for for helpful Windows information like this check out my book on Amazon the link in the video description thanks for joining me out here in the shop in the meantime and in between time I hope to see you next time right here in Dave's Garage"
