        "transcript": "Local Voice Assistance with Wake Word in Home \nAssistant! Bye Bye Google Home and Alexa! Okay Junkie, Office Back Off! Okay Junkie, \nOffice Back On! Yes! Home Assistant now   supports local voice assistance with Wake Words! \nYou can even create your own wake word! And,   with this ESP32-S3-Box-3, it’s even \nfancier! Let’s ditch Google Home   and Alexa and say hello to Home Assistant to \ncontrol your devices locally using speech Home Assistant did it! In the last month of \nthe Year of Voice, the wake word implementation   is finished, so now you can control your \ndevices seamlessly using voice assistance   locally in Home Assistant! And, if you use \nthis ESP32-S3-Box-3, you can set it up in   minutes on your Home Assistant instance! \nAnd I will show you how in this video! First of all, you need to use Home Assistant Cloud \nor set up a local Assist pipeline. If you make use   of Nabu Casa, you can start with this tutorial \nright away. If you want to use a local Assist   pipeline, then please follow this video first \nwhere I explain how you can set this up easily   in Home Assistant. I use the ESP32-S3-Box-3 \nfor this tutorial, but this also works with   the ESP32-S3-Box or the ESP-32-S3-Box-Lite. You \nwill find a link to purchase the ESP32-S3-Box-3 in   the video description. However, obtaining one may \nbe challenging right now due to high demand. In the next steps, we will set up a Wake \nWord in Home Assistant and make sure that   our ESP-S3-Box-3 will recognize the Wake Word \nand trigger the devices in Home Assistant. I   already have the ESPHome add-on installed in Home \nAssistant, but I’m not certain whether you need   to have it installed before following \nthis tutorial. If you want to be safe,   you can do so by going to Settings -> Add-Ons \nand searching for ESPHome in the Add-On Store. Now, let’s enable the wake word!\nGo to Settings > Add-Ons. Click Add-On Store.\nSearch for Openwakeword. Click Openwakeword.\nClick Install. After installation is finished, turn on \nWatchdog and Auto update, and click start. After the add-on is started, go to \nSettings-> Devices and Services. If everything goes well, you will see an \nOpenWakeWord Wyoming Protocol integration. Click Configure.\nClick Submit. Click Finish.\nNow we are going to connect the   wakeword integration to our Voice Assistant.\nGo to Settings > Voice Assistants. Click Add Assistant.\nGive your voice assistant   a name. In my case, I call it Nabu, but \nyou can give it any name that you want. Select the Language of your choice in \nthe Speech-to-text section. In my case,   I choose American English. Please note that \nyou can only choose from a lot of languages   if you use Nabu Casa. If you use a local \nassist pipeline, you will probably only   see one language that you can choose from.\nDo the same for the Text To Speech section. Finally, select the Wake word engine. \nIn our case that will be openwakeword. Then, select the wakeword \nof your choice. In my case,   I choose Ok Nabu. At the end of the video, \nI will show you how you can create and use   a custom wake word.\nClick Create. Our Wakeword integration is now installed. In \nthe next step, we are going to install the S3   box. Make sure you haven’t installed the S-3 \nbox before in ESPHome. If you did that before,   first remove the existing S-3 Box from your ESP \nHome integration. You can do so by entering the   integration, clicking on the three dots next \nto the existing ESP, and clicking delete. Go to The esphome projects website. You’ll find \nthe link in the description of this video. Select Voice Assistant.\nSelect the ESP32-S3-Box. Select your variant of the S3-Box. \nIn my case it’s the S3-Box-3. Click connect\nNow connect your USB cable to the S3-Box. In my case I had to connect \nthe USB cable to the S3-Box itself for my PC to   recognize it. When I connected the USB cable to \nthe docking station of the S3-Box-3, the device   was not recognized. This only happened during the \ninstallation. After that, connecting the USB cable   through the docking station worked just fine.\nSelect the device that shows up in   the popup and click Connect.\nThe device will now connect  After that, it will be erased and \nflashed with the new firmware  When the installation is completed, click ‘Next’.\nNow select your Wi-Fi network and enter the Wi-Fi   password for your network.\nClick Connect  In the next step, we are going to \nconnect the S3-Box to Home Assistant. Click Add to Home Assistant.\nYou will be presented with the   my homeassistant page. Make sure that the URL \nyou see here is correct and points to your Home   Assistant instance! If this URL is not correct, \nthen edit the URL so that it points to your local   Home Assistant instance. This would normally \nbe http://homeassistant.local:8123. In my case,   it’s a different address because I use \nmultiple Home Assistant instances. Click Open Link.\nA dialog box will ask you to set up ESPHome  Click OK in that dialog box.\nSelect your Discovered S3-Box.  Click Submit.\nClick Finish.  You can also configure the S3-Box using \nthe other two options that are shown,   but it’s not needed once you have followed \nthe instructions that I’ve just shown.  Click on the devices link \nin the ESPHome integration.  If everything goes well, the ESP32-S3-Box \nis now present in the list of devices.  When you open the device, you can set some \noptions like the LCD backlight and you can   mute the microphone as well.\nNow, Let’s test the Wake   Word. It should work now.\nOkay Nabu, Office Back Off.  Okay Nabu, Office Back On.\nOkay Nabu, Office Back 10 percent.  Okay Nabu, Office Back 100 percent.\nGreat! This is working. Let’s take it one   step further by creating a custom wake word! \nI’d like to create a wakeword: “Okay Junkie”   to control my devices in my house.\nGo to the model training site. You will   find the link in the description below.\nEnter a target word. It might be that you   have to spell the word phonetically so that \nis pronounced just the way you want it.  Click Show Code.\nClick on the play button at   the top left corner of the code field.\nIf you get a warning, just ignore   that warning and click on Run anyway.\nAfter the process has finished, you can check the   pronunciation by clicking on the play button below \nthe code field. If you feel the pronunciation is   okay, go to the Runtime menu and click “Run all”.\nThis process will take about an hour,   so you can make yourself some coffee or buy me \na coffee to ensure that I can continue creating   these tutorials for you. See the links in \nthe description of the video for that.  After the training process is finished, two \nfiles are downloaded to your downloads folder.  Now you need to copy one of these two files to \nyour Home Assistant server. To be able to do that,   you have to have Samba installed in Home \nAssistant. If you want to know how to do that,   you can follow this video where I explain \nhow you can do this. The link to this   video is in the description below the video.\nWhen you’ve installed Samba, you can access your   Home Assistant server with your file explorer.\nGo to the share folder on   your Home Assistant server.\nCreate a new folder “openwakeword”.  Now copy the tflite file to \nthat openwakeword folder.  Go back to Home Assistant and click \non Settings->Voice Assistants.  You can either change the existing Nabu assistant \nthat we’ve just created, or add a new assistant.  I choose to add a new assistant, \nso we click on Add Assistant.  Give your Assistant a name. \nIn my case, it’s junkie.  Again, select the languages for your \nSpeech-to-text and text-to-speech settings.  Select Openwakeword in the Wake Word section and \nselect your new wakeword in the Wake Word field.   In my case, that is Okay Junkie.\nClick Create.  Now, we have to make sure that our \nS3-box listens to the new wake word.  Go to Settings > Devices and Services.\nClick the ESPHome integration.  Click the device link of your S3 Box.\nSelect your new Wakeword in the Assist pipeline.  And that’s it! Your ESP32-S3-Box will \nnow respond to your new wakeword!  Okay Junkie, Office Back Off.\nOkay Junkie, Office Back On.  Okay Junkie, Office Back 50 percent.\nOkay Junkie, Office Back 100 percent.  So, this is how you set up a wake word in \nHome Assistant!
