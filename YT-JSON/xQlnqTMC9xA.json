        "transcript": "let's build an entire full stack application using AI a few months ago I made a video about GPT pilot and now they have a ton of additional functionality that I'm really excited to show you not only can you build full stack applications sophisticated applications apps that would take weeks or even months to build but now the interface is much easier the agents work much better and you can actually add features to your application and the best part is completely open source and free and thanks to pythagora for sponsoring this video pythagora just changed their name from GPT pilot so the first thing I'm going to show you is how to install it and we're going to install GPT pilot the command line interface version this is the completely open source version you can use GPT 4 you can use CLA you can use any open- Source model that you want including running it locally but for today we're going to be using GPT 4 and then after that I'm going to show you the VSS code plugin which is now pythagora okay enough talk let me show you how to install it first navigate to a folder that you want everything created in so I have this one at AI projects then what we're going to do is clone the repo so get clone and then the repository URL and of course I will drop this in the description below and then hit enter to clone in the repo then you're going to CD change directory into GPT pilot like so and today we're going to be using VMV to manage our python environment I know I usually use cond cond is great as well but today we'll be using VNV so python dmvnv pilot EnV next we're going to do Source pilot dnv so the environment name we just created /bin SL activate and that's going to activate our environment then you'll know it's active because it'll say so right there in parentheses now if you're on Windows it's slightly different and this is what you're going to type instead pilot D nv/ scripts slash activate and I'm on a Mac so I don't have to do that but if you're on Windows that's what you do next we're going to install all of the requirements very simple as usual pip install dasr requirements.txt hit enter and it's done next we're going to CD into the pilot directory within gp-pilot so go ahead and do CD pilot and then hit enter now we're going to take the example environment file and rename it to just M and that is going to be our environment file so mv. mv. example space. M hit enter and that should be done now open up VSS code and make sure you open the folder gp-pilot within that there's going to be a pilot folder click that and then you're going to click the M file right there and this is where you're going to enter all your environment information now this is also where you get to choose which large language model you use and provided by by which service so if you wanted to use open AI which we'll be doing today you're going to enter your API key and your endpoint right here and I'm going to show you that in a second so go to your open AI account we're going to create a new key under the API Keys section go ahead and click it and I'm going to name it pilot YT create secret key and I'm going to copy it and yes I'm going to revoke this key before publishing the video switch back to visual studio code and you're going to enter that API key right there and for the endpoint it actually tells you the endpoint should be right here so we're just going to paste that in now we also choose the model name right here so GPT 4 Turbo preview and Max tokens and you can mess around with the max tokens I know that GPT 4 has a much larger context window than this but I'm going to leave it as is For Now open router and Azure are two other options that it gives you and I believe all you have to do to use an open source model is spin up something like oama or LM studio and then just replace this open AI endpoint with the endpoint that one of those apps gives you and since they match the completions endpoint by open AI exactly it should just be a drop and replace and you can also select your database type down here but I'm going to leave everything as default and that does mean that we're using sqlite next we need to initialize the database so Python dbor init.py and then hit enter okay and it's done and last we're just going to spin up the application now so python main. pi and this is where all of the work is going to be done so hit enter and immediately it asks for the project name now something really important to note is if you want to continue with the project that you're working on now this is the command that you use you pass it an app ID and this is the app ID right here so save that in a text file somewhere because we can always come back to it now the reason you might want to do that is because if this takes let's say an hour to go through and you don't have time to do it all in one go you can easily come back back to it and then you could also continue to iterate on the code even after you're finished so remember this ID right here so in the last video we built an oth application it was a full stack application front end and backend with a database that allows you to register for the app sign into the app and stored some of your preferences and again that was all done with GPT pilot okay so what I want to build today is a chat application so two people can chat with each other in real time and and so we'll need a few moving pieces obviously we'll need something like websockets or something similar and we need to be able to enable two different browsers to chat with each other in real time we're going to be using node.js for the framework but other than that I'm going to let GPT pilot suggest everything else so what is the project name chat app GPT pilot currently works best for web app projects using node Express and mongodb perfect you can use it with other Technologies but you may run into problems react might not work as expected so I am totally fine with this stack describe your app in as much detail as possible all right so let's try this I want a real-time chat application where two people can talk to each other through the browser in a live chat like environment each of the users should have a name and the app should store the history of the conversation you should also allow for emoji use by having an emoji selector in the input box each message in the message timeline should be accompanied by a Tim stamp of the message and who sent it and I just added messages most recently sent should be at the bottom of the message history so let's stop there let's see what it does now it's starting to help me actually refine my idea so let's start by refining your project idea do you want users to be able to create accounts or should they be able to set their name temporarily for each chat session since I already did user accounts in the last video I'm going to skip user accounts I want this to be a free-for-all and any body can message anything that they want no user accounts but users should be able to set their name temporarily should the chat be one-on-one or do you envision allowing multiple participants in the future that is a great question I think I want to allow multiple participants in the future so let's allow for multiple participants will there be any form of moderation or Administration capabilities needed for managing the chat or participants this is awesome so all stuff that I didn't really think about when devising the first prompt so I'll simply say messages can be flagged as spam by anyone and it'll show a flag next to the message so let's hit enter should there be a limit on the number of messages a user can send in a certain time frame to prevent spamming great question so yes users can send a maximum of 20 messages per minute do you require any specific Emoji set or is the standard Emoji picker sufficient standard is fine so now it's describing my app in more detail here it's defining the user experience this is actually the functional specification which is great so we have setting a username chat interface Emoji support message history and spam flagging everything that I just discussed with the AI so I love this first it's kind of like working with a product manager and then we're going to start working with developers and all of this is done hand inand with AI okay so we're going to stop there I built a full application in my previous video which I'll link down below but for now what I want to show you is the VSS code plug-in and actually being able to iterate on an existing code base and you can think of pythagora and GPT pilot as your own coding team not just a single coder they have a spec writer they have a reviewer they have a troubleshooter they have a developer and it all comes in a single package for you and they all work together to build exactly what you need and you can kind of think of it as GPT pilot is the core technology and then pythagora is built on top of GPT pilot and pythagora just allows you to do everything even easier and if you use pythagora you just need to sign up and you get 100,000 free gp4 tokens okay so open up your vs code and now we're going to iterate on an existing code base so go to your extensions tab search for pythagora and you're going to find it right here this is the logo for it sign up for an account you get 100,000 free gp4 tokens by doing that and that part is completely free and if you need more tokens you can easily plug your own chat GPT API key in there you can power it using oama if you want something local you can even use Claud but I think the best results you're going to get are currently from GPT 4 okay now on the left side we're going to see this little pythagora Tab and this is it right here and so I have an existing application it's called complex chat app and I'm going to show it to you really quickly so I have it open right here and I'm just going to click start app okay now it's started and I go to Local Host 3000 and here it is so this is a full stack chat application obviously we can iterate on the design but that is not as important as the actual logic so we go to register I'm going to register username email and password hit register okay registration successful please check your email to verify so all of this functionality was built out by pythagora all right your email has been verified successfully now we're going to log in and perfect so in this application we have a very simple chat interface so there's a bunch of chat rooms that we can join other people can join them we can chat within them we can set a password anything we want so I already have one hello let's click that join chat room and there it is so let's just test it out hi this is Matt and then we'll hit send and there it is so I have a second user amberman YT I have the first user met and that is a basic interaction that you can do with this chat application okay but now the important part I actually want to add features to this all right so back to vs code we have everything loaded up in pythagora look how much code has been written already all of this hundreds of lines of code have been written by pythagora I did not write a single line of this all we had to do was work with AI to build all of this and it already works really well but now let's add some functionality all right so we're going to add a few features let me read it in user dashboard Avatar URLs are being updated and stored to database correctly now I want to display those avatars in user dashboard below header dashboard and above new username field in dashboard it should be sized 250 x 250 pixels Avatar should be cropped in a circle second thing I want to add is a sound notification when the message is received in chat for every message in all chat rooms so I literally just type out in plain English what I want and now we're going to work with AI to add these features so I'll click submit now in my previous video a lot of you asked how much does this cost and you were specifically asking about GPT tokens right because if you're using GPT 4 this definitely costs money I built a full stack application in my previous video I think it cost about $10 or $12 and probably a lot of you are thinking wow that's kind of expensive but if you compare it to First the time saved so if you're a developer and you're building this imagine how much time you've saved hours potentially days that time is money second if you're not a developer and you actually have to hire somebody else to do this then you're saving also just a ton of money so the fact that you can build full stack applications for $10 or $15 is incredibly cheap insanely cheap all right so the first thing it is doing is coming up with a plan modify the user dashboard front end to display the user's Avatar in public dashboard. HTML add the image element and so on so it is describing in detail exactly what I told it to do now we can also see the progress right here this is Task one and it's 33% done now the developer agent jumps in and starts writing code so so implementing task number one and now we can see the code changes that the developer is actually suggesting here not only do we get the code changes but we also get explanations of what the code is doing and in real time we can actually see the code being changed so it popped up the style.css because that is the code being changed all right now we have the code monkey agent updating the existing code all good then the Code Monkey agent is reviewing the code review finished then the developer agent saves it now the Code Monkey continues and then at the bottom we have something called the human test and that means that it is asking me to go in and actually make sure everything is working properly just like we did while building the application from scratch so it tells us exactly how to do this so number one start the server using npm start now we can do that or we can simply hit start app right here then it says open up Local Host 3000 dashboard you'll be redirected to the login page if you're not logged in but we are log in great then on the dash board page observe below the dashboard header and above the new username expected result you should see an image placeholder and then last if you initially saw a broken image icon or want to test changing the Avatar use the new Avatar URL field start app let's come back to our browser I'm going to refresh the page let's go back to Rooms I'm going to go to the dashboard just like it said and there is the broken Avatar image just like it said okay so now I'm going to put a new Avatar URL in there right there I'm going to up profile okay and it actually didn't work so let's debug it with AI together all right so I entered a URL for an image to try to update the image but I don't see the image all I see is a blank space with the text avatar but the a in Avatar is partially cut off so let's see I'm going to paste it in and it'll debug it for me and now it's going to ask me some questions to help debug the issue so what browser inv version are you using to access the application so I'm going to say Google Chrome version and then paste it in the version number submit can you describe step by step what you did before noticing the issue so I went to the dashboard page entered an avatar URL in the bottom of the input box clicked update profile and then nothing happened are there any error messages in the browser's console okay so let's switch back to the browser I'm going to right click inspect then I'm going to go to console and we're going to see if there are any issues so they definitely are a bunch of issues here however I'm going to clear them I'm going to refresh the page and I do not see any errors so I'll just type no errors submit did the URL of the image you tried to set as an avatar start with HTTP or https these are great questions so it's https all right so given the description of the issue and considering there are no error messages in the browser's console it suggests that the problem might be related to how the Avatar URL is processed or displayed on the front end all right so it's going to ask me more questions now after updating the Avatar can you check if the new Avatar URL has been successfully updated in your profile details on on the server or database so we can easily do that without actually checking the database we're just going to navigate away from this page oh I have to start the app we'll log back in I went back to the dashboard page and there is the URL so it should be loading correctly and it's definitely storing in the database so yes it is being stored in the database successfully when you inspect the element where the Avatar should appear using your browser's developer tools do you see the new Avatar URL in the image source ah good question so I'm right clicking and inspect let's see if we see that Avatar so I can actually do view page source and there's the problem it's not actually linking to anything so it doesn't actually close off the IMG tag and that's the problem okay so I'm going to say no it opens an IMG tag but it doesn't include the URL and doesn't close the IMG tag anywhere here's the code and then I just paste it in the code submit is the issue persistent across different web browsers or only Google Chrome all web browsers okay so now it's debugging the issue and hopefully it's going to know what it is because I basically told it what the issue is okay now it's coming up with a plan to fix this issue updating the existing file great okay now it's sending the code for review and the review notes said it looks good saved the file updated it and now it should ask me to try it again Perfect all right so I'm going to start the app again switch back to this page refresh the page and there it is perfect exactly what I asked for there's the image I provided plus it's cropped in a circle awesome and then I'm going to just say continue and then submit so then it's continuing to build the next feature all right occasionally It'll ask you to do this so it's going to ask you to check the code make sure it's good and then if you want to make any changes do so if not you don't have to do anything and it also opens the file and highlights the line that you have to look at so please open the file and line 14 add the required input okay so let's see okay so it's asking me to check this line of code okay input required and it looks fine so I'm just going to delete that I'm not going to change anything now it's asking me to check the code again so let's see what it's asking me to do now so Step One log in you should be redirected to the dashboard page then you should see the Avatar so we already checked that but let's just check it again just in case so start app refresh and there it is and so I'm just going to click this continue button right there now it is continuing on to the next task so we're going to be integrating sound notifications for incoming chat messages in all chat rooms all right so it needs human intervention Again download or select an MP3 sound file that you wish to use as the notification sound rename this file to message notification MP3 and manually place it in the public directory of your project so I downloaded it I renamed it to message notification. MP3 and I'm saving it to the public folder back to VSS code let's continue on to see if if it needs me to do anything else and it doesn't Okay so everything working continue okay now it's sending code to review again so the reviewer agent we can see right there is reviewing the code and the review is finished and we can actually see the code being changed in real time very cool all right so it's done implementing the sound now it's asking me to check if it works again so use mpm start we could just do that by clicking start app right there open your browser log in if you have to join a global chat room or create a new one and then we're going to have have to have two browser windows open to test this so let's go ahead and do that so I'm going to register a second user M Burman yt2 register all right logging back in great so now we should have two separate browsers open two users and we're going to join the same chat room let's say this room is called room one we'll join and create the room there it is now if I refresh over here I see room one right there so I'm going to join it as the second user so let's type hello and there it is the ding worked if I go over to the other browser there it is all right so there all say hey how are you doing this is the second user and there's the ding again come back over here and there it is awesome so that is how easy it is to add new functionality to an existing application that you build with pythagora it really could not be easier the best part is you work hand inand with artificial intelligence to build out any functionality even if you're building it out from scratch if you're iterating on existing code it gives you step by step questions how to verify that it's working how to debug it it is truly seamless thanks again to pythagora for sponsoring this video find the link to pythagora in the description below I'll also link their open- source project and if you need any help at all they are super active in Discord so check them out there again I'll drop that in the description if you like this video please consider giving a like And subscribe and I'll see you in the next one"
