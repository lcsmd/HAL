        "transcript": "with open AI assistance you can build basically anything even if you aren't a programmer my name is David Onre and I'll walk you through everything step by step that way you can build your very first assistant and deploy it today now you have to go to platform. open.com here you log in with the same account as you have on CAD gbt go to assistants on the left and let's create a new one obviously you can name it whatever I'm just going to name it caps Locker instructions obviously here you can put all the crazy stuff like answer directly and concisely you can also go a bit more fun reply only in full caps model right obviously this is the llm here we have the main options but you can also click on show more models to see all the different previews and U snapshots right okay tools file search so if you have your own PDFs dogs you would enable file search and attach the files here code interpreter this is for running codes generating graphs doing math if you want your agent to be able to do any sort of calculation definitely enable codee interpreter otherwise the llm will do it and yeah that that's a disaster functions here you can upload your own function right so this is the Json schema and this is how we would format it opena has two examples get weather and get stock prices but basically you can rename this to anything you want like maybe I don't know get latest AI news right I mean this just unlocks so many things right if you want to build Advanced agents for example you want to build your own functions okay yeah resport format I should mention this so this is very useful if it's going to another agent or to some program then you probably want to enable Json object and this will just format the output it will be formatted in a nice Json temperature now this is very important you know the easy way to explain this is as creativity but it's more like Randomness CH GPT default is 0.7 right and when it goes lower the more deterministic it is or the less random now the next step is to actually test our agent but before we do that I have to show you something for the next six is everyone who joins the community gets a personalized AI strategy to Future proove yourself and your business so if you want access to the smartest people at The Cutting Edge of AI if you want complete guide on how to prepare for the Post AGI world then make sure to join it's the first link in the description and by the way the price is going up soon so if you are thinking about joining do it now so in order to test the assistant we've just built simply click on this playground icon in the top right and this will go to the open a playground with the assist loaded as the preset right so as you can see everything is on the left and we can actually change it while experimenting with it which is amazing and let's just give it a prompt right explain the core difference between open Ai and anthropic let's see what it says you know it's a open assistant so should be biased openi anthropic both focus on AI research but open AI has a longer history and has released more widely known products like like gbt while anthropic is newer and focused on AI safety okay pretty fair uh answer I would say so yeah and as you can see this uh playground has so many useful things right so we can see the tokens the input tokens and output tokens so this is 42 tokens and this is 62 tokens as you can see it looks much longer but um it matters how much it's chunked up right so and also by the way this also includes the system prompt so that's why it's 42 it's not just this this is not 42 and yeah threed ID this is what I'll show you in a bit when we get to vs code threed ID this is basically chat right inside of cgpd you have multiple chats when you create a new chat it's separate session completely uh in assistance it's called a threet so this is the unique threed ID and you can always call this in your code and buildt on top of this the the most important thing however is the assistant ID this refers to our caps Locker the system we've built and this um you can actually have multiple different assistants in your code in the same threat which is um like super useful because one maybe one assistant does research one assistant does summarization you can all have them in the same threet calling upon each other and building the messages on the top right you can also see the files where you can add the files if you want let's say it's a PDF image or whatever and if you want the assistant to have access to that just add it in here here right now if you click on logs we can actually see what's happening behind the scenes in the code so if I expand on add a message we can see the request roll user and then my prompt in the response we can see the ID of this message then the object which is Fred message created at which is the time um assistant ID is null which is interesting I guess that's U determined right here yeah yeah okay but Fred ID is determined here because this is just U the reason it's nor because it's me it's my request you know so it's not it's the user it's not assistant so yeah roll user run the threet so it sets the assistant ID and then says no additional instructions and no extra tool choice and the rest is just the response stream now you're probably thinking okay David but how do I actually deploy this in my code well I'm going to show you how to do just that here is an empty python file and we're going to start by importing time this is actually not um part of the open AI assistance but you'll see in a bit why we need that and by the way this template is inspired by pixami his video will be below in the description so then from open a we import open Ai and those are all the Imports we need just two Imports and again if you aren't the programmer simply follow along what I'm doing and all of the code will be in the community by the way so now we need to find the assistant ID so we do ID equals and we get the assistant ID and remember we get it here or we can just go back to the Builder right caps locker and it is right here as well so click to copy and we have to set it into our variable so assistance ID equals and we just paste it in super super simple next we have to uh Define the client right open AI client and here we can actually pass the API key in the Constructor or the alternative is to set it um you know as environment variable like open AI API key well actually you have to export export open AI API key equals and then you do SK blah blah blah so this is the way if you want to have it as an environment variable in your environment or if you just want to do it as a Constructor you can do it like so obviously here we have to replace it to get your API key it's super simple again you go to Plat platform. open.com and on the left you click on API keys so that is platform. open.com click on API keys and create a new secret key I'm just going to name it assistance API create Secret Key by the way I am going to revoke this before uploading the video never share your keys with anybody so click on copy let's go back to vs code and we replace this with our API key oh by the way make sure you're in the correct environment because if you're not um You probably don't have the dependencies which I should probably show you right so inside of the terminal in the environment you have to actually install open AI so you do pip install open Ai and if you are not sure whether you have it or not you can just check by doing upgrade and this will show you that you have the latest version right so this is the only thing you have to install pip install open Ai and again the way to do that is to go into the terminal create a new terminal and type it in here next we actually need to create the chat or a threet it's called a threat in the assists API but I will refer to it as a chat because everybody knows CH GPT and how chat chats work inside of it right so chat equals client. beta. threads. create and you have to follow this exact format otherwise you will get an error oh yeah by the way this is client inside of here we have to Define two things the role and the content so role user yes we are the user we are not the assistant now the content right so we can ask any question but I like this question who is the greatest businessman of all time and we'll see what um we'll see what assistant replies with it's honestly debatable but yeah this is by the way the prompt so your prompt here change this to change the prompt you get from the agent right from the assistant I keep saying Agent Man but yeah this is the formatting for the threet or chat make sure it's correct otherwise it will not work now we can actually run it by we can actually now we can actually run it by generating a new response so go run equals client beta threats run and then threat ID needs to be whatever you name this so I name it chat so chat. ID and assistant ID equals ID of our assistant and the next a simple debugging statement print run created and with the Run ID so this will keep us updated on what's Happening Now in this step you'll see why we need the time package so we have to actually wait until the run is finished or otherwise completed before we ask for the response otherwise we cannot print anything right so we can solve that with a simple while loop so while run St status is not equal to completed so uh exclamation point equal means not equal so while the status of our run is not completed we want to retrieve the current state of the run and print the status with run. status and then wait for half a second until we do it again and then this is important because we do else and this means you know if the run is completed if the status equals completed then we simply print out run completed now the last thing is to extract the message response from the threets so we do that by doing m message response name of our variable client. beta. Frets so this will access the Fred that's why we need to define the threed ID message. list and this is uh just a list of all the messages in our fret then we do another variable messages equals message response.data we just get the data from this variable and in order to print this we have to access the first uh instance of that list so every list in programming starts with zero so to get the first one we have to do index zero and then we just print it print response and this is an F string that way we can use variables inside of the string and then latest messages. content again zero to access the first index. text. value and this will just give us the text of that message so U let's see if it works and our terminal crashed I don't know why this keeps happening but for some reason avast antivirus just destroys my terminal I don't know if any of you uh have a solution for this but I would greatly appreciate it so I don't know why that keeps happening but let's try it again okay run created we have our ID okay this is interesting so as you can see we have um created run it was in progress for roughly a second and then the response is here that is subjective but many would say John de Rockefeller so who is the greatest businessman of all time John deller I think that's a pretty fair answer so now you know how to build your assistant with open eyes assistants and how to deploy it in your code now all of this code will be inside of the community I'll show you how to access it so if you go to the classroom click on David's proprietary software and code then expand upon code and it's right here openi assistance API all of the code and all the other resources are available in the community just as well as all the code from other videos and a community of people at The Cutting Edge of AI so if that sounds interesting to you make sure to join it's the first link in the description thank you for watching"
