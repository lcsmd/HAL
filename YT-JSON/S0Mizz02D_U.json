        "transcript": "so folks my goodness what I have for you in this one is wild it is a tear down of trump across mainstream media but it culminates in him being confronted interrupted cut off on Fox and called uh the the dirty liar that he is the dirty lying bord that he is and it's done in Epic fashion you've never seen something like it in mainstream media frankly because they've been far too soft on him for far too long but his recent Embrace more than usual of Putin his recent attack on America's allies his recent insanity and disrespect of his own country's military women and men that serve the country bravely think about it but beyond partisanship the people of the military should never be attacked by people wanting to run for president and it ends in something so absurdly brilliant it's going to shock you barari if this campaign becomes Trump versus Biden and if it devolves into something like old versus dangerous if Democrats say Donald Trump is dangerous Republicans say Joe Biden is old is that a race that Democrats would be confident about man that was the weakest if I've ever heard you use uh John there is no NE there's no need for the words if this is this is Joe Biden versus Donald Trump Point Blank per period so yes I think Democrats I mean we we are proverbial bed wers right so anytime somebody says something harsh about about the president or he mistakes uh the president of of Egypt for representing Mexico we just we just ring our hands I mean we go clutch our pearls we just go absolutely nuts look our candidate is the president of the United States he's old he's 80 but this 80y old man has accomplished more than any other grandfather in the history of the United States of America like he's actually performed the task well he's gotten bipartisan legislation through and the alternative is someone who's dangerous I mean let's Embrace what it is I don't know why the White House is afraid of it embrace it he's old but look he's better than the alternative and that alternative is somebody dangerous who has 91 felony counts who oh by the way who wants to talk about other people's families but he has five kids by three baby mamas I mean let's actually have this discussion on the merits and I believe we would win that election Bari sers Reena Shaw I appreciate both of your time today thank you very much what he said about NATO and sort of the door he opened for Russia and the reaction of world leaders to that that you're hearing you know poppy it is insane I mean it literally is insane in one sentence president Trump turned the entire postwar you know transatlantic security Doctrine on its head he actually after that whatever you want to call it propaganda coup for Putin uh saying that he was going to go for full defeat or only negotiate on his terms over Ukraine uh to then say that if he was President he would not just you know not come to the defense of NATO allies but would encourage Putin to do whatever the hell he likes do you know it's almost unbelievable it's an insanity to say that because that is the existential crisis that the world faces right now the postor War II you know Global Security operation is based on America and its 30 other NATO allies defending each other and coming to each other's rescue and protecting and preserving democracy and security uh you know in in the west and stoltenberg the NATO Secretary General said you know whoever is president of the United States will be you know required to keep up its uh its Article 5 and NATO commitments I mean it's just really so huge that sentence itself is so huge it is and suberg saying look that would risk American and European soldiers on the ground as well you know he chooses his words very carefully so yes than go go ahead Christian no just saying yes he does choose them very carefully and one of the things that that that zalinski has said for months is that you need to send us the weapon so that we're doing the fighting against your mortal enemy not your sons and daughters and I think that's very critical while this you know Senate Congress you know thing is stuck you know the idea of sending weapons to Ukraine is not charity it's to protect American and NATO sons and daughters and to prevent Putin having his will and and nobody doubts that if Putin wins on his terms in Ukraine that will not be the end of his appetite Christian Mur thank you from London well also this morning Elon Musk says that claims of Russia's military using and while he W when he wasn't attacking NATO or slurring his words or confusing his opponent with Barack Obama Donald Trump was launching new attacks against Nikki Haley on Saturday questioning the whereabouts of her husband major Michael Haley who is serving an active duty deployment in Africa with the South Carolina Army National Guard take a look at what Trump had to say followed by Nikki Haley's response the greatest president in my lifetime she said I will never run against him then she comes over to see me at Mar longa sir I will never run against you she brought her husband where's her husband oh he's away he's away where what happened to her husband what happened to her husband where is he he's gone he knew he knew I need to start with the fact that Donald Trump had a rally today and in that rally he mocked my husband's military service Donald if you have something to say don't say it behind my back get on a debate stage and say it to my [Applause] face I am proud of Michael's service every military spouse knows it's a family sacrifice I have long talked about the fact that we need to have mental competency test for anyone over the age of 75 Donald Trump claims that he would pass ask that maybe he would maybe he wouldn't but if you mock the service of a combat veteran you don't deserve a driver's license let alone being president of the United States major Michael Haley also responded on social media tagging Trump and several media Outlets with a graphic that reads the difference between humans and animals animals would never allow the dumbest ones to lead the pack Wow Mike Mike Barnacle how disgusting this this really reminds me so much of what he said at General Kelly which is you know that that soldiers that get killed in combat or suckers and asking General Kelly why who's who lost his on in combat why would why would anybody do that why would why would anybody like do something where they got nothing in return for it again just showing how how shallow and how horrible the man is ridiculing the Dead uh who who dead American Heroes we know that he still ridicules John McCain a dead American hero he ridiculed him for for for being in imprisoned in Hanoi for I think seven years for having the opportunity to come home even when he was being tortured so badly that he couldn't raise his arms above his head and John McCain said no no I'm not going to leave without my Band of Brothers I will not be the first out of here and Donald Trump mocked that now he's mocking Nikki Haley's husband who is an active duty service I mean there's there is a there is a a line that connects all of this and again I ask those people out there cheering when he's mocking an acting active duty service person what's wrong with you why do you support that why do you support a guy that a judge called a rapist why do you support a guy that a jury accused of or found liable for sexual abuse why do you support a guy that tells Vladimir Putin basically please inv invade Europe when I'm president of the United States I won't do anything you know Joe I might be wrong but I believe he made those comments uh to General Kelly while standing at our International Cemetery in section 68 uh which is filled with the Graves and the headstones of people who died in Iraq and Afghanistan uh look at I think what we're watching and listening to including the clip we just played of uh Donald Trump trying to make believe that Nikki Haley's husband perhaps left her when he's in Djibouti uh in East Africa serving with the United States military I believe that we're watching the ultimate whole card that the Democrats have in their hands and it is the length of the campaign that we are now witnessing N9 months of listening to this man n months of watching a man disassemble even further all right right about 10:31 back in New York here we go when she comes over to see me at Maraga sir I will never run against you she brought her husband where's her husband oh he's away he's away where what happened to her husband what happened to our husband where is he he's gone former president Trump taking making heat for those remarks about Nikki Haley's husband let's bring in presidential candidate Nikki Haley and I want to play for you Senator Rubio's response when he was asked about it this weekend how he characterized it I think they're part of the increasing nastiness of this campaign and every campaign in American politics I mean they're calling him a grumpy old man they're attacking Donald Trump trump gives as as good as he gets we know that um it's just part of these campaign Cycles unfortunately people don't like it I know that this is probably still on your mind give you a chance to respond this Monday morning it's disgusting I mean every bit of it disgusting you know to sit there and mock my husband for not being with me on the presidential Trail because he is deployed and serving our country you mock one veteran you're mocking all veterans but this is a pattern Dana he's done this over and over again whether he went and calls military members suckers whether he was at Arlington Cemetery saying what was in it for them why would they do this the problem with Trump is he's never been anywhere near a uniform he apparently had um some sort of foot reason that he says he couldn't do that but the reality is the closest he's come to Harm's Way is a golf ball hitting him on a on a golf cart these men and women sacrifice for us every day they're willing to shed blood that's the values that made this country great and anybody that excuses what he continues to say against the military is hugely mistaken because this is going to be the president of the United States we have to start doing more to help our veterans they don't get the do they deserve they don't get taken care of we've got to start watching out for them you can't do that if you've got a commander-in-chief that disrespects them those are fighting words for the military in South Carolina we love our military we fight hard for them we want to make their lives better we don't mock them and what he did is just disgusting and anybody that agrees with it or says it's okay is disgusting along with them in 2016 he did go after John McCain and question his uh service his patriotism his heroism uh you did work for him after that as the UN Ambassador did you ever bring it up with him there were many times that I told him that he was his Own Worst Enemy I mean you can look in um my last book I talk about multiple things but this is look at the pattern he goes off script from a teleprompter for two minutes and he criticizes the military mocks my husband but he also goes goes and takes the side of Putin in NATO and says that he would actually encourage Putin to invade our allies this is what you're getting we can do better than two 80-year-olds running for president we need a new generational leader that will go eight years disciplined focused without the rhetoric without the chaos but do you agree that the NATO countes should pay up their fair share Dana the NATO count should pay their fair share but let's not mistake AK the fact that when he said that he put every military member in danger he put every country in danger Russia has never invaded a NATO country that Alliance is Rock Solid it's a success story for 75 years we want them to pay more and we should do that but the last thing you do is side with a guy who kills his opponents side with a guy who has imprisoned Evan grovich because he was a journalist side with a guy who's made no beef about the fact that he wants to destroy America America and you're going to side with a thug like that what are we doing in America and that's because he went off script that's because they took him off the te he went off the teleprompter that's what you're going to get is unhinged chaos and that only makes Joe Biden sound scile or sound sane and so when you get Donald Trump Mak"
