        "transcript": "hey everyone let's get real here I'm not a developer by trade I'm into infrastructure and operation stuff like many it pro folks out there I rely on Powershell to handle deployment automation routines and all that stuff today I want to talk to you about GitHub copilot it's an AI pair coder that can seriously help your Powershell coding it'll help you write code faster and with less effort plus along the way you're likely to pick up some new skills if you're new to GitHub copilot check out my colleague's video on how you can get started with GitHub co-pilot in this video we'll explore how copilot can assist you in your Powershell coding it'll offer live coding suggestions and prompt slash comment-based suggestions it's like having a coding buddy right there by your side let's dive right into it and see what GitHub copilot can do for us as I mentioned GitHub co-pilot can assess your Powershell Coating in many ways one of the ways is live coding the other is by writing comments in your script that's GitHub hope Outlet can take context from and suggest Solutions now the context that it takes can come from the code that's already in there open files that are in vs code also from the title or the name of the file or the script that I'm writing in this case 1.1 example shutdown vm.ps1 if I go to My Line 6 and go to the end of the line it's GitHub automatically suggests that I need to set contacts and that is proper so I'm going to accept that suggestion I said enter and I will start putting a comment uh telling it that I need to list all of the M's the VMS their tags in my subscriptions that are currently powered on and store that in a variable and it does gives me suggestion however that suggestion is not quite right so I can go to the command adjust my command and then accept the rest of the suggestion now GitHub co-pilot will anticipate what my next move should be and taking context from the the file name and what's already in the script will suggest what my next iteration should be so in this case to Loop through each VM and shut them down which is exactly what I'm trying to do but instead of hitting enter I will hit Ctrl enter have a second pane in my vs code where GitHub copilot will synthesize up to 10 suggestions so I can review them and take the one that I feel is more appropriate for what I'm trying to do so I'm going to accept that suggestion it's going to insert the code and then that way I'm going to review it and edit it and change what I need to do so in this case I'm going to check what the tags are for that VM in each Loop that's proper I'll accept that suggestion and on the next line I'm also going to ask it to validate that the VM that I'm shutting down are only the VMS with the tag with the value of non-persistent and it does give me a nice suggestion and as you can see when I hover over the gray text or the GitHub copilot suggestion there's a little pop-up at the top that allows me to either go through all of the suggestions if there are more than than one to accept it or to accept just one word at a time now I don't need line 22 and 23 anymore but it automatically suggests that I if I have an if statement I should have an else statement so I've accepted that and go on now reviewing my code I can see that the stop azvm is not quite right I am missing a parameter so I'm going to go there and insert the resource Group name and the variable in that command once I've included that I can test my code so I'm going to hit F5 to execute my code and as it's running you can see that it's now shutting down vm1 now shutting down vm2 while this is going I'm going to go to my Azure portal refresh and see that I have a couple of machines that have a lifecycle tag equal persistence so these should not be touched and as this is going I'm going to go back to my script and it's continuing and now as you can tell VM live demo 1 and VM learn live Dem vm01 were not shut down because they were tagged as persistent could I have written this by myself absolutely did co-pilot help me do it in a much faster way absolutely to conclude our demo I want to talk about the shell because the shell is a powerful place and it's one that many assistant men's like me spend their days in but it can take many years of regular use to become a shell wizard to remember every commands and tricks even with a solid proficiency most of us regularly need to use the get Dash help command or scroll through pages of documentation often time we just simply end up doing a web search and hopefully finding something that is a relevant answer GitHub co-pilot CLI will allow us to avoid that search and simply ask how do I do X how do I list all the Powershell files how do I list all of the VMS in the terminal interface all you need is to use one of the three shell commands provided by GitHub copilot CLI question mark question mark git question mark and GH question mark and ask the question co-pilot will return the command and wait for you to confirm before running it well that's all I had for you today and remember there might be time when GitHub co-pilot isn't as helpful as you'd expect maybe the context is unclear or maybe your solution requires a fresh and new a unique approach however there are many situations where copilot can truly be your productive pair programmer it especially when you provide it with that extra guidance or context just remember when using copilot or writing code on your own always test it thoroughly if you found this video helpful I'd really appreciate if you could hit that like button subscribe to the channel and don't forget to smash that Bell to stay updated with new content also make sure to check out the rest of the videos in this
