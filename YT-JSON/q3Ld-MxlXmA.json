        "transcript": "llm technology is breaking the limits on what you can build you can now create software that not only makes decisions for you it can create arbitrary content on your behalf in this video I want to give you key engineering principles and techniques to help you build incredible multi-agent systems that solve problems on your behalf there's one principle in particular that once you know it will unlock a new world of Rapid engineering and productivity gains for you senior Engineers know this principle intuitively through experience and not only am I going to share this principle with you to help you architect design code and ship your work faster I'm going to show you exactly what it looks like in practice to give you a practical reference and guide on how to use this principle in this video so what is this incredible engineering principle that senior plus Engineers just kind of know by heart it's simple everything is a function so what does that mean what are the implications how does this help you ship code faster how does it help you build useful AI agents how does this principle help you build great apps and tools and less time we'll dig into that in just a moment but first let's describe what we're going to build in this series that's right we're going to start a simple multi-agent application in a classic beginning middle end 3art series we're going to talk about principles we're going to build a proof of concept and then we're going to have a production ready version and let's get into what exactly we're going to be building I've been kicking this down the road for a long time waiting for all the pieces to come together so I can share with you to accelerate your engineering while getting some concrete value out of this tool myself we're going to build a multi-agent YouTube automation metadata generator the great part about building this on the channel and sharing it with you is that you can use these principles architecture and design Philosophy for building any type of agentic content generation application if you've created YouTube content written blogs created documentation you know written peer review descriptions anything like that you know that this can be a really manual laborious process we're going to start from beginning to end and automate the entire flow of this Central manual process so after you have your video rendered you go through this long process of SEO research brainstorming ideas generating titles generating your thumbnail iterating on your thumbnail improving your description collecting the resources putting your hashtag together all to you know formalize that into a final review so that you can upload your video this is really applicable to any process where you have a core asset that's been generated think about you know code think about a PR think about a Blog think about an announcement post anything like that where you have a core asset and then you have surrounding metadata that takes a decent chunk of time but is Mission critical to shipping your core asset so we're going to take this entire process and build a multi-agent system that automates the entire process for us so all we have is our rendered video we'll then build out a simple CLI application at least to start then we can build it into a UI that will take that rendered video it'll generate all the metadata that we need and then it'll create just a few files that we can quickly upload and have the process fully automated removing all of these Center steps for us so let's talk about principles to help us build multi-agent applications like this in video two and three of this series we're going to dive deeper into the details of how exactly will do each one of these steps in this video I want to set up some of the core principles you can use to build software in general but more specifically a gentic software software that's fueled by llms software that utilizes multi-agent systems that are being built right now with the new incredible llm technology at your disposal so let's take a look at three key engineering principles we can apply including this interesting idea of everything is a function that we can apply to building multi-agent applications looking at this YouTube automation tool as a example we can work through so principle one use the right tool for the job in this case use the right agent for the job right so let's talk about this a little bit identify the problem you're trying to solve break your problem into tiny problems in the example of our metadata generator we have this whole top level problem of create YouTube metadata right and so there are actually several steps in there right we have the generation of the title the thumbnail the description right break those down to Tiny Steps whatever your big level process is whatever your big problem is it's not a big problem it's three or four or five small ones this makes it a lot more digestible then decide if you need an agent if you need to code or if you need manual input to make this happen and when you're building these out always start from the top to the bottom if you can use an agent to do it use an agent if you need to code write the code if you need manual input okay then do it manually you want to be automating as much as you can so this brings up a really important question that I think a lot of us are still working through how do you know which one to choose how do you know when you can use an LM to solve a problem in front of you so when to use an AI agent this is kind of reformulating the question use the best tool for the job in a different way right when do you use this tool when do we use this incredible tool that we've been given this LM technology so a framework I've been using that I think will be really helpful for you is follow crud in order this is something that I've been utilizing in talk to your database a text to SQL to results application that just went Live this past week really excited about that I'm going to leave that in the description if you're interested in writing less SQL and getting more results out of your database that's going to be in the description for you this principle of following crud in order so what do I mean by that you want your agents to be doing these things over these things so you want them to be creating and reading over updating and deleting let's dig into this a little more agents are great at creating and reading data at creating and reading information agents are not great at updating and deleting data it's a lot riskier there's a lot more complexity in updating something it requires a lot more context a lot more knowledge a lot more awareness and frankly llms are not there even some of the best Topline ones obviously I'm talking about gpts right gpt3 and gbt 4 Turbo in the eyes of our YouTube transcription multi-agent system we have this transcribe YouTube video that's just going to be raw code there's no reason to have an agent transcribe a video for you then we're going to read the transcription in each one of our prompts and then we're going to create metadata from that right we're going to be creating thumbnails we're going to be creating titles we're going to be creating the description right and this Falls in those two really great cases in our crud system that llms are really great at you can always use this as a quick reference when do I use an llm when do I use an AI agent am I creating am I reading that should be the first thing you ask yourself am I creating and am I reading if you're updating and deleting it's going to be a bit more complex there's going to be a bit more going on llms are great at creating new information creating new data and they're great at reading existing data so that's framework number one a couple more useful tips you want to be be looking at lower midsize Stakes you want to be looking at repetitive tasks right it's like every time you upload a video every time you post a blog every time you PR your code whatever it might be you know these repetitive tasks can definitely be automated away via llm technology why because they have clear inputs and outputs so I hope that's sounding familiar and I hope that Rings a little bell here to something we're going to be talking about in just a second next when do you use an llm when you understand the problem well I've talked about this before in the 2024 predictions video I think the biggest trap for newbies and people stepping into new domains with the help of gpts and chat GPT is that they don't actually know what they're looking for and how can you create a solution when you don't know the problem well right there's an inconsistency there so you want to understand the problem well if you don't understand the problem well you shouldn't be asking someone or something right the llm the agents to solve it for you because you won't even know how to prompt you won't know how to ask the question right you won't know how to direct your agent to solve the problem for you you should probably just code it yourself and do it manually so you can better understand the problem and then maybe after that turn to an llm to automate it use AI agents to solve problems you understand well fast if you're enjoying this so far if this makes sense so far definitely hit the like hit the sub it helps other creators Builders and Engineers just like you find this content get value out of it so that they can build their next thing definitely takes some time for me to formulate all these ideas to turn it into concrete content that you can consume quickly and move on with your day so let's move on to one of the key core principles we discussed in the beginning everything is a function let's break this down this is a really deep State idea in engineering once you hear it once you understand it it kind of changes the way that you think about software llms take in prompts and return responses right scripts take in CLI arguments and produce outputs right apis take in parameters and return data you have function parameters and you have function return values right you have your prams and you have your return you can see where this is going right all code is effectively a pipeline of functions that take in inputs and produce outputs okay let's just like really try to dig into this idea let's try to internalize this idea once you understand this you can design and engineer better tools and applications much faster much better you can understand where things might go wrong everything is a function let's keep digging into this right every problem can be broken down into a series of functions with discrete inputs and outputs that can be tested and chained together These Chains you build make up the solution to your problem so if you want to build great Solutions you need to understand and properly design your inputs and outputs of the functions you're using and chaining together here's the big kicker llms are just another function in your pipeline llms are just another piece in your solution if you design that their input well you'll get a great output right let's look at a concise example Through The Eyes of our YouTube metadata generator system the top level problem can be defined as this function the input is a video write a path to a video I'll have a fully rendered video into a directory or my desktop wherever it might be it's going to return metadata so all we have in this function is whatever steps you need to take to you know use your llms to generate the metad data given the video right just like in principle one use the right tool for the job how do you find the tool you take your problem and you break it down and then you say how can I fix this one tiny thing let's break it down now we have a transcribe function and so what this does is important but what's more important is the input and the output so we have transcribe so we'll transcribe the video we'll get a string and then once we have our transcription we'll be able to generate the description right so then that Returns the string right maybe we pass in the title maybe we have that available and what does that that do now we can given the description and we probably want to pass the title in here as well right but given this additional information we can now chain that together and generate our image generate thumbnail will take a description probably a title as well and now it'll generate an image okay so think about your llms as you would any function you can test them you can chain them you can break them down into smaller functions most importantly you can design them to take in specific inputs and produce specific outputs to solve your problem why because everything is a function functions have parameters they take inputs and functions have return values they produce outputs principle three great questions yield great results as you're building out your multi-agent systems and your agentic applications and even just your raw software just keep asking good questions even if they seem dumb right what am I trying to solve what is the right way to use this tool what is the right prompt what's the best way to do this and every question you come up with just throw your best guess answer at it a lot of engineering and product building is you know there are lots of solved problems but eventually and this is where things get interesting you're going to run into something that you just aren't sure about and that's when it's really important to formulate a good question so that you can create a great result from that right or at least a result that you can iterate with so you know how will you know when your problem solved what happens if something goes wrong do you have good failure mechanisms and how do you monitor the solution right if you're building out these agentic applications you're going to want to know and Define questions like this for a multi-agent YouTube metadata generator we know when the problem's solved when we can you know type in our CLI app or whatever the application is on the other end of it we get a title we get an image and we get a completed description right that's how we know when it's complete you want to be creating answers to your questions because that will give you solid results so you know with these principles you can take your principles apply them create a proof of concept and then after that create a production and that's exactly how we're going to formulate these three videos this video is all about the principles we're going to use to build our multi-agent system in the next video we're going to show off the proof of concept and then we're going to productionize it we're going to share it with the world you'll be able to download this you'll be able to use it just to even test it out right even if you don't generate YouTube content you'll be able to look at the code and check this out so with these principles we can start moving forward right right no plan is perfect because there's bound to be unknown challenges that arrive during development but those who plan the future tend to create it and then once you have that you can create your first version right principles allow you to get to your first version with the fundamental truth of what you're trying to build right what's the problem you're really trying to solve how can you use llms to help you get to that point keep your principles close throughout development especially in that first version once you have your first version you can iterate to success you'll be able to unlock the awesome value that llms are giving us the principles really give you a tool set to build the first version right so you know on the channel we're going to build out this multi-agent YouTube metadata generator in the next video we're going to show off V1 we're going to break down how we utilize these principles and then we're going to get a full productionize version now we're going to talk about the good the bad we're going to you know use this channel we're going to use these videos as a learning grounds for building out this great technology I'm really excited to put a lot of the things I'm learning right now from building talk to database I'm actively working on that we have new features coming every single week I'm really excited to ship those for everyone writing SQL that wants to save a bunch of time but we're taking that we're taking all these ideas we're pushing them further here we're going to automate YouTube metadata generation we're going to do that by building a really cool CLI application that does it all for us thanks for watching stay focused keep building and I'll see you in the next one with a proof of concept"
