        "transcript": "I came around the B on my fourth lap and a Ford Explorer was coming right at me what if playing your life safe is actually more dangerous than taking risks I was like he sees me right and boom he hits me today's guest is Michael O'Brien Michael ended up Surviving and today he calls it his last bad day our world just got tipped upside down everything's neutral until you label it we all get to wake up every day and be very intentional about how we're showing up in the world what are you putting out there you're just a little dot on this Big Blue Marble traveling through space and the world's always going to be uncertain and so how do we want to dance with [Music] it today's episode is brought to you by the awesome organizations that make this show [Music] possible well I'm really happy to have you here um been looking forward to this for for a long time we met in Italy you were one of the people who showed up at is salana for our Retreat uh and as is our our tradition at those events uh uh when everyone arrives at the first evening meal we kind of go around and everybody introduces themselves and when it came to you you got up and kind of delivered a keynote like you just told this unbelievable story like I didn't know you and I wasn't familiar with your story uh and I was so moved by not only what you shared and the hardships that you've endured and and kind of what you've gone through and how you've leveraged that to transition your life but on top of that your facility for telling that story and kind of understanding what's Salient about it and impactful for people that hear it I thought well this guy not only has a great story he knows how to tell it well he knows what's important about it and how it can impact other people and that was what planted the seed that I thought you might be a good guest on the show so I'm really happy to have you here today well thanks for having me that's really kind of you to say and clearly very generous for you to have me here cuz I know what about 60 people sit in this chair each year and so there's been some really wonderful people as I've listened over the years sitting in this chair and I feel yeah I feel a lot of honor and gratitude for being here W so thank you I feel honored to have your attention here today as well it's going to be fun we're going to have a good conversation yeah and I think look you know it's fun to sit down and talk to really fancy people that everybody knows but I think everybody has a story and certain people people know how to tell their story well and you're one of those people perhaps it's not entirely fair but I would put you more into the every man camp of guests that have appeared on the show and I think there's something about that that is important to hold on to as a tradition because we've always had from time to time certain people who nobody's ever heard of but who actually have a lot of important things to share and I think there's something more inherently relatable about that like when you hear somebody who's a so much it can be inspirational but it's hard to emotionally connect with that and you know find a way to translate whatever they're sharing into your own life and I think there is a lot of relatability in your story and to the point of you being an every man you've also done extraordinary things so I wouldn't you know it's like I'm not trying to malign you in that regard either well rich like I will ease any worry I fully own that every man part of my journey also acknowledge that we've been able to do some really cool things but I love the every man's story I I do believe that your story is in my story and my story is in your story and we're all in everyone else's story I think that even the people that have really have made it to the tip of the spear I think there's still some things that are really relatable about their story before they really hit it big like the grind before they hit it big and so I love sharing the story because I think it it can be really relatable to a whole bunch of people who are just trying to figure it out they want to be a good partner a good parent if they happen to be parents and they're trying to figure out this thing this beautiful thing that we all have called life this great gift and they're trying to find meaning to it and become who they want to become and also sort of unbe what they were taught they had to be when they were younger well your story pivots around a particular event that you call your last bad day so let's paint the picture of what your life was like prior to your last bad day before we kind of dive deep into that sure thing so I grew up in Rochester New York so beautiful Upstate one of two kids uh my parents never went to college so School wasn't really emphasized Sports was so I thought the way to my dad's heart was through Sports whatever sport I was playing I was going to be the next Pro when I was growing up I wanted to be short stop for the Toronto Blue Jays so right from there the story gets a little wonky because what kid in America grows up to be shortstop for Canadians baseball team right so we never really paid any attention to college except except my older cousin went off to college being the first one so my parents never really Sav for college but I was determined to find my way and I really didn't know what that was again my dad and my mom love them dearly but they never really stressed school so and I was a student that teachers could easily forget about because I wasn't getting straight A's I wasn't going into an Ivy League or a pseudo ivy league I wasn't that smart from an academic perspective as far as grades but I wasn't getting in trouble so I wasn't that D student or F student getting detention you're just in the middle I'm invisible the invisible kid I'm not really speaking up in class I'm getting B's and C's and that was life and I would dream about playing Major League Baseball or really the big sport the big sport in our house was bowling really oh yeah I'm a huge like Rich when I first when we were kids there was the pro bowling league on TV and all of that every Saturday I would watch that when I got my Commodore 64 computer my first basic program was to compute my bowling average wow that's how geeky we're GNA get today so but my dad was a Big Bowler I was really good I was 16 I had like 190 average I thought like this is something right it's Rochester right so you go bowling right most people go out Friday night and go disco bowling now and all that J but I was really serious I had my own shirts my own shoes I had three bowling balls it was big time in our for was it was legit yeah totally legit and I quit that at 16 that was probably My First Act of Def iance cuz I was a rule follower I wanted to be the good kid mhm why' you quit because I came home my grandmother passed away from lung cancer and when I was younger my parents smoked it was like the worst habit I would hold my breath in the car I came home one Saturday from doing our league tournament stuff and I wed of cigarettes like my whole body was smelled like an ashtray and I was about 16 and I was like this can't be good like breathing in this air it can't be healthy and I told my dad I was quitting I was like I'm not doing this anymore I'm done with bowling at that time too I started to watch the tour def France on CBS Sports they had like a 10 15 minute clip and I thought wow this sport because I also love riding my bike I still remember the day I came off of training wheels for the first time I thought oh wow I can go anywhere on this bike so I started watching the tour and the John Tesh music and the whole thing and I was like this is really romantic like here hardcore Europeans doing this fringy Sport and I started to fall in love with that and I fell out of love for bowling and you started riding your bike I mean there weren't our kind of age group growing up there wasn't a lot of people doing that at the time no I it was breaking away the movie and you know maybe that that was even like pre Greg Lamont or yeah so breaking away came out a few years later Greg came onto the scene then there was the 80 Olympics in La so those two big things Greg coming up into the pro ranks and really in a lot of ways revolutionizing how cycling looked as far as contracts and sponsorships and all that jazz I really think he doesn't get as much credit as he deserves and the Olympics hit and so we did fairly well the US did in the Olympics or actually the 84 games not the 80 games I was already in it I was riding my bike I was training I was starting to race I graduated high school in ' 85 and then came the whole idea of college so my parents wanted me to stay local like my older cousin and it took me a year yearr to convince them this is my other Act of like expressing my voice for the first time I told them I have to get out of Rochester I don't care where I go but I have to get out of this place and I went to school in Virginia James Madison and that was the beginning of me expressing my voice and trying to find out who I was and that expiration and I got into cycling there and help establish the cycling team down there and that was the early day days of Collegiate cycling now Collegiate cycling looks pretty professional back then it was a rag tag bunch of guys and gals trying to figure it out but that was the start and I started riding and racing and spending my Summers riding and racing up and down the east coast and we got to my graduation I moved to DC because that's what you do because I had student loans to pay off obviously not as big as some of the student loans that kids have to pay off today and I got my first gig and then I took a break from cycling and fell into love with running and I did the Marine Corps marathon and eventually the Boston Marathon and along the way while we were in DC I met my wife in the Washington City paper which you probably are aware of in a personal ad and we had our first daughter who as we sit here today turns 26 today right yeah so life begins really in in Washington DC and it's a sales career right sales career my mom was a nurse she worked 11:00 p.m. to 7 a.m. so she could be with us during the day and my dad was in sales and I really didn't know what I wanted to do but I was like okay that seemed like a good gig that's what Dad did he seemed to be able to provide for us we were pretty hardcore middle class you know I was wearing Pony sneakers while all the other fancy kids had Nikes and Adidas so we would shop at the outlet stores while other kids would have name brand merchandise and the whole thing so I started as a sales rep and that first in copers and then uh eventually into Healthcare so it sounds like beneath the surface there's a little bit of ddy issues kind of at play here like wanting to impress your Dad or this idea that love was transactional and related very much to what you could achieve in the world whether it was through sports or through career but you kind of peering up at your dad seeking approval in that way is that a fair estimate I think it's a very yeah very fair estimate I'll give you a little bit more of the timeline my parents will celebrate my mom has passed but if she was around come next year next April they'll celebrate 57 years of marriage in September of next year year I will turn 57 mhm so obviously you do the math yeah Mom was pregnant with me when they got married MH so there was a big part of me growing up wondering did they want me were they forced into getting married and I grew up in a very Catholic Family so you know uh Choice wasn't a choice back then very Catholic like we're going to figure this out mhm the under Bell of like who I was and doubt or that self-narrative was like was I really wanted that whole thing and I and I thought like and then you had to prove your worth then I have to prove my Worth right that is a thread that's part of my life that I've been you know working through and we'll get to the actual accident and the whole thing that allowed me to work on that even deeper but a big part of life was was I wanted and how can I prove that I mattered that I was like worth keeping if you will and I thought well if I did really well in sports which was the foundation of my conversations with my dad then that's the ticket that's how I'm going to establish my worth it wasn't academically because Dad didn't really care too much but he could talk about the New York Yankees until the cows came home and short of you you becoming a professional shortstop the next best thing was to find yourself in a situation where there's an upward trajectory career-wise right where you could climb a certain ladder and really engage with that honic treadmill prove you know I'm going to prove myself Rich this is something I relate to deeply like I'm asking you all this because this is my own therapeutic session yeah this is you know I got caught into the night life of DC that you know well like the same bars that you used to hit I hit and I thought okay this is it like I really thought here's the script you go to college you graduate you get a gig you meet someone you marry to someone you have a couple kids and you know you work your way up the corporate ladder you buy a Subaru and maybe you trade that Subaru in for something nicer and you get a really nice title and on the surface if LinkedIn was a thing back then things looked pretty good I I had a pretty great career and we had a happy family but deep down inside as I like to say I was shoving a whole bunch of rocks in my backpack like oh that thing that stressor that worry that insecurity that was just a pebble a rock I just put it in the backpack and I would just like put it on and I would walk through life with my backpack and it felt normal right it was like well that's life right they pay you money your salary because the job's stressful and get over yourself and just suck it up and just put another rock in your backpack and that's how I was living I would privately compare myself to everyone else like you know this is what we do like well what do I have and this was before again social media so like well what's their title how' they get promoted how much money are they making what size is their house like all that stuff I was processing very privately cuz I didn't want anyone to know that that was going on up in the head cuz that just seemed crazy but that's what's going on in all of our heads we're like exactly the same age so I relate to that deeply I mean there was no tools or priority around any kind of internal excavation it's like this is what you do and the inquiry ends there right and whatever happiness you lack is always going to be found through the next purchase or the next promotion or you know when you're upleveling like it's always on the horizon like just Out Of Reach yeah but always seemingly within grasp you know if you just continue to apply yourself well the thing is sometimes you catch it right you catch the promotion you buy the new car the good thing happens you're like see all right mhm you just you got to catch it again so you get promoted but then then you learn 3 days into the job oh this is a harder job like someone told me I have less free time now yeah this this adage uh next level like new Devils right so it's like it's like yes I got promoted and there's the big email that goes out and everyone's like awesome job that's fantastic and you're like yes look at me look how great I am I just got promoted at such a young age and then you're like a snap this job m sucks I'm not happy and then you start looking for another job CU you're like well it's it's all the people around me like it's the environment it's not me it's like it's this company so we got to find a new job but you're still not unpacking any of the rocks in your backpack and you're just carrying that around with you and there's no questioning of the game itself there's no option of like getting off the treadmill and trying to figure out a new game oh no I tried a couple times to say what are we doing here folks like and everyone looked at me like what are you what are you talking about this is blasphemy you do not this is the system and I'm like but the system doesn't seem all that great for really any of us because we're all going through this right like or am I just the crazy one and people would just you know bow their heads and no one would want to say anything and I'm like what is what is going on like this script stinks but here's what I thought like well this is the script you got Michael like keep in mind maybe they didn't want you anyway right the there's like a light dusting of impostor syndrome at play here of course definitely like someone's going to find out like like they're going to find out that you just have to be out running it all the time yep I just have to go faster I have to be 10 minutes in front of you mhm what's that saying like you don't have to be the fastest antalope you just have to be faster than the slowest one like that was it like just don't be the last one on the sales quota leaderboard just be in front of someone try to go faster do something physically that makes you feel alive for me that's what sport was was like okay I feel alive I feel I feel comfortable it was also a moment of quiet and silence I didn't realize how contemp ative it was back then but I was like all right this is my happy place like I can be here and we were also trying to juggle then moving from DC up to New Jersey young family balancing everything like relocation is not an easy feat for really most people so now we're trying to figure this all out and it was wickedly stressful mhm but it was stressful for for all of us so my feeling was let me see what I can do to relieve the stress of everyone around me and I'll just put this rock in my backpack and I'll deal with it later so that speaks to also uh proclivity for people pleasing oh yes yes yeah I would like you know I like to say who doesn't love to make people feel happy but it was coming at a cost that I I really didn't know how to offer myself self-compassion we weren't taught that you know I can only imagine you weren't taught that as a young boy like CU we are of the same age we weren't taught that it was all right dust yourself off like you know put your big boy pants on and go out and do it sure right so it wasn't we weren't talking about openness we weren't talking about owning your scars and your blemishes we had yet to meet Berne Brown like like we were like put your mask on put your body armor on and go out there and get it done yeah and shut the [ __ ] up like what do you have to complain about you have a good job you got a nice family you can pay your bills everything's taken care of life is good and you know if you're going to gripe about it you're being sort of indulgent aren't you you're being a whiny little baby like just get out there and and do your job you know provide for your family yeah I had no knowledge of really any tools except when I was a in my early days as a sales rep I would put zigg Ziggler cassette tapes in the car and ride around and listen to Zig he planted a bunch of seeds I believe that I pulled through when I went through my recovery and maybe there was some Tony Robbins cassette tapes because that's all we had back then were cassette tapes and that was really it that I knew of in terms of personal growth and I hate this term self-help that that whole genre that was it I was listening to Jim Rome Tony Robbins and Zig Ziggler Zig Ziggler you know obviously was you know sort of the precursor to Seth Goden very influential on Seth and sort of a Tony Robbins for people who are in sales and marketing yeah he had all these little Southern mannerisms and sayings and you know he was a meme before there was a meme like you could take a quote of zigs and put it on a LinkedIn post or tweet it out if it was the thing back then it was like oh yeah okay I have the solution here's the ticket M here's the way you can alter your script but then reality set in it was like it it's not so easy you know life can't be boiled down to just a little sound bite it's not that simple it's not that binary it's complicated we're messy you know that's what life is and I really just wanted the good parts of life like most people I really didn't want to deal with all the garbage so again I would try to push that away and just focus in on the the happy stuff MH but I was really denying the fullness of of this thing called life right so you relocate to ten ofly you're in this new job you are on an upwardly mobile trajectory and you find yourself in New Mexico on a business trip you're 33 years old you're back on the bike cycling's a big thing so you bring your bike with you yeah I actually bring my buddy's bike so Derek McGinty who is a guy I met down in DC he had a bike Friday and I was like C your bike because I'm going to go out to New Mexico and I have this goal I still have it of riding my bike in all of the 50 states and so New Mexico was not conquered yet so it was one of those week-long Retreats that are so common in corporate life you fly out on Monday you fly back on Friday they give you a half a day to go golfing and I was like screw golfing like cycling is the new golf doesn't anyone know that so I'm going to bring my bike out and it was a new property out in the middle of nowhere New Mexico in between Santa Fe and Albuquerque subsequently they built a Cino there and all that jazz and a golf course so I brought my bike out and I was like all right I'm going to get some miles in because I had a bike race in the next town over that Sunday and it was going to be my first race back after we had our second daughter I was like all right this is we're going to do this we're going to get back into competitive cycling I wasn't really in great shape I probably would have gotten dropped early on if I did the race and I mapped out this really cool loop it was out the main part of the hotel and up the main drag two miles was going to do 10 laps 20 miles and then go into the team building all the PowerPoint and Trust Falls and flip charting and all that all that [ __ ] that we do and we think it's actually building the team but it's really not maybe we'll put a pin in that for later and I came around the bend on my fourth lap and a Ford Explorer was coming right at me and I just looked up and I I really I was like this does not compute like what is he doing here why is he in my Lane he must see me he sees me right see he's going to move he's going to move he sees me and then as you can imagine everything slows down and boom he hits me police estimate he was going about 40 I didn't have any time to really move out of the way and to this day I still remember the sound I made when I hit his front grill and then that flipped me around and into his windshield and blew a hole through the windshield and then I remember hearing the Screech of his breakes and then I made a thud and I came to the asphalt below when he finally came to a stop he was basically still in my Lane so I often wonder if he even realized he had hit me I think he did cuz the glass from the windshield flew into his face well he had to have realized after he hit you yeah but he didn't really how he was you know not seeing you and how he ended up in your lane to begin with is that a a mystery that's been solved no it's a mystery that will probably never be solved he said he was avoiding a coyote but being a Suburban kid if there was a coyote out there in the middle of New Mexico I would have hight tailed it back into the hotel pretty quickly so I didn't see any Wildlife he just he was coming in to work he worked at the hotel he probably wasn't expecting a cyclist on the road it was relatively again new property I probably was the first cyclist riding that stretch of road at that hour you know the sun was coming up and he probably in a million years never thought there would be a cyclist there so let me just cut the Apex as I go into work because I'm running late M and I'm there right it's like boom timing I wake up five minutes later Heck if I wake up a minute later or go a minute earlier almost like the movie sliding doors with gwenneth calro it doesn't happen then so but it happens I regain Consciousness I'm surrounded by EMT police fire ambulance they brought the state trooper in to pronounce me dead at the scene of the accident because they didn't think I was going to make it and I was trying to get my bearings I didn't have any ID on me at the time so I was trauma patient mango until my wife ided me and they just kept on saying like who are you like you know I kept on telling him them who I was at least I thought it was clear but it probably wasn't I did crack a joke because I learned growing up the way to cut tension when it gets uncomfortable is do a little humor so I was like hey how's my bike like any good cycl like any good cyclist right it's a question that every cyclist knows they're like your bike's fine just try to breathe and there I was rich I was surrounded by people but I felt incredibly lonely I was like this this can't be happening like this isn't the script like bad things happen to other people I'm the person that gives their thoughts and prayers to other people when bad things happen to other people but nothing bad had ever happened to me and there I was lying on the asphalt they called the helicopter to bring me to Albuquerque I tried to convince them that I didn't need to go in the helicopter because I was scared of flying back then I was like do we really need to go in the helicopter because that seems like really dangerous I still had some some of my bearings straight and they're like yeah we need to get you to Albuquerque right away and when they put me on the Medevac I just I made a commitment I was like all right whoever's listening it was a complete bargain that I had no idea how to actually pull through but I goes if if anyone's listening I promise if I live because that was definitely in question based on the energy of the scene I will live better I'll stop chasing happiness because that was my Chase like the hamster wheel I was like I'll do better like thanks for the warning but like I will do better and I remember every minute of the 19 minutes that I took to get to Albuquerque I landed on the roof they brought me down into the trauma center there were about 20 people in the trauma room I met my surgeon and I was like pleasure to meet you under the circumstances and then the next thing I know I was out and I was out for about 4 days in change and my wife flew out with our youngest and when they told her that things were like bad but you got to come out she didn't think they were that bad in fact what she said at first like can you patch him up and just fly him home he's crashed before but they're like no you really have to come out and so she landed and as she's flying out every time she would check in with the hospital I was still in the trauma center MH and she was like well this is weird well at first she thought well probably someone else who's been injured worse than Michael got bumped in front of him so this is no big deal but when she landed and got to the hospital I was still in the trauma room and at that point in time things got really real and she said I don't care who comes out of that room next but I need to know what's happening with my husband and the vascular surgeon came out and said your husband's been in a very bad accident we're doing the best we can the next 72 hours are going to be critical and that's when it really yeah became real for her she was like oh like we might lose him m yeah and I think at some point Didn't the surgeon tell your wife listen had he been a couple years older or not in as good of shape uh he most certainly would have died yeah they told her later if your husband had been 10 years old or or Not In Shape he would have never made it to the hospital because I lost so much blood when the left femur shattered it lacerated the femal artery so I was bleeding out and we didn't really know it until we got there and they started trying to fix me up and they didn't really complete all my fractures in that first surgery they really just tried to fix the left femur and fix the femoral tear so I have a fem pop bypass in my left leg and then the right leg and everything else they waited for like later to address so here we are like married seven years our oldest is three and A2 our youngest is 7 months old and our world just got tipped upside down and it's a story that a lot of families deal with every day

uh I will no longer Chase happiness is a very interesting bargain it's Unique because I think most people would say if I live I promise I'll be a good person or I will you know stop doing whatever bad thing I've been doing or you know what I mean like but there's something very specific about the prompt of I will no longer Chase happiness like how did you have the awareness to hone in on that of all things that you could be thinking about in that limal space between life and death well first off I'm not sure if I was talking to God I was just talking to whoever was listening the higher the higher like the higher power a lot of people after the accident shared with me man God was looking out for you I was like really like where was she they he right before impact because I was I was pretty angry at the higher power for letting this happen to begin with going back to Ziggler he would talk about living a like a be have a do life or do have B like basically we're we're doing all this work to have stuff and then once you have the stuff you can actually be who you want to be so that phrase from zigg was a seed that was planted so I knew I think deep down inside I was living life that way I was working really hard putting in the hours so I could have stuff I could have status my big chase was I want a voice that matters because again going back to Childhood I'm not sure if my my voice matters I'm not sure if I'm really wanted again grew up in a loving family my parents were really kind but still had that doubt and so I knew I was chasing after it cuz once I got something I felt good for a bit and then vanished so there was something in that whole chasing and I do think the tapes I was listening to from zigg was a seed that was planted on that specific thing so I was calling out like Whoever has power around here anyone like if I stop chasing happiness if I live I'll stop I'll do better I'll try to be in the moment and I had no idea how I was going to do that because the only thing I knew was the chase for more stuff and the whole do more be more type of thing MH for a lot of people who suffer some kind of hardship or reach a pain point or some kind of Ute extreme experience like that it's of course not uncommon for some version of you know that kind of bargain making you know to occur uh but there's a half-life on that the human brain has a way of snapping back and just going back to what's normal once the severity of the situation passes but you've held that promise you know and we're human I'm sure you haven't done it perfectly or whatever but like this to this day has persisted as your work rais on Detra like this is what drives you absolutely and initially and this is a bit of the thread from childhood initially in my recovery what I wanted to do was to prove that my life was worth saving that day so I was like I'm going to make good on this promise because I have so much gratitude for everyone who showed up that day they didn't ask me who I voted for they didn't ask me what type of people I love they didn't ask me anything about where I lived or how much money I made granted I'm a white dude and that gave me some privilege right from the rip because we all have bias but they showed up and they were on their game and if they weren't I don't survive or maybe I Come Away with injuries that don't allow me to recover in the way that I have so I was like wow like man they showed up they really showed up and the early phases of my recovery was like all right now I'm going to prove that like my life was worth saving it was a transactional thing I've come to realize that my life was worth saving period full stop because all of our lives are worth saving but in the early days the real fuel for this was I'm going to prove that I matter I'm like you did a good thing and I'm going to show you you did a good thing mhm and I haven't been perfect there have been times where I get caught in the chase when I left my corporate life and I started my life as an entrepreneur it's easy to get caught into this whole new world like oh this is what you need to do and this you should do this and not that and you got to get back on it and you start comparing yourself to other people who are out there and then I would check myself and i' come back right why isn't pause breathe uh reflect like on par with calm or like you know like all of that kind of I deserve a seat at the table like what's that about like and it's just like that doesn't seem fair and like all that MH I am human I have moments where I go back to that Groove from when I was younger I'm better at knowing when I feel it generally in my body be like okay that's that's what's happening you come back home you come back to your Center but yeah I've had all that or when I got to the Executive Suite in my career and I'm like all right now what because I had blown past my aspirational job in my corporate life and I really didn't go after the executive role until people said you need to do this role I'm like really I'm happy I got the job that I wanted to get coming coming out of college I'm this is good like I made it they're like no no you got to go to the next one I'm like ah okay will it make people happy yeah you you got to do it for our culture you got to go after this job I'm like but I don't want to and they were like you really need to and I was like okay and I'm glad I did it I learned a whole bunch about ex I could of leadership and it's put me in a beautiful position today but yeah I've Had My Moments I still have my moments where I get caught up in all the things that make us human and instead of putting a rock in my backpack now I sit with it I reflect on it I deal with it in a healthier way than when I did it before so my backpack is really light today because I don't have so many rocks in it mhm in the aftermath of the accident just paint the picture of the State of the Union like what were your injuries and what was that recovery like for you it was a mess that was I felt Rich every type of pain you can feel chronic pain sharp acute pain a stinging pain like you can name a sensation related to pain and I think I've felt it through this whole thing and when I came out of the ICU they started telling me about all right here's what happened driver had a revoke license I'm like oh great so he shouldn't have been driving that day y he shouldn't have been driving I'm like well this is a fine hello how do you do so here I am I'm all laid up in the hospital when it gets dark it gets really lonely it's just you and beeping machines and I'm like why' this happen to me I would cry a ton my parents came out and I knew I knew I was a mess when my parents came out cuz my mom did not want to fly but the early days of the recovery I felt like my whole sense of dignity was stripped away cuz here you are so I'm in the ICU for 4 days in change I'm on a whole bunch of different meds they got pain meds dripping through me in an IV and my body shutting down so big thing they want you to do is all right have you had a bow movement so here I am a 33y old man naked on top of a bed pan I can't move around my leg's in traction I can't really deal with my right shoulder because that's broken because my right leg was broken in multiple spots the right shoulder was fractured the left femur was blown apart have a f poop bypass I have nerve damage throughout my left leg I can't really feel my my toes I have a toe drop in my left foot so there's a lot going on in the bottom of my foot though would feel like fireworks going off CU all the nerve pain that was flaring up and I just remember just like being on this bed pan and everyone's around me and there's just like a little curtain and everyone's like did you poop Yet Michael did you poop yet and I'm like is this it like is this my life now like everyone's giving me advice on how to move my bowels and I go this is probably the lowest we can go and I just felt sorry for myself but at the same time my front was all right we're gonna make it happen but deep down inside I was like who am I going to become now like my identity was that of a professional of a leader a dad a husband someone who was active and the doctors basically said listen you're probably going to walk with difficulty and you're most likely based on your injuries never going to get back on the bike again and I'm like you got to be kidding me this should not have happened and I spent 10 days in New Mexico they were going to fly me back on a medical jet which I thought oh we're flying on a Lear jet like this is going to be like high status Rec be like Van Halen like this is going to be cool so they put me on the air ambulance back to New Jersey for my first visit to a hospital in New Jersey I throw a blood clot during that trip so now I'm on kumaden and no one wants to take me so because I don't really have any medical providers back in New Jersey because I'm relatively healthy so I I would never go to the doctor and I'm 33 things are fine I don't need to go to the doctor the doctor is something that old people go to who are sick so you don't have like a primary care I have no primary care so we are trying to figure out how to get to the closest trauma 1 hospital near where we live and luckily one of our neighbors at the time was a plastic surgeon at hackin saac the trauma one Center that everyone wanted me to go to and she made the you know emissions possible so my story is is a team story we'll get into this but it's a whole pelaton story so here she's so kind she makes this happen and her and her team do my surgery there which was skin graphs to close up all my fasciotomies because I lost so much blood they had to cut fasciotomies in my left leg basically incisions to let my leg expand and swell up so the medical team there in New Mexico they looked at me they're like wow you look a lot different than your earlier photos cuz I was all fluid uph I was really swelling like Michelin man so that surgery I did skin graph my skin graph operations then I healed up and then they sent me to West Orange New Jersey The kler Institute for rehabilitation where they took my Superman Christopher Reeves after his equester event and I spent several months there and when I was there that's when I was like okay perspective is valuable because up until that point I was the worst off in the orthopedic wing of the of any hospital I was at and then I went to Kesler and my first three roommates were all quadriplegic and I was like oh okay this could have been a lot worse yeah and so then I started getting into okay how can I make this recovery happen and then a mentor shared some advice with me this he said listen everything is neutral until you label it because I was having a pity party I would have good moments and I'd have some really dark moments and he said everything's neutral until you label it this is an event and you get to choose how you want to look at it and at first rich I was like I don't know what you're talking about like is this some Jedi mindset trick and he went on he said listen there's some neutrality and it I think it ties back to what Victor Frankle wrote you know in between stimulus and response there's a space and in that space is your ability to choose and your freedom to grow so he's like let's just give it some space you get to decide how you want to look at this and I was like okay and eventually after that moment I saw okay well I can have some neutrality in all my moments I can choose my labels wisely and then subsequently I labeled the day of the accident my last bad day because I started to look at that as like one really bad moment but if I have people in my life when I fall asleep at night who I love and love me back how can I call the whole day a bad one so I was like all right I'm going to draw a line in the sand this is going to be my last bad day and I'm going to take an attitude that life is a series of moments throughout the day some are really good some are really challenging but when we get to the end of the day I'm not going to use binary labels to sum up how the day went so I'm going to just try to live fully into that experience of all the different moments making a conscious decision to apply this Frame this way of perceiving what occurred to you and locking in on that creates like this rubric for you to understand your life and and move forward and I assume that this person was it David yeah David well David was a mentor of mine that I write about he's in the ICU so here I'm in the ICU I don't remember anything about the ICU I told my wife to buy Amazon stock so I'm all drugged up like I I'm strapped down because I'm good good advice at the time it was $11 I don't know if we really I I told done that I told people like I don't think we bought it but we might have bought it through a mutual fund or something like that but imagine if she sold your house and just bought Amazon St we could have had a yacht next to Jeff basos yacht it would have been really fantastic except that I don't want a yacht but here I am in the ICU I have tubes coming out of me left right and Center they're strapping me down because I'm really agitated I'm pulling at everything and so I went to her and I said Amazon it's going to be a hot company we should buy some stock this is 2001 2001 right so I also interview her for a job on my team 45 minutes I go through the whole interview guide Rich those are some good meds well I've lived a very clean life so I low tolerance yeah I took nothing at all growing up here I am like a lot of meds all at once and so she you know she was patient with me she went through the whole interview and I get to the end of the interview and I said listen it's going to take me a while to get back to you I've had a little accident so I don't know when we're going to actually hire so she's writing down all these notes but I also said to her hey go find David he will show us the way and David is a friend a mentor he was also a coach that my company had hired to help us with a co-promote relationship with another Healthcare company and I didn't know back then that Executive coaching was a thing you know again there's now a zillion executive coaches out there in the world but back then it was rare and his sensibility his energy his approach was like oh wow so you don't have to be some bro and be successful so that was really the first opening and we had been working with him for about 6 months so here I am in the ICU and I'm telling her to go find David and I came out of the ICU and Lynn asked she's like who's David and I'm the type of guy that would never talk about work at at home I'm like what are you talking about she goes you just kept on telling me to go find David that he's going to find the way for us you know we'll follow the way from David and I was like whoa that's a matab ball but she doesn't even know who David is because you never brought she has no work home yeah but the other Ripple there is that that is is some level of awareness that you had at this time like you were able to connect the dots later to that kind of instinct like reach out for David and perhaps walking in David's footsteps provided this new future for how your life might unfold yeah so as I talked about you know I shared just a minute ago like where I am today is due to so many people planting seeds along the way and I think this is true for all of our lives like people are planting seeds and showing up in our lives in so many incredible ways we're just not mindful of all of it happening but that moment when I came out of the ICU and she said that I was like oh that's something I'm holding on to that one again I didn't know what to do with it but I was like there's something there and through other mentors it's like this whole notion that hey everything's neutral until you label it and then I came to this uh Buddhist parable about first Arrow second arrow and then my last bad day label made a lot of sense and so that story is about a warrior goes into the woods and she gets struck by an arrow or he or they and doesn't really see where the arrow comes from but it's hit by this first Arrow it's quite painful they fall down they wonder how they're going to get back up and and this first arrow is like the arrows that we get hit with from outside of who we are the external arrows in life the things are happening all around us but as they feel the pain of this first Arrow they start to ruminate they start to Fester around the pain that this is causing why' this happen I have to get back at the person who shot this Arrow at me and goes on and on it creates this big tail and a whole bunch of energy and it adds to the pain of the first Arrow that's the second can arrow and so what I've done since learning about that story again just to reinforce the whole last bad day notion is that I'm going to have first arrows in my life we all do they're going to suck they're going to be painful we won't want them to happen but I've made a determination that I was going to try my best not to shoot any more second arrows at me because before my accident I was really good at shooting second arrows at myself as we all do we beat ourselves up all the time so this whole first Arrow second Arrow Parable has stayed with me as a way to reinforce the notion of my last bad day because when people first hear that they're like oh this is like a unicorn and rainbow you know positivity thing right yeah it has nothing to do with that it's about the acknowledgement that our life is a series of moments and we're going to feel a whole whole bunch of different feelings and have different experiences from the moment we get up to the moment we go to bed at night and I'm not going to label the whole day in such binary fashion like I used to before my accident it's very human of course to feel angry at the driver that hit you and to on some level you know desire revenge and all of that I mean that is the second Arrow right so on a very practical level how did you transcend you know that need to get back at this person who had done you so wrong oh I had so many schemes rich I mean was there a criminal case or a civil suit or anything like that like what was the aftermath of that with that guy really nothing so what had happened is that the property was built on indigenous land so in a lot of ways I was not hit in New Mexico so there was a court case you know in the pblos court that we went back for but there was no jail like he was driving with a revoke license he had I think five DUIs on his record wow yeah and those are the ones that we knew of but there was really no punishment because to go to jail you would have to go to a County Jail which the play blow would have to finance and they didn't have money to do that so the judge gave him a big scolding and community service but nothing ever happened to that and that would just serve to deepen your anger and resentment so like how is it possible that this guy could do this to me and literally walk away from it that's what happened so in the early days I had a lot of time in my hands you know I couldn't read you know I basically had the attention span For Us magazine but not people because the only thing I could really handle was like who wore it best that's a very specific Nuance people were bringing me stuff to read I'm like I don't have the brain capacity to do any heavy reading People magazine long reads versus magazine photo captions absolutely and I could handle us but I couldn't handle people that that's that's where I I was so I would plot I was like okay how how can I get back at this guy cuz I grew up believing like an i for an eye like you harm me uh I'm going to harm you if you hit me I'm going to hit you back harder I was coming up with schemes in the middle of the night none of them made sense but over time as I eventually left the hospital system because insurance kicked us out plus I wanted to get home like I was tired of being in the hospital I was tired of that life and I just wanted to come back home I wanted to smell our house house I wanted to hear the neighborhood and so I was eager to come home and insurance wanted me to get home mhm and as I continued my progress a little bit each day so I had a little Mantra work hard today to create a better tomorrow work hard today create a better tomorrow and that was like my Mantra every morning and over time as my functionality got better my revenge orientation toward the driver ease but I still had a great deal of that especially in the moments where I would reinjure myself or things got complicated or I was feeling the effects of my injuries and my accident I was like that driver man he got off scotf free that accident took a moment and now I have a chronic life condition that's so unfair like I just wanted to get back at him mhm we took a family vacation in 2012 to Europe we went to Normandy we went to Paris we visited some friends who live in basil and we also had a private tour along with 50 other people of owitz from a holocaust Survivor Eva cor who passed away in 2019 at 96 but she came from Europe her and her twin sister survived the rest of her family didn't and she she gave us a tour of her life at owitz and for me I was you know this was stuff that I was supposed to learn in high school in history class but since I wasn't a really great student I sort of just paid attention enough my wife is Jewish we raised our girls Jewish so my wife knew Eva because she donated to her Holocaust Museum in terao so we had this opportunity to go to cra Poland take the train and do this tour her and Eva's known because she did a forgiveness project which is controversial as you can imagine but she decided that she was going to forgive the Germans and the Nazis not because they deserve forgiveness but because she did she thought if she held on to the hatred that she had for them she couldn't live the life that she wanted to live she couldn't be the light she wanted to be here we are it's the middle of July it feels like death there Sun's beating down and she's sharing the story and I'm like man if she if she can forgive them like what's stopping me for for forgiving him and on the train ride back I was like all right let me figure out how I can actually forgive him to take another rock out of my backpack and that was it like she but that was 11 years after 11 years that was hey I've been carrying that backpack around like you know as we all do like my whole life now it's pretty empty it's not completely empty we still have some stuff cuz you know we still are living but yeah I carried that around with me for 11 years now the rock that was in my backpack in the very beginning felt like a boulder like every time I had a a pain or a hurt or I couldn't do something or I was struggling with rehab man I went back to that guy like God damn him why did he do that why did this happen to me it took a while to get to why did this happen for me you know because a lot of people will be quick to be like we let's move Michael from you know this happening to you to this happening for you and sometimes those questions are really brilliant and I've shared them with other people myself but there's a timing to that question sure no one wants to hear you know about why it's happening for them yeah in the moment like I'm I'm in this like muddy gross difficult moment and I'm like I do not need that right now I just want you to understand that I'm in pain and just be okay with that but that first rock about him was really heavy and then over time it got smaller and smaller and smaller but it was still there there until we took that trip in 2012 and so when I rode my bike across the country in 2022 we went through terot and Lynn was able to go to the museum she had been ped for three years but we still wanted to go to Candles there and pay our respects every athlete I know is going to tell you that having the right gear is key to Performance if what you're wearing is poorly crafted did it's just going to put distance between you and those goals you've set you owe it to yourself to invest in the best and the best is on I'm obsessed with the cloud Ultra great on the trails and I just got the new NextGen Cloud Stratus 3 for the road I'm loving those but an also has this incredible line of lightweight high performance

their amazing lineup of super comfortable sleek and durable pieces for yourself at on.com on the physical side of things you undergo you know countless procedures I don't know how many surgeries like 13 surgeries yeah Lucky 13 like Taylor Swift months and months before you were able to go home and then how long before you got back on the bike because I know that's its own kind of Challenge and story yeah so I started to fall in love with going to rehab and so a really funny story when my oldest was in a preschool she said something to one of the preschool teachers about daddy being in rehab uhuh and the teacher was like that's really good that's really good honey like that's good that your Dad's getting help and she didn't know about the whole accident she was a new teacher and I was like well what are you talking about but so physical rehab for me it felt great it was structured I felt supported and I was getting ready for another surgery and then we finally had that surgery I had that surgery at the hospital for special surgery in New York which took a while to get to my trauma surgeon had to send a few letters to the surgeon at HSS because again here I am I'm unknown I'm a trauma patient now and not everyone wants to handle a trauma patient because we're complicated but eventually we have the surgery cuz what was happening was my left leg wasn't flexing enough and I wanted to see if I could get back on the bike so the leg was shorter it was behaving shorter than my right and it wasn't flexing enough and so this surgery we had and it was a success although when I went into it the surgeon said listen this is really complicated what happened when the bone started to heal I had a whole bunch of heterotrophic osificante crazy laying down bone so I had all this extra bone around my knee joint and so they had to chip some of that away but they were worried if they chip that away they could damage the fen pop bypass and if that bypass gets damaged then I might lose the leg so here I am getting ready for the surgery he said listen this is complicated if something happens while you're under anesthesia we're not going to bring you back we're just going to do what we need to do to save your life so I woke up I saw my toes I was like okay good surgery and I was making progress and then my physical therapist said listen it's time to get back on the bike and I'm like well I don't want to get back on the bike I like I like coming here like this is good like this is contained it felt safe and she said you can't come back to rehab until you try to get back on the bike and I was like well that that's not right like I'm the patient like like you can't do this I have insurance like you need to see me and she said no really like you're not going to get treated again until you try so this was someone in my life now who is pushing my buttons and we need people like that in our lives and I drove home that day and I went to my wife and I was like I can't believe her she said I can't come back until I get back on the bike and I was venting and I was all pissed off and I was the patient and I have rights and hbang and then the next day I went for a bike ride we went to the industrial park where we do Thursday night Bike races the kids came and we were all in our van and I got on the bike and I was all wobbly and my Dynamics on the bike as far as position on the bike was all a mess and I just started riding I was like okay all right I didn't have really great balance my pedal stroke wasn't fluid but man Rich it felt so good I was like okay all right and I would just do laps it was a mile loop at this industrial park and I was like okay cool the girls and my wife went to go get hot chocolate or something even though it was August I'm not sure why they went for hot chocolate but that's the story and we're sticking to it and while they're away I was like all right let's go on the road so this is a road that I ride on to this day you know th000 2,000 3,000 times so I get on the road I start heading towards New York cuz I live right in the corner of New Jersey New York and I could feel something coming up behind me and I'm like I look over and it's an SUV coming right at me white it was a Ford Expedition the bigger version of the Explorer and I was like you got to be kidding me like right now like I'm not ready for this and I held my breath and I gripped my handlebars and the whole shebang I stopped pedaling and and it flew past me it was speeding like most cars do and once it went past me I was like oh okay I think I can do this was the Explorer that hit you also white yeah same color same color everything but just bigger mhm and here's the thing a lot of people wonder like what was your hesitancy you know around getting back on the bike was it traffic and it really wasn't traffic what it was was I didn't want to see how far I had to go to feel quote unquote normal again how I share this is when we're on a diet right when're trying to lose a few pounds and you don't want to get on the scale because you know the scale is not going to lie but you put on your jeans that you haven't washed in about 3 weeks and they feel looser you're like no these jeans feel really good like and they're loose because you haven't washed them in a while and you don't want to get on the scale because you know the scale is going to be really truthful with you I knew getting on the bike was going to be truth serum like I was going to find out really quickly how far I had to go to get back to normal outside on a bike up until that moment I was doing the exercise bike in the rehab facility and I thought I was making progress so that first ride was okay I dealt with the traffic thing that was something but it wasn't the main barrier and then I was like oh okay you got a ways to go to get back to quote unquote normal mhm but that's when I basically Ed my method of like Okay small steps consistently over time so I would ride just a little bit further and then a a little bit further and then maybe a little bit faster and I would just do that and that's what I did since that moment so that was August 2002 and I just kept on laying down like longer rides and longer rides and then I did a charity ride from the Twin Towers to Washington DC in 2003 and then I just kept on doing like small rides and small incremental improvements and getting faster and riding with the big fast ride the Rocket Ride and I'd get dropped at one town and then next week I'd be dropped in the next town and that's how I built up my fitness again and and then in 2008 I had my first bike race back mhm right where I had that first ride Yeah Yeah Yeah you mentioned trying to get back to normal but like what is oh what is normal even right like and why are you even establishing that as like the goal like it's a new world now and like I've seen your left leg like it looks different like I don't know whether that's the skin Gras but it almost looks like you're missing you know certain swabs of muscle in there oh I am yeah yeah yeah there's there's so much scar tissue in my left leg that there's spaces where it should be muscle that muscle can't grow there it's like trying to plant something in rocky soil yeah it looks like somebody took a ice cream scooper and just scooped out you know still to this day when I ride every now and again another cyclist will glance down at it and some people will say something and other people will just like look and if someone asks they're like what happened and I'm like shark shark bite they're like really I go no no like uh SUV and and then I tell them listen you should be really so much far in front of me you know because I'm riding like with 1.8 legs that was sort of my story for the longest time until I had my total knee replacement and I guess it's still part of of my story but the way I looked at my left leg it was like 08 of a leg so the way I would celebrate my little wins with these big rides would be like I'm keeping up with these guys and I have 1.8 legs and they have two like all right Michael you're doing a good job like keep keep at it keep at it like keep moving and back to the question like what's normal back then that was my Fascination right as I was continuing to unpack and sort of The Unbecoming of who I was so I still had some old scripts of like oh let's get back to normal in society today we still have that we went through this incredible shared experience known as the pandemic and the big pushes so are we back to normal MH and normal is not a thing like what's normal normal is just what we're acclimated to or feel comfortable with right and it's a way of being in the world that makes other people comfortable yeah it feels it feels safe it feels certain it feels secure the great lie of course beneath all of it is is this sense of agency and control that is an illusion yeah yeah like we feel like we're completely in control but when you get outside and you look up you realize like you're just a little dot on this Big Blue Marble traveling through space and we don't have as much control as we we desire and the world's always going to be uncertain there will always be a bit of insecurity in it and so how do we want to dance with it right that can be very fear producing or you can put a different frame on that perspective being like kind of what you talk about so much and look at it as sort of a liberation yeah a light within which there is great opportunity to reimagine what you want your life to look like and just to kind of put a button on the cycling aspect of this you rode across the country 4,300 miles from Oregon to Virginia you've done all these cycling adventures and and kind of ultra endurance things in that world but more importantly all of these things that you've learned through this very extreme experience then begin to translate into all the other areas of your life not the least of which is your professional life yeah my professional life and really just how I show up today as a person we've done some pretty cool Ultra endurance things since the accident and for me I try to do these big things around the anniversary of my accident as a way to celebrate life and really get into into it and also show that we can overcome some of our most challenging moments that we face so during the pandemic I rode 19 hours this is uh 2020 I rode 19 hours inside on zwift which was crazy yeah I tried to raise money for 19 Charities supporting covid-19 so also happen to be the 19th anniversary of my accident date and as you mentioned I rode my bike across the country on a newly minted total knee replacement and that total knee replacement was a result of the initial trauma and then a couple months ago I wrote across New York State and next year I'll do something else that's pretty big those are awesome and fun and great achievements and I don't do those alone but what I'm most proud of is just how I'm showing up as a person as a friend as a husband as a dad and what this moment that happened 22 years ago how it's rippled into the current version of who I am I'm so fortunate along with my wife we've raised two really good humans you know and our daughters who are 23 and 26 and for me I'm like job well done like all this other stuff is really fulfilling and awesome but in a lot of ways it's it's gravy it's whipped cream because my primary job is to be a dad MH like to put good humans in the world that will put beautiful ripples into it so we can keep you know bending the curve towards a world that I think most people seek where there's more love and peace in it there's more understanding there's more belonging we hear and see and love each other more deeply today than we did yesterday to me like that's the job and we've been able together along with their efforts as our daughters to become really cool humans really cool adults and it's that work that I'm most proud of yeah what is really important yeah that's it like my [Music] feeling is that we all get to wake up every day and be very intentional about how we're showing up in the world my language is what kind of Ripple you're Rippling into the world what are you putting out there because at the end of the day we're all all in these big meat sacks that look good for a few years and then we have a few scars and blemishes and gray hairs and wrinkles and we get shorter and all that jazz and all that stuff that part of our aging is so beautiful But ultimately it's what kind of energy you're putting out into the world and we are living in a time right now that is calling us to put strong positive ripples into the world because I believe we live at an inflection point I do believe that a lot of the things that have happened are happening for us in such a way where we get to make decisions about how we want to move forward I came through my accident a lot of people would tell me like well this happened for a reason and I don't necessarily think things happen for a reason I think things happen and then we give it meaning we give it reason so all that we've lived through over the last four years over the last 10 years all these different moments I think we can put a lot of meaning towards it that can Propel us or motivate us to putting more goodness and peace in the world and that's how I look at it well we certainly have more access and tools available to us to facilitate that but it also feels like a very strange time in which what really travels most is acrimony and controversy and negativity and violence these are the things that you know our internet is kind of wired for our information systems whether it's the news or you know whatever appears when you scroll through your social media and it makes me feel like to put a message of Hope and positivity out there is almost like an act of rebellion because it's counterprogramming against what the algorithms know people actually want to see or what they engage with the most yeah and it takes so many more people to override the algorithm we need a whole bunch of tiny ripples out there to overpower the divisiveness and I also think we need just simple connection you know when I rode across the country I rode through states that see the world not the way I see it like their lived experience where they live is quite different than mine but what was common is this I think we all go through moments of pain there's suffering right there's suffering in life as as Buddha said and for different reasons we just have this pain that we're all dealing with and I think covid is this huge experience that accelerated a bit of the breaking apart like for me my accident broke broke me apart right I was this form broke me apart and then I went through a process of coming back together in some ways becoming a different version of who I was by letting go of some of the stuff that I thought I was I think we're struggling and this is more Global you know Global and here in the US that Co did a number on us and broke us apart and now we're trying to figure out okay how do we come back together how do we make sense of this how can we turn this into something that can create something that has a different type of beauty and I think we're we're living in that moment it takes a lot of courage and empathy and compassion and love and kindness and all these other great attributes to bring us together so as I rode across the country I met a whole bunch of different people and if we were online we'd probably you know could throw arrows at each other politically or how we saw the world but when I sat down with people we have so much in common there was a connection and just we saw our humanness you I went into Rushville Indiana the Mocha Moose Cafe in antiques so here I'm coming through Rushville celebrated their 250th anniversary in 2022 so it's small town America Farm country a pretty red part of Indiana because Indiana's red anyway and I walk in for a LTE and a blueberry muffin it was like midm morning and there was a table of 12 Elders you know they all had their coffee clutching their coffee and I could only imagine they were talking about whatever they were talking about world events Town Dynamics you name it and as I waited for my latte one woman said hey biker come over here and we got into like a 25-minute conversation about what I was doing and we laughed and we chuckled and we had like just this great conversation and as I left again they didn't really ask me anything about like who I voted for who I prayed to any any of that they all said you know bless you and it was a little bit of like the whole Cafe was listening in and there was just whole this whole notion of like you know like may you be well and I think if we can take a little bit more of that posture of like may you be well as I come in contact with you it's a way for us to build connection and hopefully more belonging so we can heal what needs to be healed because I think we have some healing to do I think we have a lot of healing to do yeah but yeah on a macro level how can we create a uh a fabric a culture that is this kugi effect that is the name of your podcast right so that's come up on the podcast before but explain what that is because it's such a beautiful metaphor for you know how our wounds can actually make us not just stronger but more beautiful when we wear them probably yeah so kugi is a Japanese art form and a philosophy so for most of my corporate career I worked for a Japanese global company and had the privilege of going to Japan numerous times and really fell in love with a lot of the concepts and culture so kugi is really embracing our imperfection so the way the art works you have a piece of pottery that breaks you know think of a a bowl it's often a bowl or a plate or it can be a mug so this bowl breaks and then the artist brings the pottery back together there's something called a urishi which is made from a tree and that becomes the lacquer when it dries it dries super hard and they mix it with gold and sometimes silver and sometimes Platinum but it's commonly known as the golden repair so the pottery all breaks in a unique way and it comes back together and the gold this urishi has a scar-like appearance and so when I was early early in my recovery my youngest was just tracing my scars on my leg she might have been like eight years old she's just playing with them you know playing with my skin graphs and I was like hey what do you what do you think of Dad's scars because there was a point Rich where I did my best to cover them all up because I thought people were looking at them and thinking like what happened to that guy and what's wrong with that guy so I would wear long pants when it was 95 out I was doing all I could to cover it up and she's just like mindlessly just scrolling she was like I think they're cool dad and I'm like okay and right around that time I also started to learn about kuki and so the beauty of it and there's also a Japanese term called Wabi saabi and together they talk about really embracing imperfection so wabisabi is about the beauty as things age when I rode across the country I loved looking at Old barns so there were a lot of great barns that are new and fancy but that old barn that has lived through something the wood has turned gray and cracked and there might be a panel that's fallen off like there's a story there and what wabisabi does is Embraces that it Embraces the impermanence of life that we're all moving and as you've mentioned multiple times in the podcast we all cross the same f line none of us are getting out of this alive but Embraces the fact that these moments go from moment to moment to moment and we're going to have blemishes we're going to have gray hairs and wrinkles and all that and that should be celebrated and kugi is about embracing our imperfections so it takes something that's beautiful the piece of pottery that Bowl before it was Broken Beautiful then it breaks and then it comes back together in a different way of demonstrating Beauty it doesn't have to be more beautiful because a lot of people have said well you know it was broken and now it's more beautiful it's like well all right and I've said that myself plenty of times the powdery was beautiful to begin with that's why you probably bought it and it breaks and then now it comes back together in just a different way of being beautiful scars and Imperfections and all that and so for me kugi is about connection it's about how do we come back together how do we connect with ourselves how do we connect with each other how do we connect with our nature because we're part of nature how do we do that and everyone has their own formula of how to do that but reconnecting there's plenty of parties out there and people that want to break us apart like break our pottery and it's up to us I think I mentioned this at the retreat finding like-hearted humans we often talk about finding like-minded people I think that's a problem because what we're doing is we're finding people who think like us what I want to do in my Pursuit is I want to find people who are like-hearted that are coming from the same place in their heart of compassion and kindness and love because I believe that's what helps us come back together and in this light-heartedness you can be open-minded to different thoughts to challenge your thinking to learn something new to unlearn what you learned in your past and be comfortable with not knowing and so yeah kugi to me is all about connection and it's all about belonging and so how do we do that you know like what's the makeup of your urishi that strength and I think it's a wonderful concept and as I've gotten older I've tried to embrace it even more especially the wobby saabi part cuz you know we wrinkle we gray and yeah in our society we want to cover it up you know I happened yesterday to go to a very bougie market near the studio here M and there was a lot of covering up the natural wabisabi yeah which is a very La welcome to Los Angeles but my feeling and I will acknowledge there's a double standard like you and I can go Gray but women in society it's more difficult to do that hopefully it changes quickly over time that we can all Embrace that but the definition of beauty is different for different people but my hope is that through this whole kugi Spirit we can embrace our imperfections and have a different relationship with perfection and just our flaws and really love on them well that cultural shift begins with our own attitudes and behaviors around these sorts of things of course and I love that idea so beautifully put by the way around seeking out and congregating with like-hearted people as opposed to like-minded people I I was talking to Julie the other day and and you know I was finding myself sort of somewhat depressed and bed after a scroll session on social media and I said I don't think we're hardwired or meant to know what everybody's opinions are on everything all the time you know what I mean like when you walked into that cafe and you you meet people as they are and regardless of having some dissonance in whatever your worldviews are you can connect on a heart level with people and I think that's what we're meant to do but when you scroll and you see people's avatars and their bios and then you get their hot takes and their opinions on everything you immediately the brain just immediately goes to how that person is different or wrong and how I'm right or better or you know whatever that rubric is whatever that math equation that runs in the brain and it's not really a healthy exercise like I just don't think we're supposed to like interface with people in that way no hey our biology was like we're part of a a tribe we felt safety and belonging we weren't exposed to millions of people online with a highlight reel like we have an evolve to handle that now the really cool thing as humans we have this beautiful prefrontal cortex that we can tap into when we keep it online and so we can have practices to help us engage with that because of all the creatures out there we've done some pretty cool things we've done some pretty horrific things but you know this part of our brain allows us to have better judgment hopefully to say okay well how do I want to process all the stuff that's coming at me but yeah part of our biology we're not used to having all these different points of view coming at us and also on the ex stream so quickly with just the swipe of a finger you know we went from being part of a community maybe getting a telegraph to then getting a newspaper to then getting a TV to then getting like radio or radio than TV and now we have all these social platforms and everyone has a voice and everyone wants to share it which is great that we're embracing our voice but it's a lot and I don't think we have evolved to the point where we can we can really process it in a healthy way in your case you have this accident which breaks you apart and then you come back together this kugi effect where you become this more whole integrated person as a result of that I think as a society we're still in the broken phase we have yet to you know find the tree sap that's going to you know meld us together and we're under this sense that well when something kind of happens that we can all unite around that will bring us back together but every time something like that happens it seems to further divide us rather than have that effect and so I find it at times difficult to hold on to the hopefulness which is the work I guess right yeah the work is to hold on to the optimism and the hope at the same time holding space for we'll call it the pain that we see in the world because we see the pain we feel the pain whether it's in our communities here in the states or worldwide and what's happening on the world stage that the common denominator is that people are experiencing some level of dissatisfaction or pain or suffering and I think a lot of what social media is about is like do you see me do you feel my pain like starting there with a compassionate or empathetic exchange of like do you see me do you hear me do you appreciate me for all my differences even though that I may not be like you like we can start there mhm but we're going so damn quickly we're missing each other and I think it's happening in corporate life it's happening in our communities you know the interesting thing when I rode across the country I could take in so much more when I was on a flat road going 19 miles an hour I could hear the birds better I could see the the mountains better I could see the cracks in the pavement but when I was going 45 miles downhill in the Rockies like my vision was like this and for a lot of society we're rushing towards I don't know what we're moving from this part of our morning routine in a transactional way to this part of the day in a transactional way we're just going from one thing like it's one transaction after another and we're blowing past each other we're not taking the time to say you know what rich I see you I hear you I appreciate you I love you all that's going on with you I think it takes us to slow down in order to start healing look what happened to the planet when we stopped in the early part of the pandemic look what Mother Earth did like we stopped we weren't moving and she started to heal herself and it didn't really take all that long and I get it capitalism and you know the engine of the economy we have to find a way to cohabitate with that but if we can slow down and pause just enough stop and see each other I think that's the way we can begin and we just keep on showing up in doing that because if we go from one big event like when George Floyd was murdered in 2020 at least for me that felt different and maybe it was because of the pandemic or because of the video imagery that we now can see it becomes becomes real in a different way and there was this big burst of energy right in a pandemic people came out into the streets to protest and it felt different and now we're three years removed plus and it feels like we didn't make much progress at all we can't fall back on big moments so my accident was a big moment but I don't get to this point unless I'm showing up every day making incremental steps towards what I want to see in the world and in my world and I think that's the work it's the work that has no end in our lifetimes we will not get this job done we will pass on to wherever we pass on to knowing that the job's not done it's not finished we don't cross the finish line we don't get to go hooray but we get the opportunity to show up and make progress towards it and hopefully we pass the Baton to younger generations and they carry on that Ripple and their work has no end and that's how we can get to a point where we can look back and be like okay we've made progress because I do believe society as a whole we've made progress like I can look at the us today and say wow we've made a lot of progress since 1793 but each day it doesn't feel like we're making progress at all sometimes we're it depends on what your definition of progress is and how you're evaluating that but I think yeah the job or the Legacy to leave behind is the positive ripple effect that on some level there's like a a little bit of immortality in that right like what can we leave behind that becomes an anonymous vibration that percolates through many people that leaves the world maybe just a little bit better than before and that's really it and you know in your own case you you not only practice this you work with other people like you've Departed the corporate world you're an executive coach so you counsel all different kinds of people on these things that we've been talking about today not the least of which is meditation mindfulness practices and breath work and you've got this app pause breathe reflect um so I want to spend of course a couple minutes talking about what that looks like so you've had these experiences you've learned you practice them you show up every day and you do a variety of things to you know create that ripple effect make your life a little bit better how do you work with other people to you know access some version of that in their own lives well as you mentioned I do it through my Executive coaching and also speaking at companies and through my meditation teaching and the app so I came into mindfulness while I was in the hospital so I had a moment while I was at Kesler where I was completely overwhelmed I was not making progress so again keep in mind going back type A personality got to make things happen go go go I got to get better I got to get out of this place I got to get back to work even though I wasn't sure if I really wanted to go back to work but it felt like that's the thing you do and I was plateauing and I had a moment with my physical therapist where I just broke down she was trying to help me move from my wheelchair onto the exercise mat and I was having so much difficulty doing it I couldn't do it and I just started to cry which was something I would do a lot of back then and she was like why don't you just take a moment and then I looked around at all the other patients doing rehab at that moment in time and I was like man why are some people getting better and some people aren't and what like again comparison like why am I not making more progress I think I'm working hard and what I remembered and this goes back to my youth and sports that anytime the game got overwhelming when it was going too fast a coach would say slow things down take a breath right if you get hurt on the pitch or on the field you fall down you're hurt and what does everyone tell you to do stay down you crash on your bike stay down breathe and I was like all right I need to breathe I need to find a way to slow the game down because everything felt huge overwhelming and going way too fast and I I had everyone with great intentions telling me what I needed to do well you should do this Michael you should do this Michael and I'm like I don't know what to do I want to get better and I don't know what to do and so the next day I was like all right new day new you and I got out of my hospital bed into my wheelchair and I wheeled myself to a quiet place in the hospital and I did a box breathing pattern for the very first time you know just a simple 4x4 4x4x4 and I just used it that was the beginning of my morning routine of like okay how do you want to show up now that you've calmed yourself down you get your head on straight I was doing some stretches some neck rolls and stuff like that but it was the beginning part of my how do I want to show up where do I want to place my attention what's my intention for the day so I did it once and then that day I had another big moment that went poor I was like okay great but the next day I went back to it and then I just started adding to it and again I didn't know much about mindfulness back then except I thought it was something a serious business person would not do mhm I thought it was like a San Francisco grape nuts granola type of thing to do which is common among a lot of people some would say woo woo but I didn't have that language back then I just thought no business leader does this I'm not going to do this but it felt oh good so I just kept on doing it and then eventually I labeled them as my pause breathe reflect breaks and the reflect part of it was the key so through meditation and through meditation apps we can sit we can pause we can breathe but the reflect piece was about how I wanted to show up it was space to practice gratitude which I wasn't practicing up until my accident it was a chance to set intentions it was a chance to understand where I wanted to place my attention so that moment of reflection some would consider it journaling now but I I couldn't really write because of my shoulder there was all chicken scratch but that point of reflection was just the space to say okay all right now what a classic you know mindfulness question what now and that was a big difference to my practice so I just started this practice on my own I wasn't really telling anyone I found John CID zin's work around mindfulness-based stress reduction and I thought that was cool because I was coming from a very scientific world where there was clinical data on things you had to prove yourself and what John did was brought an Eastern practice to the west and brought it into um's Medical Department I was like okay I think this can fit in my world but I still wasn't telling anyone certainly wasn't going to tell anyone at work because the Vice President of Sales is not going to get up in front of his a thousanders team in 2006 and say hey folks we're all going to meditate like no way it was too soft like we had to talk about hard numbers we had to drive the p&l and I actually had an acronym called profit before royalty that I was judged against PBR and I was like oh I can really play with this whole pause brether Flac it could be my version of PBR now a lot of people think of a different PBR here in the states when they think of that you know P FL ribb yeah P FL ribbon I've I've had people I've had people email me they're like I can't believe you are associating yourself with such a beverage and this is like they'll text me like throw up emojis and I'm like Hey we're on the same page like it's not my preferred drink so we're good but it has nothing to do with that but that profit before royalty that PBR privately I was like oh this is sort of funny this can be my it's a different version of you know pause breather reflect for me and I just kept at the practice studying other teachers learning about Ling kindness from Sharon salsburg listening to Tara Brock you know just furthering my studies in a very quiet way when when I came out of my corporate life I started sharing more about my pause breathe reflect moments I went on to get my qualification as an mbsr teacher but that practice is 45 minutes a day and who I'm trying to reach are people that don't have 45 minutes in their day and what I also found through my experience with a lot of people have these beautiful morning routines that have gotten a little crazy over the years and it's all transactional you know you might have a yoga practice in the morning a meditation sit in the morning but we're not bringing that practice and weaving it throughout our day and for me mindfulness is not an individual thing and I think here in the states we look at mindfulness now as an individual thing meaning it's something you do and then you go about your day as opposed to a sensibility or an energy that you bring to to every aspect of your day from when you wake up until you go to sleep at night yes and a sense of community so we will check off oh I I had a practice this morning yoga journaling what have you you might get a badge because we've gamified everything and we can feel good about it but we're not yeah embodying it we're not weaving it throughout our day so that's one part of the transactional nature mindfulness really is a way of living it's remembering to remember it's remembering to come back to our breath come back to our Center but there's also an element of mindfulness that's about community so here in the states we look at mindfulness as well here's a way for me to reduce my stress this is a way for me to get better sleep it's a way for me to be happier But ultimately if you go way back it's about how do we show up with awareness so we value the we over the me which is a difference between Western culture and Eastern culture so going back to this whole concept of like who are you spending time with who's in your pelaton for me mindfulness is about Community it's about the S so it's that element of it so it's more than transactional it can be as cliche as this is transformational but a way of living and it's a way of living that can help us connect with each other better because it helps us slow down so now we can see here and love each other a bit more than we have in the past on the reflect piece what does that look like practically you mentioned journaling but is that writing a gratitude list is that writing down your goals is that just reflecting on what happened yesterday and your Ambitions for the day is it up to the individual or is there a specific specific approach is there a prompt or something that can really drive home like how you want people to practice that reflection aspect of it there's an element of choosing your own adventure with it like so whatever gets you going that help you into a contemplative moment so it could be a gratitude list but I don't do a gratitude list I I practice gratitude every night before my head hits the pillow but I don't write things down I'll do some writing in the morning much like we did in Italy with morning pages so it could be a writing exercise it can be a prompt it could be hey what's happening in my body right now because mindfulness can be mindfulness of the mind it can be mindfulness of the body of feelings also of Dharma like you know sense of purpose so for me like I love to reflect on what's my body trying to say to me right now because I get a lot of cues from my body I the body Whispers to us before it really starts to scream and with all my scar tissue I have a whole bunch of nooks and crannies where bad ju guu can get trapped and so I'm just listening to like okay what's happening with the body what does the body need right now what might my heart need right now so for me reflect can be about that it can be hey this is popping up oh why is that popping up like what's that what's that story about it can be about a future orientation about all right I have this meeting coming up like I love talking to corporate people about doing a simple two-minute practice before the meeting so okay come into the meeting because you probably just you're rushing from another meeting another Microsoft teams resume so come in let's hit pause let's just take two minutes we're just going to connect with the breath and then we're going to leave 30 seconds for you to reflect on how do you want to show up in this meeting how can you be focused how do you want to communicate how do you want to collaborate how can you bring out the best of the people who are on this Zoom with you so it could be about that so my practice is have a morning practice which is great but take moments throughout the day where you keep on coming back home you keep on coming back to your Center you're coming back to your breath you're coming back to your soundscape you're coming back to what you feel in the body multiple times during the day so it becomes hey this is just the way I live so I feel something and I like okay ah time to slow down and less make sure I'm showing up in a way that's consistent with my first principles consistent with my values so I can live an aligned life and I think that can help people put out a more beautiful Ripple I think most people would be able to identify some aspect of their life that could be better or the little kind of scratch at the back of your brain like is this it is this really what I'm meant to be doing with my life is there something more am I on this honic treadmill in a way that I shouldn't be but this is my life maybe next time and yes we can bring meditation and mindfulness practices breath work practices reflective practi IES into our daily life in your case and on some level in my case it took a pretty extreme set of circumstances to shake us out of that and set us on a path towards like rewiring our lives so I guess the question I'm asking is do you think that that's necessary I mean obviously pain is like the great motivator right like if you meet your maker then you're going to be more receptive to making changes but what about the person who doesn't get hit by the SUV who's just kind of going along their way and they're in a little bit of a gray Zone like it's not so bad actually it's pretty good but maybe there's a more colorful Rich living experience out there for me but short of somebody coming in and just turning my life upside down I'm probably not going to reach for that like how do you connect with that person so they can get a little taste of what might be well here's where our beauty is cuz I don't think you need to have a big moment like you went through or what I went through I think the telling of your story Rich to all your listeners and now I'm going to speak as a listener and I promise I won't gush too much on you because I know that makes you uncomfortable but like I know there are millions of people that listen to this show each week listen to your guests and they haven't gone through a big moment like you went through or what I went through or some of your other guests have gone through but they're listening and when the moment's right they Implement maybe one or two things they maybe were an animal eater and now they like slowly moved over to being a vegetarian to them being a vegan they knew nothing about mindfulness but they hear you week in and week out talk about the value of a contemplated practice or they listen to some other guests so they haven't gone through this big huge the unexpected knocks on their door but they're paying attention and they're making incremental change happen they're developing healthy habits and when I share my story and when I look at the people in our community like with pause breathe reflect a lot of folks are said I didn't realize I could be a meditator because a lot of folks think well you know I got to be sort of monkik and I got to have this long practice and I didn't realize I could start a practice this way and they didn't go through something catastrophic they didn't have a big moment but they're like okay well there's something here The do open just a crack and I'm going to look in and is it safe do I feel like I belong and I'm going to open the door a little bit more take another step and then six months down the road they're like yeah I'm I'm different and that's what's powerful about the book you wrote and there's a funny story we can get to it later about your book when I first read it but but more importantly each week and sometimes multiple times a week as you are sharing your story and other people's stories people are listening and they're making these incremental changes and I think that's a really powerful Ripple hopefully they don't have to go through something like you went through or I went through and so I see it happening every day now for some people in order for them to get the message for me to get the message my mug my grand Barista so my mug is the acronym stands for Mother Earth the universe God I have a better relationship with God today than I did back then so whoever fills up my latte mug right so um they were like hey you hey O'Brien we've been giving you some hints you haven't been paying attention so we're going to give you something that you cannot deny we're going to stop you in your tracks we see you and we see how you're doing it and we just think you can do a little bit better and so I think for some people they need to get that big Stark moment that last bad day moment in order to have that change happen but there are plenty of people that went through what you went through that went through what I went through you took one path and I took one path and a whole bunch of other people take a different path and so I think it's a combination of listening to our moments and then being very intentional about how we want to go forward and what kind of life we want to have and I think that's the opportunity for all of us after the pandemic we all had a moment where we broke apart and now collectively hopefully I have faith that we can come back together you mentioned barreling down the Rockies and how that puts blinders on and you can't really see with any expansiveness when your life is moving so quickly and I think there's a lot of Truth in this idea that when you're living sort of out of alignment with a higher version of yourself that the Universe does knock like if you're but you have to be paying attention and if your life is moving very quickly and you have those blind Finders on it's very difficult to hear or see those knocks and to just engage with the denial of like well whatever and like push that aside and the knocks get louder and you know there's a little more chaos in your life and things start to you know get a little hectic or whatever like the intensity of that knock will increase and ultimately if left unheated you will face some type of crisis of some version or another because the universe will not allow you to you know continue down that path without consequences right in recovery it's like they say the elevator's going down it doesn't have to hit the the bottom like you can actually get off before you know the cataclysm it's just harder you know it's like it's harder to like you know just hit that pause button on your life and say I need a reset when everything is just sort of kind of okay but not as good as it could be but when the whole thing explodes you have no other choice and the question really becomes like what is your pain tolerance and do you really have to suffer in that way in order to make these changes because those changes are available to your point when you're paying attention and you're in the moment anything is possible and you have that facility to respond rather than to react and you know each one of those decisions is like a little branch on a decision tree that can move your life in a different direction and it's not about you know giant leaps and Broad Proclamation it's really what you're doing in the small moments every single day that's dictating what that life is going to look like absolutely and all those little moments they're not easily shared on Instagram no because and they shouldn't be that's between you and you and your mud or your higher power or whatever it is you want to call it it's your mug yeah that's the work that's the work those those moments between all the big moments that we happen to share and that is a private Affair and hopefully the people nearest to you that love you are along for that journey and sometimes when we're feeling pain but we don't recognize that we're in pain or some level of discomfort hopefully we have people in our lives that can help put up a mirror to what we're experiencing and sometimes that's what we need but how we all go through like little moments we don't have to get to the big one but like those little moments of discomfort or dissatisfaction or pain or suffering again we can phrase it in a lot of different ways in those moments are moments where we can open up our awareness and be like okay what's here who's around me who can support me um how do I step forward and yeah do the work do the work when no one else is watching and try to be consistent with it because you can look back after six months after a year and say yeah you made a lot of progress and that's the really cool thing about doing this work you get to look back in reflection and say all right yeah and it gives you fuel hopefully to continue moving forward Moment by moment pedal Stroke by pedal stroke so if somebody's listening to this and they're thinking I don't have a pelaton how do I even create my own pelaton which is just a a way of saying a board of advisers or people around you who can help guide your decision making or maybe I've never done breath work or meditated uh I'm just now beginning to try to do an inventory of my life and realizing it's missing in certain ways like how do what's the first step how do I begin this this journey Michael well you can download the pause Breeze reflect app which we'll get to yeah we get to that which you should certainly do but what's the wisdom that you impart around people who are at the beginning stages of kind of Reckoning with this type of thing for me what I recommend is begin to pay attention to what's happening in your body I think that's the starting point I believe we all have regardless of how fast we're going we know where we feel stress the most most and so we just we start to build that awareness like what's happening where do you feel it do you feel it in your jaw does it get tight do you feel it in your belly is it butterflies is it in your chest is there something else going on and so that is the first indication hey there might be something here and then you take that moment to pause and in that moment of pausing you can reflect okay there's a lot of options who might I ask so you mentioned the pelons so when I was in the hospital at Kesler my medical team came in doctors interns fellows nurses they were you know going over my case and studying me because that was an interesting case and when they left I was like oh I went to my wife they're like our my medical pelaton so they're helping me get down the road they're trying to help me heal and so for those that don't know but I think most of your listeners will know what a pelaton is it's a group of cyclists in a bike race like the tour to France they're competing at each other those cyclists but they need each other you know they're drafting off of one another they're pointing out road hazards there is efficiency in the pelaton the notion that together we go farther and we go faster when we're riding together there also needs to be trust and communication and all that and for me it's an analogy for how are you riding through life who's in your pelaton are you in a trusting pelaton that has connection and belonging and are you bringing out the people that are around you in the best way and are they bringing out the best in you so that whole concept of who's in your pelaton and I always love to get to the person when I'm stuck that can ask me that beautiful question so when I'm feeling something and I feel stuck then the person in my pelaton I go to is a person that is a really curious person that can ask a really beautiful question cuz we're really quick to try to find the answer in today's society but I would rather try to sit with the questions just a little bit of a beat longer and so I think a strong pelaton has people that can clarify things when we get stuck asking a really good question they can push us outside our comfort zone like my physical therapist did when she told me I had to get back on the bike they can be there when we're celebrating something and they put all their energy into our celebration and they're not trying to steal our celebration we also have people that can Comfort us when we need comfort and are there in a crisis those are just five different roles so listen to the body and then get with someone in your pelaton that can help you figure out the best plan forward and then start really small just begin with one thing so if it's journaling just begin with a paragraph if it's breath work begin with a minute and then do another minute tomorrow start as small as possible like the smallest viable dose right that sets you up for success and that's how I would recommend people begin if it's exercise you do five minutes you do a minute you know if it's walking maybe walk around the block so I'm a big fan of like start where you're at start where your feet are at and start really small so small it doesn't even feel like you're starting and that was my first breath work pattern was like I started small I was like okay that felt good I can do this and I just built it over time or when I came back to the bike I'm GNA get to this town line now I'm going to get to This Town Line and that's how we create success that's how we create habits that develop into the way we live so then it becomes automatic it's just like no this is just what I do like I started doing water first thing in the morning 25 years ago and now every time I wake up I get water first a thing in the morning it's just what I do I don't even have to think about it it's like putting on your seat belt when you get into the car before you pull out of your driveway you don't even think about it so what I try to do is help people find those really small steps that they can replicate over time and what is it that someone's going to find when they open up the app what is the intentionality and the architecture of how you've designed these practices in the form of a digital product that can you know move the needle for people in terms of everything you just shared well I hope people find when they open the app is a moment of Tranquility when they open the app and they can start to it's very relaxing it is I can attest to that yeah it's like all of a sudden it's like yeah before they even do a practice maybe that's the practice opening the app and just and then how I've designed the app is that there's a daily practice and again these are practices that are shorter it's like 5 to seven minutes long and then throughout the day I have short practices in a breath work pattern and it rotates throughout the day so if you pop in in the morning it looks one way if you pop in during the day it looks another way and in the evening we're looking to shut it down so you can have a gentle night's rest so what I'm trying to encourage is hey come back and just do a short practice a minute two minutes if you feel like you need to do a longer practice cool if you feel like you need to do a walking meditation because that's what the body is saying to you right now cool we have those but my feeling is come back home it's going back to when I was in the hospital I just wanted to come back home so the app is designed in that way to come back home and meet you in whatever moment you happen to be in so I try to keep it fun and relatable so if you're in line at a fancy grocery store instead of scrolling your Instagram you could just take a moment and just spend a minute connecting with your breath because you're going to be shocked when you get the bill so it's probably a good practice to do but it's like those moments before meetings waiting for do appointment stuck in traffic uh when you are shoting all over yourself when you want to have fun storm in the castle which is you know like I try to do practices that are not traditional like in the sense of how people think of meditation and mindfulness it's secular our community everyone belongs I don't care where you come from I don't care who you voted for if you have like-hearted I want to invite people in into your space and we're going to figure out how to become better humans together and that's what the practice is all about to kind of close this down can we do a short breath work practice can you take me through that all right cool we'll do one that's uh three simple inhales and exhales all right so in meditation the first barrier we have is like well how should I sit right so should I lie down should I sit should I stand so my recommendation is is just find a comfortable posture so you can you have your fingers exactly like this or it doesn't count you can have your fingers like this or like this you can have them open you can have them closed but let's just say we keep them open and we're just going to bring a sense of dignity through the posture and just you start to settle into it getting comfortable and then you can close your eyes as I do you can also have them open you may even wish to have a soft gaze so as we sit here in this comfortable posture we'll drop in and I always love to begin with a few healthy inhales and slow releasing exhales breathing in as full as you can through your nose if possible there nice slow breath out and as you do you might notice that you start sinking a little bit deeper into your cushion or chair now we're going to take the next 30 seconds and we're just going to do three slow inhales and releasing exhales we're going to breathe in for a count of five and then release with a count of five so as we breathe in breathing in 2 3 4 5 then breathing out 2 3 four five and breathing in allow you to count on your own and breathing out I'm breathing in one last time and now breathing out and then open your eyes and wiggle those beautiful fingers and toes maybe give your body a little stretch and there you have it just a simple 90 second practice just as a reset and now something may have come up during the practice that you might have noticed and you can Journal about it you can be reflective you can set your intentions maybe something popped up that was a moment of gratitude and okay that only took 90 seconds and now I can get on with the next part of my day and my recommendation is just keep on coming back to that keep on coming back to that beautiful I do feel better I was sitting here thinking we should have done this at the beginning so well you know like beginning during middle but it's so simple to do like our breath it never forgets about us like we don't have to direct it we take our breath for granted and you know my life prior to my accident I took my health for granted I sort I took my life for granted I didn't know anything about my breath I was like whatever you know except maybe from sports but the breath is there and it's our body's regulator so if we come back to it okay and certainly there's a lot of studies on the benefits of mindfulness and that's great there's Rich data that shows that it has it has an impact but for me studies aside like do practices that make you feel good if it's cold plunging get your Cal plunge on if it's journaling Journal so do these practices that feel good make up your own uishi your own lacquer to help yourself heal so then you can come into a different form of beauty and then when you're healed maybe you can Ripple that into other people and now we can start connecting as a community as corporations hopefully as a planet so and we can look back and say okay we did some good work well I think you're doing good work I think you are a living example of everything that you talked about and the Ripple that you're putting out into the world is a worthy one and I appreciate you coming here to talk to me and I'm honored to I'm honored to know you you're a really beautiful
