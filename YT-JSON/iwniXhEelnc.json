        "transcript": "I'm Rob Anderson welcome to my Alaskan king hi it's been a bit I haven't posted a YouTube video in almost a year but I just was doing a lot I was trying to get used to the internet how the internet works um but I'm back and I'm glad we got that settled okay the second thing we need to talk about this bed so why do I have this bed um I don't have a great answer but it was a trauma purchase from living in a small studio in New York that was like 400 square feet with my dog during covid um and no Escape I came to La I got way too big of a place and I have no furniture so this room was so big I'm like why don't I fill it with the biggest bed that I can find and I've always wanted an Alaskan king bed I've actually always wanted the floor of a room to be a bed right there's lots of pillows and you can watch TV and movies on a big screen with friends and this was the closest thing to it so I got it a few months ago I started a newsletter called the heartthrob Collective I've been compiling recommendations from Instagram stories of what people like to wear uh what is everyone listening to um what queer artists do you love and I've been putting them into spreadsheets and emailing them out once a month in that email is an advice column for sex and dating called on the Alaskan king and I was thinking Rob these are great questions you're already answering them why aren't you on the bed answering them for YouTube I hope it's good I hope you like it but most importantly it's easy for me to do am I qualified to answer these questions no I have no professional certifications in anything um I have a bachelor's of Arts in theater and media arts so if you're looking for health advice I'd ask your doctor if you want to submit an anonymous question for this you can sign up to the heartthrob Collective My newsletter the link is in the description and once you sign up you'll get a welcome email and in there you'll see where you can submit a question my partner is not a great kisser I don't know how to tell him I was once so angry during sex about it that I bit his lip he thought I was being kinkied if someone is a bad kisser like the first time you kiss them you're like this person's bad you have to assume that they're going to be a bad kisser forever one thing that can change but it's so innate with your sex appeal and who you are just depends on how important kissing is to you if it it's something that's non-negotiable like they have to be a good kisser or I can't do this it's probably not worth continuing to see the person and like them in other ways I enjoy being single me too just turned 64. everyone's insisting that I couple up do I really need to people are so annoying that is such like a heteronormative question asking people whether they're single or not or insisting that someone's in a relationship um no you gotta do what makes you happy hello if someone's insisting you do something and you're perfectly fine the way you are you need to find people to be around that don't ask you those questions don't get me wrong I love a good hookup but recently I feel like everyone just wants to hook up although I'd like a real connection is that too much to ask uh no friendships are special really special and hookups are much easier than a good friendship I've actually kind of run into this too here in La where I'm very sex positive and I love sex but I don't have many friends here so I'm trying to make them and I think something that's kind of worked for me is just not hooking up with people that I meet initially in social social situations that set some boundaries but not in a way that's like I'm too good to hook up with you once people stop with the whole like can we hook up can we hook up like once their minds pass that you can let your walls down and get to know each other a little bit more and if they don't drop it like they're just like you don't want them as a friend anyway how annoying it's too much you don't want to have a friend around who's just constantly on that zone like it's too much bye how can I become a bottom mentally I want it but physically it's painful uh some of these questions should probably be answered by a doctor or somebody like a GI professional um but here's mine this is really common it is really common and I've experienced it when I first started having sex I was so jealous of uh men who could bottom and enjoy it that much like how can you enjoy it this much it doesn't feel like that for me it doesn't feel like that at all it's so uncomfortable it's so painful but I psychologically want that so bad and uh I've learned a few things one is that you cannot trust a top to make you feel good some do but some don't the only thing they care about is what it feels like for them that is the only thing that is on their mind and obviously if you're enjoying it they are too but you can't trust them for it to work so you need to make sure that there's a lot of Lube on it and there are different kinds of lube that work better for different people water silicone a hybrid combination of both Spitz existing come if come is already in there it can work as a great lubricant but you need to make sure that it's lubricated because the top isn't going to Care they will put it in if it's like the Sahara like they do not care the second thing is you need to be relaxed and I know you're probably thinking like I am relaxed like I want it so bad you know you're not you're not relaxed enough um I think that even just the thought of that it's been painful before and it hasn't been enjoyable yet as you're about to have sex is making you tense up without even realizing it and one trick I've learned is that if you push out while they're pushing in it kind of helps you relax more it doesn't always work if you're too tense nothing will work but that does help last thing that's made me enjoy bottoming more is understanding the difference between what pain is and what a new feeling is because as you experience something in your butt that you haven't before it can all just feel like pain but some of it's just a strange feeling that isn't painful and I think like just kind of understanding and realizing like okay what's what here and just allowing the things that aren't painful that feel new to happen uh it'll get you uh more in the groove it can be a lot more comfortable on that note I'm gonna wrap up the video uh that was fun see it's always fun so filming them and then when I have to get behind a computer and edit it I'm like oh but I think this one will be easy we'll see it's going up regardless so I hope you enjoyed it thank you for joining me on my Alaskan king"
