        "transcript": "so i would love to get your reaction to this notion and it's not a far-fetched notion that defying us well one getting a congressional subpoena and then defying it is a it will be a badge of honor for a lot of these trumpers being hit with the subpoenas well it's not going to be a badge of honor when they find themselves in jail for having defied the order of the select committee to come in and to give testimony and to bring documents and so if that's what they think that they can defy the law and they can raise money and they're going to be all right they got another thought coming this is very serious and i want you to know our chair mr thompson is very serious about this these subpoenas are being issued we expect them to honor those subpoenas if they don't we'll go to court and thompson will go to court and uh we're going to win and they're going to have to either comply or go to jail and that's where they need to be um you know the two batches of subpoenas that came out earlier uh earlier in the week this week um set up a calendar where basically every day from this from november 29th to december 15th someone will be due to present uh to show up for a deposition and we could be in a situation where every day someone is defying a subpoena but chair waters of course donald trump could not stay silent on this i want to read you a statement that he put out this morning he writes no investigations on election fraud but if anybody was near the capitol waving an american flag they've had nothing but trouble american patriots are not going to allow this subversion of justice to continue including the use of prosecutors local state and federal to torment and destroy innocent people all this while our country is going to hell um he also said in a separate statement this country perhaps never done to anyone what they have done to steve bannon and they are looking to do it to others also i mean i'm sorry i had to read read that statement but well you know folks follow this follow this lunatic your reaction to the former president the former president is the worst threat to our democracy that i have ever known and perhaps anyone has ever known uh despite the fact that we're on different sides of the issues and the aisle of democrats versus republicans vice versa we've never seen anything like this this man has no respect for this democracy and he supports those who basically invaded our capital he supports those who threatened his own vice president mr pence and he continues to go along this separation line he has destroyed patriotism and those who are in his circle who are afraid of him really need to be ashamed of themselves in the way that they are trying to dismiss the law and not be in compliance and continue the big lie about this this campaign that they have had that said that somehow the president's presidency was stolen from him was taken from him we're watching uh the greatest threat to our democracy that we could ever see right now in the way that this president is handling himself and his inner circle who all are trying to defy the law but we're not going to give up we're going after them the american people deserve to have better than this past president let me get your reaction to what tucker carlson had to say on friday about steve bannon's indictment from what i can tell they are attempting to criminalize opinions that they don't like you're allowed to have any view of the last election that you want any view you want on anything in this country period your views cannot be criminalized because ideas and speech are never criminal in a free country but i don't understand that i mean the pretext for they're going to throw bannon in jail if they can because they don't like his opinions that's not what what's that issue here is it congresswoman waters it's not criminalizing opinions actually he knows that what he's saying does not make good sense no one is criminalizing opinion we all support freedom of speech this is not about freedom of speech this is about defiance of the law they think that they can get away with not obeying the law and this is about a an official subpoena that has been issued to bannon and he thumbed his nose at it he's been indicted and he's going to go to jail if he does not uh comply in the way that this subpoena forces him to do and i want to tell you bannon is a very dangerous man he is all about dealing with race and he said so and he said that if in fact they take on these issues and they deal with the race thing that they will win which meaning which he means that literally they're going to use race in order to fire up their people and to create confrontation and separation in this country bannon is as dangerous as president trump [Music] you"
