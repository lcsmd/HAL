        "transcript": "dear American people this is dear American people I don't know how to talk to like we we're going to have an election in November as to whether this guy becomes president again he's telling you he is an [Music] authoritarian happy Monday welcome to the buw workk podcast I'm Charley Sykes um joined Again by my colleague will salatan will I as I was mentioning to you a couple minutes ago usually on Mondays we have a lot of catching up to do but oh my God there is so much going on right now I mean we have we have the uh the rather pathetic sad trombone exit of of Dan santis we have the New Hampshire primary we have the weekend with the Adel Dawn to catch up with but uh anyway happy Monday good to be with you again thank you always fun it's fun for us it's a it's fun for us cuz we're covering this stuff it's bad for obviously America it's bad for any Republican candidate other than Donald Trump and really bad week for NFL kickers uh this was a bad week to be a kicker sorry sorry for your pack too too too soon to talk about the Packer game um also Bill the bills also you know there's going to be a lot of Reemployment a lot of a lot of churn in the NFL kicking Market I think I think it's going to be a boom market for sports psychologists um over over over the next few months but that's that is just me okay can we just start off with one like little bright moment um as as we all know uh Ronda sandis has quit the race and he he left it was so unbrand the way the way he he left he you know did a sort of a smiling video which was really awkward but then he left with a quote from Churchill about something or other which turns out to uh be completely bogus okay so his his his crack staff comes up with this quote attributed to Winston Churchill all the Churchill people said yeah he never said that here's here's the really good part though okay this is chef's kiss it actually the quote that was not from Churchill actually came from a 1938 Budweiser ad which I'm sorry it's like you know from from the shambolic launch with Elon Musk to this sort of pathetic taking a knee bending the knee to to Donald Trump so give me your thoughts on this I I I have my piece um up this this morning actually was up last night uh the the oit for The Campaign which I start off by saying it's almost too easy with Ronda it's almost too easy bad candidate lousy message awful campaign and then of course there's a republican electorate that did not want Trump light they when they had the real thing right as as somebody is what somebody said you know why would you go see the cover band when the Rolling Stones are still playing you know it's like I was on with Joe Scarboro this morning and he was saying you know it's like if if you actually can go see fat Elvis are you going to go to Vegas to see Elvis impersonator no they had the real thing so your thoughts Ronda santis out before the first vote is cast in the first primary and of course immediately endorses Donald Trump who's been mocking him accusing him being a groomer calling him to sanctimonious meatball Ron we're just used to all this now right right uh well you know in Santa's defense the fact that I didn't realize this came from a Budweiser ad but that does make it less filling that's any right um that by the way for for those who haven't seen if you haven't seen the DeSantis video not that you want to watch R rantis but that's as much makeup as I've ever seen this guy wear I mean this was a very carefully ER it's like the exit was planned for some time right it was all about the exit but you're right it's all about Ronda santis being a beta being abused by Donald Trump for months and months and then saying I endorse Donald Trump which of course what what they're all doing but he was supposed to be the Florida Alpha turns out to be when it really counts total thorough beta now Charlie I think the way that this is his life now right the way that he went out actually makes perfect sense he beats Nikki Haley in Iowa which you know 10 months ago should have been obvious but he managed to sink so low that he comes back at the end he just eeks out a second place which he's going to claim as a victory and just before he would get absolutely humiliated in New Hampshire in single digits right he gets out so he'll claim I was the the strongest candidate other than Donald Trump in 2024 and his ideas he's gonna run again in 2028 Charlie who is going to break it to Ronda santis that he was the problem that people don't like Ronda santis for president and so you you can change all the staff you can change the strategy but if your candidate is Ronda santis you're going to lose well also I by the way I completely agree with this um and then of course there's the completely unanswerable question now well what if Ronda sandis had actually run against the guy he was running against What If instead of waiting six months after the midterm elections and thinking that Republicans cared about legislation and policy and punching the libs and Mickey Mouse in the face what if he instead he'd gotten in right away capitalized on the momentum and it actually gone after uh Donald Trump would that have made a difference or is the Republican electorate become so Trump aied that none of it would have worked what do you again unanswerable we we'll never know because he didn't try right well he he probably decided uh I'm just inferring that the strategy that you're proposing and which is the strategy that Chris Christie tried was going to undercut him in the long term like he thinks he's got a long term so he was either going to inherit the Trump Vote or he was going to be the second fiddle and get out I I'm guessing that that was his stry Charlie one of the strangest things for me because I've been watching a lot of Ronda santis from doing press conferences in Florida running the State of Florida in Florida he is an alpha he is the alpha and he handles that role quite well so it's almost as though he decided he wasn't going to play that role in this race that it it was too dangerous to go with Donald Trump and I think a lot of what we need to talk about today is what we've learned about the Republican party and the falsification of this idea that you could run against Donald Trump and win okay so I mean I do understand what I think I understand what the strategy was which is to uh move to the right to make yourself absolutely acceptable to Maga world you know trumpism without the baggage trumpism without Trump because and the central calculation was that the Republican base would move on from Donald Trump if certain things happen including the indictments now as shocking as it is to people like you and I and probably to many of our view viers that Republicans have rallied around Donald Trump despite 91 criminal uh charges despite the fraud case despite the finding of of sexual assault it was also shocking to Ronda santis and to many of that world in conservatism in that we're just thinking you don't need to go after Donald Trump you don't need to take a shot at him because he's going to go down under his own weight once they come up with these charges and that really was you know the statement of the case here and so his miscal was fundamental so he's as shocked I think as a lot of other people of what's happened to the Republican electorate what do you think no I I I agree with that I think that I don't know what it is that he thought was going to take Trump down but clearly he thought some Dex makina something was going to do it for him because he wasn't going to do it himself right one of the Tells one of the tells about DeSantis is listen to what he says now about Nikki Haley and why she can't win and so even when he was still in the race it was him Trump and Haley and s's line the whole time was Haley can't do it and the reason she can't do it is because she can't win the Maga vote she's alienating the Maga vote she's running against that so that was a way of him telling what his strategy was which is I'm gonna be as Maga more Maga I mean he gets out of the race and says Trump wasn't as anti fouchy as he needed to be so he was running to the right of trump he was going to inherit that vote and he believed D santis was betting that you can't win the Republican Presidential primaries running against MAA and I think he's probably right he okay and let's let's just play his uh his Parting Shot he takes a as as he is you know taking a knee for Donald Trump um he is um he's taking a shot as he exits uh taking a shot against Nikki Haley here here's here's what he said it's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance they watch his presidency get styed by Relentless resistance and they see Democrats using lawfare this day to attack him well I've had disagreements with Donald Trump such as on the Corona virus pandemic and his elevation of Anthony fouchy Trump is superior to the current incumbent Joe Biden that is clear I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee and I will honor that pledge he has my endorsement because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yester year a repackage formed of warmed over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents okay so will what what is the warmed over corporatism that he's talking about here I'm not up on my disantis speak yet so warmed Nikki Haley warmed over corporatism right well one of the Hallmarks I think of the 2024 Ronda santis campaign was uh a rejection of the distinction between public and private that is DeSantis has fully advocated State interference in private Disney is the classic example I don't like what this what this company is doing I don't like it's it's woke po politics so I'm going to change the tax laws to punish it and he big Tech he proposed going after big Tech he rejected the traditional capitalist Republican party that said the government should stay out we may not like what companies are doing in terms of their politics whatever but we don't do that and so when he's attacking the the the corporate the warmed over corporatism of Nikki Haley I think that's what he's rejecting this is the end of the Reagan Republican party right it's yeah it's a culturally conservative but not but but not economically conservative party now well and I think that's just not Ron that's not just Ronda sandis not merely Ronda sandz I I I think that that that attitude is going to suffuse um you know Maga world and including a second Trump term that they are willing to use the uh powers of the government the regulatory powers of the government to go after to reward friends to punish enemies uh to bring people into line so let's talk about what's going to happen in New Hampshire tomorrow I want to have a caveat here that new New Hampshire has a long tradition of surprising people uh the polls would suggest that that Donald Trump is going to romp that even though Nikki Haley did get everything she wanted in terms of a two-person race it is her she is the last woman standing interestingly enough that it's a woman in the Republican Party the last woman standing against Donald Trump but let's do a little quick flashback here will um this is from Chris Christie by the way I really miss Chris Christie today um but I'm probably alone here uh he when he was caught on hot Mike the day that he pulled out of the race talking about Nikki Haley this is what Chris Christie had to say people don't want to hear it Wayne they don't want to hear it we know we're right but they don't want to hear it right and and there's you know we couldn't have been any clearer right we couldn't have been any more any more direct or worked any harder so you know forget she spent $68 million yeah I mean we spent well when you give land in China in places like like that yeah that's what you get yeah I mean look she spent 68 million so far just on TV spent 68 million so far 59 million by to santis and we spent 12 I mean who's punching above their weight and who's getting a return on their investment you know and she's gonna get smoked she's gonna get smoked she's not up to it thought thoughts on the eve of New Hampshire so I think the reason why I wanted to go back to this this hot mic moment from Christie is I think he got it exactly right and I think what we're seeing in New Hampshire is a test of two alternative theories of the Republican Party one is the chrisen Nunu the governor of New Hampshire theory of the party which was if you can consolidate the anti-trump vote particularly in New Hampshire where a lot of Independence AKA Undeclared can vote right and do vote it's an Open Primary um the that then you'll you you can take out Trump the because the Republican part is ready to move on right right what Chris Christie said on the hot mic was basically we tried this I'm getting out now because we we tried this idea of running of trying to find enough Republicans people who vote in Republican primaries to take out Donald Trump and we couldn't do it he says to his I think it's his State chairman they don't want to hear it Wayne they they don't want we tried we told people the truth about Trump they don't want to hear it they're I'm not doing well enough and he says about Nikki Haley she's G to get smoked now there are many reasons why Nikki Hy could get smoked some of is the way she's running right but some of it is that there aren't enough Republicans for Nikki Haley that Nikki Haley is winning Independence she's winning the Undeclared in New Hampshire but there are enough of them and Republicans in New Hampshire are voting overwhelmingly and they're consolidating behind Donald Trump so I think Charlie my big picture about New Hampshire the sonunu theory about the Republican party is wrong and the christe on his way out theory is right all right we're going to come back to sununu in a moment so um over the weekend I I think you know it is interesting that you know this thing is pretty much over it's going to be over in the next 48 hours and you know one Republican after another is you know is coming and um embracing Donald Trump I I and I do think that it's worth spending just a moment you know attention ought to be paid to what Donald Trump is doing and and and saying and can I can I can I just read something from from my my newsletter here I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm sorry I know I know it's obnoxious to do this but before we spend the weekend with the adal dawn um let's let's leave aside for a moment the defeats the impeachments the corruption the lies the rape the multiple felony indictments for the moment let's also Passover his calls for terminating parts of the Constitution his claim of total immunity his malevolence in his bigotry and the hundreds of thousands of people who probably died as a result of his demagogy on Co let's leave that aside instead let's just think about what he did this weekend you know and whether it is you know praising Victor orbon calling Vladimir Putin and and Kim Jong-un you know really fine people they were murderous thugs um you know what what what what El signal it again that that he would surrender Ukraine to Russia he throws Taiwan under the bus etc etc and then of course there was this entertaining moment where the stable genius confused Nikki Haley with Nancy Pelosi um let's just listen to that you know when she comes here she gets like nine people and the Press never reports the crowds you know by the way they never report the crowd on January 6 you know Nikki hilly Niki Haley Nikki Haley you know they did you know they destroyed all of the information all of the evidence everything deleted and destroyed all of it all of it because of lots of things like Nikki Haley is in charge of security we offered her 10,000 people soldiers National Guard so whatever they want they turned it down they don't want to talk about that these are very dishonest people okay so um you know Haley obviously you know jumped on that other people jumped on that like Nancy Pelosi and Nikki Haley are different people Nikki Haley was not in charge Nikki Haley was not in government at the time okay now considering how much investment Republicans are putting into the you know uh Joe Biden is senile and he's losing stuff it's really kind of extraordinary all of the you know the flubs and the the the addled rants that Donald Trump is is is going on but that was that was kind of a classic moment wasn't it oh totally totally so first of all I agree with you about the hypocrisy of it they're going to say Biden is addled but obviously Trump is clearly addled here but the second thing about this thing is so remember Charlie when every time Trump lies about the 2020 election there's this debate is he lying or does he actually believe he won where you going here so I'm still in the camp that he believes he won right Donald Trump is actually delusional and and that this is more dangerous this episode that we just saw in New Hampshire is to me more evidence of that it is he's he's talking about Nikki Haley he's talking about not her not having crowds big enough in New Hampshire and then he sort of in his mind Segways to January 6 and what a great day that was there were all these people who showed up and then he gets he's thinking about Nancy Pelosi in the capital and he clearly in his mind has just segwayed from one world into another and he's just transposed the character of Nikki Haley into that world and you're just seeing this guy who's who's I don't know how to describe this he's detached from reality he's confused to completely different scenes and you can see how in his mind he still believes that there were you know ballots in the suitcases in Georgia and that kind of thing this is extremely dangerous the fact that this guy is sincere but delusional is not comforting right he could get he could he could survive the Jack Smith charges of fraud because he actually believed it right and and and it would make it more dangerous to put him back in the white house because God knows what he believes what he will believe about himself once he's president again and and in the next election anyway I just think this is a window into the delusionality of Donald Trump well and and Nikki Haley to her credit actually raised that issue you know in the Twilight of for a campaign and by the way you know my formulation Joe Biden is old and what Joe Biden needs to say is I am old I am so old blah blah blah but he's old too and he's crazy and he's dangerous uh let let's play Nikki Haley because Nikki Haley actually you know Waits until the the 11th you know hour to unleash some stronger attacks on on Donald Trump and by the way she is not going to be his vice president I don't think there's any question about that so here's H here's Nikki hilly going after Donald Trump this weekend uh right right before the New Hampshire primary he talked about love letters going back and forth to Kim Jong-un Cindy would contact me she was so upset and he went and said oh but Kim said that he wasn't aware of any torture that happened to Otto all you had to do was look at Otto when he was returned back to his parents but this goes back to a pattern I mean we saw this over and over again it's not just that he congratulated pre China's president shei a dozen times after China gave us covid he congratulated the Chinese um Communist party on their 70th Anniversary we don't congratulate the Communist Chinese party I remember at the United Nations I had to sit him down and tell him to stop this romance with Putin I mean you can't have someone who's trying to Buddy up with dictators that want to kill us Boy you know you got to give her credit I mean you know I although she clearly thinks that she is living in you know in a time machine that took her back to 2015 where that's the way Republicans talked right because right so just just for a little context so she's talking about the OT warer case the American who was tortured over there and Cindy warer is his mom and so the larger Point here is this is what it would have sounded like as you're saying if Nikki hilly had gone after Donald Trump right and she's what we've seen in this campaign is the rightly or wrongly Nikki Haley oh rightly or wrongly chaos follows him right which I don't want to really criticize Nikki Haley for because Charlie you know I don't know if it's Nikki's fault but rightly or wrongly cowardice has followed Nikki Haley throughout this campaign right right so so she has she has not attacked Donald Trump but this indictment that she's delivering now about Trump and the dictators this is not a rightly or wrongly indictment this is a wrongly this is Donald Trump is wrong this is Donald Trump loves dictators she names the cases we know about The Love Letters to Kim Jong-un the stuff about President shei but this thing she mentions at the end I had to sit him down at the United Nations and tell him to stop this Bromance with Putin have you ever heard this story before NOP I've never heard this story Nikki Haley hasn't told this to all the people who wrote books about Donald Trump seems Seems relevant yeah I and she she needs to be asked about this she there's here is another former Trump official who has a story of directly talking to Donald Trump and his love of dictators and having to talk him out of his Bromance with Putin I want to hear more about this because clearly it's more evidence of why the guy for her book right and we know Charlie that she's going to endorse it when she gets out of this race right we know she's GNA do that well that's going to be interesting to watch it will be it will not be it should not be surprising um meanwhile um we we we should spend some time talking about this this new sort of denialism that's going on all of the you know smart anti- anti trumpers you know the Ross Doats of the world and who are you know Penning these you know the Hugh hu are saying you people need to calm down he is not really dangerous it's he does not pose a threat to democracy you should stop saying this because you are over caffeinated you are hysterical um do not take what he is saying seriously and yet here's Donald Trump almost on a daily basis saying uh no wait I really do want it to be a dictator I really do want to be an authoritarian I really do want absolute immunity let's just play a sound bite over the weekend two two two sound bites where he's um I I I think is is the first one about his immunity and then then of course the kind could we just mention the the irony of of him being the Law and Order Guy having just said that I want to be exempt from all the laws can okay right both of these These are both part they're all part of the same thing we're just shortening it by by doing it in two clips but it's all part of the same shiel all right let's let's let's play uh part number one you have to give a president full and total immunity and you know I liken it to a little bit uh police you have to give them back their Authority and their power because our country is crimer RI can hold them accountable for killing people right so it's like it's it is interesting that he links that together with police which we've we've talked about before um I'm guessing that if you asked him about well what about qualified immunity he would have no idea what you're talking about um but then he but then he says this you know having said that he wants full and total immunity from the rule of law he says this we have to go back to being a country of Law and Order have to do not for me and you will have very seldom but you will have the Rogue we call it the Rogue cup the Bad Apple and perhaps you'll have that also with president but there's nothing you can do about that you're going to have to give the president you're going to have to allow a president any president to have immunity so that that president can act and do what he feels and what his group of advisers feel is the absolute right thing otherwise you can to have presidents that are totally impotent and we've had them already okay so I mean I get this image of sort of you know the the Ross do thoughts of the world H was going nothing to see here nothing to see here and there's Trump going oh wait wait wait you know um I need to have total immunity um for like Rogue presidents because if I am not allowed to break the law if I am not above the law then I'm just not going to be able to do anything right well uh so okay now here's where like I don't I don't have a funny way of talking about this because I'm this is really serious so dear American people this is dear American people I don't know how to talk to like we we're going to have an election in November as to whether this guy becomes president again he's telling you is an authoritarian this is this is not sort of this is explicit authoritarianism this is the definition of authoritarianism so we have a guy who has literally tried to block the peaceful of transfer of power and stay in power after the people voted him out he has called explicitly for suspending the Constitution to reinstate him okay if that wasn't enough so he's vowed to send uh troops into American cities again that's a that's another trademark of authoritarian Insurrection but this thing that just happened list listen to his words people I want full and total immunity Charlie we talked about the comparison to Cops he's drawing the comparison cops only have qualified immunity Trump is demanding for himself unqualified immunity full and total immunity those are his words right he uses the phrase he says you have to give presidents their Authority and their power again author presidents right even rogue rogue presidents Authority power full and total immunity Rogue cops Rogue presidents there's nothing you can do about that he says and his definition of what will happen once you give the immunity is the president will have full authority to do quote whatever he feels is the absolute right thing what he feels this is the most explicit concise definition of authoritarianism you can get so Charlie We Can't Stop Americans for voting for authoritarianism but it is real clear we can make it clear what the election is a referendum is it is a referendum on this yeah so if I so if if I want to uh you know put my knee on the neck of America for a really really long time um I should be immune from do that so here's you know what the really bad news is I just had this flash as as you were talking that you know we could have people saying look he's he's already announcing that he you know wants to be the you know the Rogue president who is immune from from the law I can see mil Republican National Convention Donald Trump strides out on the stage and behind him in Bright Lights Rogue president that he's actually going to embra and his people will go out of their minds women will weep children will throw their hands up in the air the Rogue presidency and so even though you know we're warning you understand what he's saying he is talking about a rogue um poent potentially violent illegal presidency and if he elected you can't say that the American people were not told exactly what they're getting and maybe that's what they want I mean his comments about Victor orbon it's not just that he's has a bromance Victor Orban who uh governs explicitly as an ill liberal leader ill liberal strongman and I think the quote is something like you know yes Victor Orban is a strong man and countries need strong men you know he's very explicit Bally saying that Victor orban's illegal authoritarianism is a good model for him for us so again there there there's just there's just nothing there's nothing subtle about it that meanwhile this gets worse doesn't it um we not only have the denialists out there saying he doesn't really mean it we're also having the sort of the rationalizers and the normalizers where do you want to start with this because we certainly saw that parade over the weekend should we start with Tim Scott yeah let's go to Tim Scott and then we'll go to Doug beram okay we'll work up to that okay here's Tim Tim Scott who who by the way was appointed to the United States Senate originally by Nikki Haley and then as a thank you note to her uh turned around and endorsed Donald Trump and put on over the weekend I mean if it wasn't for the DeSantis staff this this is what we'd be talking about the incredible self-abasement of Tim Scott but here's here's Tim Scott uh rationalizing Donald Trump's recent Behavior Senator Donald Trump is um watching some pretty personal attacks against Nikki Haley who I know you've known for a very long time uh he suggested she isn't eligible to be president even though she is uh she was born in your home state of South Carolina she he repeatedly mocked her given first name Narada even though she has gone by her middle name Nikki her whole life are you comfortable with that kind of rhetoric from the president former president well I'm I'm watching rhetoric on on all sides of of the issues facing becoming president what I mean by that is the the the the rhetoric from Joe Biden is is terrible but it is in it scious Nikki Hy questions whether 70 year olds should be allowed to run for president I I think there is so much negativity and toxicity in this aim to becoming president again again or for the first time that we should be very clear and look at both sides of the comments made so what was that quad word salad okay so this so what is going on in the Republican party right now is we have the authoritarian telling everyone hey I'm an authoritarian I want a mandate for my authoritarianism and what's going on around him is the collapse of all of these Republican politicians into the authoritarianism they're finding ways to defend or excuse it or look the other way so Tim Scott's version of this is the both Sid stuff right well so danab bash is asking Tim Scott about Again part of authoritarianism is I want power and authority and I don't want anyone in my way but part of it Charlie what makes it really dangerous in history is targeting minorities right targeting so Trump called for a Muslim ban going after quote Hussein Obama now he's going after nimada Nikki Haley right they're using her indan berther stuff berther conspiracy is you know Theory which of course kind of launched Donald Trump I mean okay it is it is it is what Trump has always been the birther guy right finding so ethnic persecution is part of the danger of authoritarianism so Trump is making it explicit and Tim Scott is emerging as as a minority speaking out endorsing Donald Trump defending Donald Trump as he does this right and Trump and what what Scott is saying is that the ethnic attacks Trump's ethnic attacks on Nikki Haley and others are no worse than standard political Fair he's just saying that's you know Joe Biden says mean things other people say mean things both sides all sides so that's a way of normalizing the the ethnic bigotry and that's how we start to descend further into a mindset I think I think I think we're way I think we are way past normalizing it it's almost like the fact that he's bringing up the birth or conspiracy thing didn't even register I mean it's not it's barely a speed bump it's it's you know again we've normalized the normalization of these things and so he's asked about these really vicious personal attacks and and I agree with everything you said here I just don't want to over intellectualize it because it's also just the the the the embrace the embracing of the totaly of it I mean just the viciousness of it and Tim Scott cannot bring himself to utter the slightest criticism without shifting into the well all of the the toxicity you know I mean it's just it is so it is so pathetic but also the the ab absolute loyalty and we're seeing this again and again that it's not just enough to say I'm supporting Donald Trump you need to mimic or provide cover for everything he says you know like leise stefanic asked about immigrants poisoning the blood and she's raising her hand absolutely I'm saying that whatever he says they are going to embrace so this is this is a shift from 2016 where at least they would go all right well yes I disagree with that I'm you know offended by that you know but it's a binary Choice whatever way they rationalize now it's like no I'm I'm all in on this right I mean they're just it's it has it has moved the window okay you mentioned Doug beram for people who think that Tim Scott was the most cringeworthy person Doug beram um was a presidential candidate for about 10 minutes right uh you know and just kind of was around he's the governor of of North Dakota right I'm asking this because I I just the North Dakota South Dakota thing always you know kind of trips me up I mean Christy gnome um who maybe the VP is is South Dakota so uh he dropped out and endorsed Donald Trump even though at one time he had said he would never do business with Donald Trump so here's here's Doug bergham yesterday this was one of the high points of your Sunday morning I understand well listen to this I I almost threw a brick at the TV if I didn't have a break you did not so no TVs were damaged in the course of watching this though you just thought about it okay so let's Doug Doug berham okay Donald Trump has taken to referring to his opponent Nikki Haley by her given name a mangled version of that nimada the kind of thing he did with Barack Obama using his middle name Hussein he's also reported uh reposted false conspiracy theories saying she is not eligible to run for president because her Indian immigrant parents were not yet American citizens she was born in South Carolina why do you think he is doing this well I all I know is that I believe this election uh the primary election is going to be over after Tuesday uh president Trump is leading in all 50 states uh please answer the question sir time answer the question about why you think Donald Trump is doing that I think it's politics uh you know Joe Biden launched his campaign a couple weeks ago with a a set of personal attacks on President Trump uh he talked about President Trump he talked about the lawfare that they're mobilizing to try to uh slow him down as a cany he didn't talk about inflation he didn't talk about violent crime in our cities he didn't talk about the open border where we've had a massive Invasion and now we've had more fentanyl deaths than four vietnams in our country under Joe Biden the last three years no he talked about attacking his opponent that's politics around the world and it's politics in America so do you think that's the kind of politics that Donald Trump is using uh going after Nikki H's Heritage uh that will bring a country together I think that the uh I mean you could ask me the question about you know what did Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and Camala Harris say the the you know the vicious things they said about Joe Biden even during debates nationally televised within that party uh this is all in the norm inside of for for for politics in our country but once we agree as parties we get behind candidates the Democrats got behind Biden in 2020 I'm confident Republicans are going to get behind president Trump okay so that part the line of this is normal calling out somebody's felony indictments is just exactly the same thing as making fun of somebody's ethnic Heritage and implying that they are perhaps because of their ethnicity are not eligible to be president completely the same thing completely normal will right right so the line at the end where he's says it's all in the norm that's that's where I wanted to throw the brick it's a he's literally saying well you know it's Norm it's totally normal the ethnic bigotry is normal that say claiming that someone because of their Heritage is ineligible to run for president totally normal right so you might ask yourself why should we care what Doug buram says right as you say running for president for like 10 minutes the governor who cares about this guy and that's what gets me though this guy this guy is a nobody I mean not a nobody he's he's a you know billionaire whatever he's he's he's a governor but he was completely unimportant right and and Charlie we we know that all he's doing is running for Energy Secretary that's what he's been doing the whole time right and then he endorses Trump right before Iowa he wants to get on right he's made himself he is the kind of person who makes an authoritarian State possible right because he's a businessman he's normal you know he's a family guy he's a Christian whatever but when he's confronted with that over authoritarianism and over ethnic persecution he just says oh it's normal it's completely normal I'm ready to stand here beside Donald Trump be part of Donald Trump's Administration and defend whatever whatever he does or says well and and and this will be like at the top of his resume now for and and this is like let's get into the vep stakes in a moment um this uh you know the the the auditioning to be VP but also the auditioning to be in in the cabinet the number one thing on their resume is that I defended the most indefensible thing that you did which proves that I am absolutely loyal I mean this has now become the thing and so yes this is authoritarianism but it's also kind of the cult The Cult of Personality it's also the bending the knee to the total uh bottomless narcissism of Donald Trump that it's not enough for you to support me you must no matter what it is so first interview is going to be yeah they tried to get me to say that your racist attack was racist but I didn't Mr President I said it was completely normal yes you know right right and but this is you could if this happens Charlie if we have a second Trump Administration it is going to be full of people like Doug Bergen like Alise stonic it's all of these people who simply watch whatever Donald Trump does or says defend it excuse it salute it that's their path to slightly elevating themselves from governor of North Dakota to Energy Secretary or to becoming the house Republican chair um it this to have an authoritarian State you need these people this is one of them all right so let's about these this the this vep thing is it too early is it too early to talk about this because you can tell that the campaign is really um ramping up lots of stories lots of speculation what is Will's take on this what's happening so my take is that it's happening right now so there has been for folks normal people are not like us they don't have to watch a lot of this stuff but what's been going on on the campaign Trail for the last week or so has been a bunch of Republicans auditioning to be Donald Trump's vice president I mean and when I say audition I mean literally they endorse Donald Trump and the way they endorse it is they go up on stage with him right and Trump stands stands back five or 10 feet and beams folds his arms he's an authoritarian and the person does their song and dance so we've seen Alise stefanic do this we've seen vivec ramaswami do this we've seen Tim Scott I'm trying to think of who else has done it so far the santis wasn't Scott even got engaged he wants it so bad he got engaged over the week SC okay that's right yeah I mean and he's got a fiance he's committed to that person sort of but he's really committed to Donald Trump so all of these folks are putting on a show and I guess Trump is evaluating what how how glor so I by the way Charlie I have I need to get some gift advice from you so I play basketball and I wear some knee pads because you go if you fall on a hard court you can hurt your knees right um I have an extra pair that I haven't used and I'm wondering whether I can just send this you do I need to send a SE yeah should should I send a separate pair of knee pads to each of these people to stefanic and ramaswami and Tim Scott and the others or do I need to um can I can I just send one pair and can they circul maybe I could give it to Trump and whoever shows up can wear one the one pair I think it's completely unnecessary for you to send your knee pads to them because based on their current behavior they all have their own already I think that some of those folks have had those knee pads in the closet for a very long time so I don't I don't I don't think it's necessary for you to do it but I just keep thinking that you you need to understand the the overwriting um priority that Donald Trump will have when he thinks about this that it's got to be the most loyal least unpredictable possible candidate the vice president I'm going to repeat repeat this I'm going to repeat this endlessly is the one person he cannot fire he is I think still traumatized by um Mike Pence's extraordinary burst of Independence after you know four years of being a complete uh complete to he also knows that um in theory uh if we actually don't terminate the Constitution uh he if he's elected president he will be a lame duck president and that vice president will be the era parent and therefore a potential uh you know different Center of power so it's got to be somebody small unchallenging and absolutely loyal and dependent so I I it's an interesting formulation there I mean I if you had to if you put a gun to my head today and said who's it going to be I'd say Alise stonic but I'm guessing that in his lizard brain he's already thinking he knows who Elise stonic is he knows what a shape shifter she is she he knows what a completely you know ambitious opportunist she is and the fact that she's from Harvard might give him pause that here's somebody who is actually cunning completely without principle maybe smart but are they really going to you know be the toy when I really need them to be the Toady so far the answer is yes but right I so I really I love that analysis and as you were laying it out I was looking at my list of candidates here so the four people that I remember over the last week or so going up and doing the auditions are Doug bam vbec ramaswami Tim Scott and Alise stanic Lee zeldon was there but he's not in them running yeah and I asked myself the Charlie Sykes question what is well first of all two of these guys are ethnic minorities and that's a big Advantage because if Trump is going to run a campaign of ethnic bigotry he's going to need a front man he's gonna need somebody with dark skin who can rationalize this right and so Scott is already doing it ramas Swami I think would do it for him but let me come back to the Charlie syes test which is the next January 6th or you know who's the right who's the person he can count on to do his bidding when it's staying in power I have to cross out Tim Scott I don't think he's trustworthy he's a little too much in danger of being an actual Christian who might actually you know defend the Constitution might have actual beliefs very deep down there inside I mean Tim Scott don't you think he gives off a little bit of the Mike Pence vibe that he might do the right thing so I would worry about that if I were Trum you can't have any conscience lurking down there right okay right berham a cipher I don't know what you would say about him ramas Swami is pretty avidly Pro Trump I think and he's never been in politics before he's just a businessman he's he's he's kind of an authoritarian a little bit of a Libertarian too but anyway he might do it but stefanic she is so hardcore I mean I think you make a good point that she's a shape shifter but she is so avidly prot Trump and she will defend absolutely anything she's the only one I think who's who has said j6 hostages right yes the hostages poison in the blood she'll she will say whatever she has to say now right so so I kind of think if I were Trump I'd bet on her to defend me if I needed to override the Constitution at the end what do you think no no I I think as I said if somebody's had to pick somebody it would it would be her um know the Christy gnomes out there I I mean I think they're going to look at because you know he he see there's there also that that Quirk that Kink that he has that everybody has to look a certain way they have to be from Central Casting so you know if if I mean okay I'm going to get ripped for this but if somebody says to Donald Trump yeah Alise stonic is great but you know she has fat ankles that that could be enough for Donald Trump because this is a shallow shallow small man so he might look at chrisye nen and said boy she just looks better now of course the fact that she's she's diddling around with Cory lowski big negative but you know we're in a post shame manga world who knows um but I I just I just want you not to be too shocked if it if it's one of his kids I'm just just don't do not be Gob smacked if it's one of his kids I'm just telling you it's okay I will be Gob smacked if it happens with not many things but that would be one of them no no no no no who who else who else is out there that's you know in the in the world well you mentioned Christy gnome she's she could do it yeah but I don't know of of many others um Carri Lake no too crazy yeah I think you need crazy at this point you need someone who's going to but he he has a woman problem if you look at polls he definitely does much better with men than with women um so he needs to he needs to fix that the the minority thing is a factor um if you're G to go another white guy I don't I don't I just don't know I think Trump's got the Le stonic is the is The Logical one and and and I think you know the question is you know because she is incredibly loyal she will be an attack dog she will say and defend absolutely anything and if is her job to go after Joe Biden if it's her job to go after kamla Harris she will do it however one of the lessons that we always forget and we need to relearn every cycle is that not everybody scales up Ronda sandis was the ultimate Alpha in Florida but what happened when he tried to scale up and you know not everybody can make that particular leap and I and I don't think that people ought to be you know tremendously you know sure I mean I I I've watched her you in some of the press gaggles and everything and remember she's a you know Congress person she's not a governor she's not a senator she's just a congress person and so I'm not sure that she's had the experience on the national stage but he doesn't want to be overshadowed no no she's an appar and she owes her whole career to him I mean somebody who owes everything to Donald of course Donald Trump believes everybody Ronda santz owes everything to him right but have someone who is completely dependent I mean if you're if you're Trump and you're afraid of the the Mike Pence scenario Pence was the governor of Indiana Pence had an independent and right and that's the danger you don't want someone who actually believes something who has and who has a base other than you okay that that's a very very good point and and she would be totally his creature and totally dependent on on him um I I just wonder whether or not she's too smart for him um you know that he would be intimidated by that I don't know I don't think smart is relevant I mean I think to me one of the lessons of the Trump era has been that smart doesn't matter what matters is courage what matters is integrity and she has none of it in fact Alise the perfect to me what's perfect about Elise stonic is she is the inversion of Liz Cheney she is the person who would do for Trump what Liz Cheney wouldn't right and she replaced perfect right she's the the whole point of of aast Def what she represents in history is a person who who advertised her lack of Integrity right Liz Cheney had to be thrown out because she believed in something other than Donald Trump Alise stonic said what she won't do for you I will now I'm trying not to you know there's obviously a misogynous version but take out gender it's the same point the person who will do whatever you ask of them if you want to call the people who were uh who have been imprisoned for crimes on January 6th hostages of an legitimate government I will say that for you I owe my job to you I'll owe my next job to you I just don't see that person undercutting Trump okay no I you're you're you're you're persuading me but also your your point that Elise stonic is the you know inverse the the opposite of of Liz Cheney it's almost as if the symbolism is is just too too much in our face here is that the Republican Party replaces Liz Cheney with her that they look at Liz Cheney and her integrity and her honor and and her commitment to principal and they say no we don't want that we want this completely cowardly opportunist instead and they got her and they got her you know pretty good right I I you know this just can can I bring this back to sort of the demise of the Republic of the Reagan Republican party this is so it just for for people who have forgotten what the Republican party used to stand for it's you know limited government fiscal responsibility a strong role for America in the world Law and Order what Donald Trump is doing so what Donald Trump is doing on the campaign Trail in 20 he he he's been doing this 2016 2020 2024 it's all a continuation of just obliterating all of that Trump is on the campaign Trail attacking Nikki Haley for proposing to cut government programs for proposing to cut entitlements um he's attacking her for supporting Aid to Ukraine so he's calling you know he wants Republicans to be in isol aist party he's attacking Law and Order he's attacking the prosecutors courts judges juries now we're at the point of attacking juries and saying it's it's all illegitimate so that is the gradual obliteration of everything that it used to be the Republican party and what you're left with of course is whatever Donald Trump says so you you've gotten rid of Liz Cheney who had what a 95 97 98% conservative voting record by Reagan Republican standards right you're just getting rid of all that old stuff Charlie I don't think this party can be constituted as the Republican party I there what's going on is those people yeah the the Reagan Republicans and have left the part or are leaving the party they a lot of them have retired at the elite level but at the base level these people are now voting for Nikki Haley Donald Trump has complaining that half of Nikki Hill's voters are going to vote for Biden in the general those are the Republicans who are leaving right a lot of those people yeah and so there may be a conservative party in the future but I think we're done with the idea that it's going to be the Republican party because as Chris Christie said the Republican party as presently constituted people who vote in Republican primaries are not going to vote for a Reagan Republican like Chris Christie I I do not disagree with you at all in in fact I I I think that particularly as you as you think about the generational shift that's going on here right now again if you would have asked me about this back in 2015 2016 2017 I would have said you know there's there's going to be no youth magga movement I mean young people are going to be absolutely repelled but the reality is that most most of the people who are as you described them as Reagan Republicans they're aging out they're leaving they're retiring they are you know yesterdays you know the when you see the letters from you know former government officials or ex-members of Congress the key thing is former and x and there are there are as a younger generation again they may be a minority of young people a substantial majority of minority of young people but as you know Tina wi was describing in her book on the podcast last week There's this huge infrastructure bringing in an entire new generation into politics and those folks are going to be around for 20 30 40 years in the Republican party and I don't see that shifting anytime soon I mean there is an historic shift of the Republican party from being an internationalist party which it has been released since 1940 um but you know after 2024 uh there will be almost no vestiges of that left and it may be I mean how many years you know was was was that run it may be you know 30 40 50 years before this party uh changes its direction again I don't know I mean I'm sorry to leave on that particular dark note will so by the way it is January 22nd can you imagine how much smarter we're going to be one year from today assuming we're still around you know Charlie I feel bad because not once today I've got a pony on my shelf here and not once have I felt like reaching the pony not a this was not a pony day this was not Pony day this was knee pad day unfortunately yeah I think we're going to have many many more more knee pad days than Pony days coming up will it is great talking with you we'll do this again next Monday all right all right Charlie and thank you all for listening to today's bull workk podcast I'm Charlie Sykes we will be back tomorrow and we'll do this all over again [Music] too"
