        "transcript": "my name is David Andre and in this course I will teach you how to build and deploy AI agents so AI agents are the next big thing as you can see this is the Google Trends chart for search interest over time and it's basically growing exponentially so there will be an explosion of AI agents in 2024 that is given but just like the internet and the social media revolutions most people will miss out luckily I'll show you exactly what to do step by step to build your very first AI agents and anyone can do this even if you're another programmer listen to Andre kbuy you know don't listen to me listen to perhaps the greatest AI researcher of Our Generation and of course one of the open AI co-founders so he said I think it's very obvious to a lot of people that AGI will take the full factor of some kind of an AI agent meaning AI agents will be how AGI is built this is a screenshot from a talk he gave eight months ago on why a agents are the path to AGI and why AI agents provide a Level Playing Field you know he said that the Cutting Edge is much easier to reach in the agent the arena rather than llms where companies like open air and Deep Mind have a huge advantage in agents me and you can reach a similar level as the people at The Cutting Edge that's why this is such a great opportunity the agent Revolution is near and not many people understand this we are literally baby steps away from the explosion of AI agents and their popularity so so what is missing what are the last few missing pieces I believe that the great unlock will be a combination of things number one better llms the next generation of llms whether that's gp5 whether that's Gemini 2.0 or claw 4 plus cheaper API costs now this is huge when you're building teams of AI agents because the costs can add up quickly so cheaper API will allow us to experiment more and you know just to build more agents and the final factor I believe is missing is Simple and Clean UI just like C GPT because C GPT you know when it started it released with GPT 3 3 that was finished in 2020 CH GPT was was released in November of 2022 so 2 and a half years later even though the technology was there it was publicly available in the open ey playground nobody was using it why because we laed Simple and Clean UI and that is the exact same issue with AI engin there isn't a super simple UI that the average Joe can use now imagine having 20 plus agents working for you 2 24/7 this future is much closer than you think okay so what even are AI agents is important to define the terms AI agents are systems designed to make decisions and take actions towards a goal an AI agent acts on its own without needing for you to give it step-by-step instructions now this is a massive paradigm shift from anything we've seen before an agent can figure out the steps to get towards the goal you just give it a goal think of them as helpful assistants or employees powered by large language models agents you know the word Agents come from the word agency now the word itself deres from the Latin verb aere meaning to do or to act so an AI agent needs to do something chatbots like chat gbt don't have agency they cannot take action or do things they cannot go to your PC and create a file they cannot load up a website and do a post on there they don't have agency agency is action an agent without agency is just a passive Observer which means it's not an agent the GPD 5 moment and a lot of people you know there's a lot of hype around GPD 5 but almost nobody actually does the thinking what it implies especially for AI agents llms large language models are the brains of AI agents so more intelligent llms equals more useful agents you know like if you have somebody on your team that has 70 IQ that person will probably ruin your company but if you have a super genius with 160 IQ you can do a lot with that same with LMS gbt 5 will have better reasoning longterm memory multimodality and God knows what I mean we can only speculate what the emerging properties will be but it's clear that even if the jump assuming the jump is the same from GP gbd4 to gbd 5 as it was from gbd3 to gb4 we have a lot to look forward to so as soon as it gets released agent Builders like me and you will go nuts the development speed will be impossible to keep up with that's why we have to start now now is the time to master agents and again don't listen to me listen to Sam Alman once your Uber driver is talking about AI agents it will already be too late you know once every it's same with every technology like once everybody is telling you to invest into Amazon it's already too late same with Nvidia lately this is your chance to get the first mover Advantage because the only people talking about AI agents are people in the AI space you're not going to hear about Agents from your Aunt at Thanksgiving dinner now the ppppp framework applies here and that basically stands for proper preparation prevents poor performance and poor performance in this case would mean being unprepared when gbd 5 releases not having built any agents and being completely clueless and scrambling last minute trying to learn it proper preparation in this case stands for doing stuff now being prepared for those next generation of llms once you know the agent Revolution really takes place and being one of the people who can actually build an agent that maybe millions of people will end up using now this is actually what I referred to earlier the quote from Sam ultman so at y combinator w24 Sam ultman suggested people build with the mindset that GPT 5 and AGI will be achieved relatively soon now we can only speculate what that means but you know it definitely doesn't mean a decade probably means like one to three years so most gbd4 limitations that we can find in agents today will be fixed just by gbd 5 so we don't need better Frameworks you know more complicated coding none of that like so much stuff will be fixed purely with a better llm so you know expect gp5 in 2024 that's basically guaranteed I mean obviously it's not guaranteed but you know open a has so much competition right now that they have to release the model sooner or later so probably Q3 Q4 of this year and AGI perhaps end of 2025 beginning 2026 we'll see obviously it's impossible to predict now now which tasks should you actually give to your agent because this is one of the biggest decisions you have to make what like what do you employ your AI agent to do current agents excel at automating tasks that are clear this is probably the most important part clear simple with a well defined goal so instead of giving it like something ambiguous something you know vague like make me money that's not going to result in anything but if you give it something super clear like write a detail research paper uh on the latest five developments on archive machine learning AI like something like that can produce amazing results and save you hours of work so focus on small repetitive tasks you do every day not these huge once in- a while tasks this is super common mistake among beginner agent Builders they want to you know automate some huge task that takes multiple hours you know something complicated but instead just focus on something tedious you do every day because that's going to have the biggest returns and it's also probably going to be the easiest to build right for now forget about these huge automations that will save you eight hours of work just do something like something that's bothering you every day that takes two three minutes automate that with agent and like that time saves up like two minutes a day that like over a month that's 60 minutes that's an hour over a year 12 hours saved now it's absolutely essential to have realistic expectations and understand that current agents cannot do everything just yet even though they're absolutely amazing and even though the vast majority of people are underestimating how much you can do they can't do everything you know that would be AGI so how are agents actually used today well a lot of people have an automatic agent running 247 doing research for them so you know agents sitting inside of Reddit subreddits on Twitter Twitter on archive scraping for new papers I mean there are so many new Ai and ml papers published on archive every day it's literally impossible to read I mean even reading one paper is difficult right you can have an AI agent sifting through them summarizing them simplifying them and telling you the most significant ones and you can have that running 24/7 in the background huge software engineering obviously we've all seen Devon and what that can do and agents like Devon are building optimizing and debugging code and there are people working on open source version of Devon which will be absolutely huge of course customer service this is probably the most widely used uh way of companies using AI agents for example Clara the fintech uh company 75 of their support team are AI agents think about that 75% over 2.3 million conversations were done between their customers and their AI agents customer service and AI agents actually get better satisfaction scores than the humans which is kind of crazy this is a big thing you have to understand because knowing how to do all of this is the real value people who haven't built a single agent always assume that the end result you know the finished product is the priz is the great reward but it's exactly opposite the real reward is the skill itself it's knowing how to build and deploy AI agent why because those who Master this skill will always be in demand so become that person now it's also important to understand the difference between system one and system two thinking when we're building AI agents now you've probably heard of this book Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel KH man llms like CH gbd are only capable of system one thinking which means you know this impulsive like automat decisions like you do something on auto pilot like I don't know doing your laundry like tasks like you did hundreds of times before waking up the bed putting clothes on that stuff is system one it's fast you don't have to you know doesn't require a lot of cognitive load you don't have to do any advanced reasoning that's system one thinking and J GPD and other llms are doing exactly that with the next token predictions just instantaneous you know predicting the next token slow strategic methodical reasoning with which is system two thinking has not been achieved in AI yet agents however are the first step towards giving AI the ability to form long-term plans and execute upon them I.E a step towards system to thinking in AI systems okay the perhaps the biggest excuse and reason why people don't build their AI agent is they don't know how to code now I designed this course so that anyone even non programmers can follow along now to be honest to be completely clear there will be code however I will explain everything simply and in and in detail and very easily as as simply as I can and also members of my community will get pre-built templates and prompts linked below this module plus direct access to me if you get stuck so if you want to join my community the link is in the description now expect the unexpected when building AI agents things can go wrong I mean errors bugs crashes all of that happens no matter whether you're a beginner or whether you're senior programmer with 20 years of experience the key is to remain calm and not get overwhelmed don't get too stressed you know take a few deep breaths they're op stay calm you know stay in control open CH GPT this is the biggest hack and even people who know about cgpd still under utilize it and underestimate how much it can do especially in the coding domain so if you get stuck openhat GPD clearly explain the problem give it as much context as you can and try again chances are nine out of 10 times you will solve the issue also start small building AI agents can be intimidating at first I mean it was to me for sure the secret though is to start with small projects even stuff that might not seem anything useful what's actually useful is you're learning you're improving building the skill and you can do that on small projects on big projects like every single step you take will be something you learn take it one step at a time and gradually add complexity and fun functionality you know don't skip any steps because that's just a recipe for disaster take it one step at a time build something super simple then make it a bit more complex you know added some function calling some tools improve your PR do like more advanced prom engineering maybe try different models try mistol Gemini Claude like in over time experiment and add complexity but start small as Naval ravikant the great investor and philosopher always says learn the fundamentals deeply this is what the greatest teachers and you know Builders follow they don't skip to the last page of the book they learn the fundamentals deeply and only then continue now here are some popular AI agent Frameworks because there's a lot there are literally dozens of different ways to build AI agents and every week it seems like we get a new one so some of the most popular ones are Auto gbd obviously this one was the AI agent framework that kicked things off like the really first one that blew up then we had baby AGI then crew AI autogen multi-on Chad Dev metag gbt I mean there are so so many now choosing the right framework is perhaps the most important decision you can make when building AI agents so how do you choose a framework you have to understand it's not one siiz fits all meaning the best framework depends on you your level your goals and what exactly you want to build some framework requires you to be an advanced programmer and some require no coding at all so keep your skill level in mind I would suggest to prioritize these three metrics Frameworks with deep and photo documentation that way if you get stuck you can solve it lots of tutorials whether that's on YouTube whether that's you know just in GitHub read me whether that's on blog post doesn't matter just lots of tutorials the more the better always and low barrier to entry so it doesn't require some super Advanced setting up you can get started quickly those are the three main things I would look at when choosing a framework now personally in this course well I'll be building with three different Frameworks but in the second module which is coming after this I'll be building with crew Ai and why like what's the reason right well honestly there are a lot of reasons why I think this is the perfect AI agent framework for beginners first of all it there is no complex setup you can literally get started in a matter of minutes which is huge the documentation is also really solid the project is 100% free and fully open source which we always love and the developers are constantly dishing out new updates so you know it doesn't get stale it's always closer and closer towards The Cutting Edge now the future is here it's happening right now it's not some you know distant sci-fi wish pipe dream the future is here and you can be a part of it if agents aren't some far off dream the agent Revolution is happening right now like literally right now as I'm speaking Devin is Making Waves obviously and there are thousands of other super smart people working with AI agents so that is literally like perfect time to start and like do not get left behind like just please listen to me I feel like people I feel like those people you know when you go on YouTube and there's people videos from 2010 like begging others to buy Bitcoin I feel like the same way right now because 99% of people will never build a single agent in their lives and as a result they will miss out on this great opportunity so let's get to building the next module as I said will show you step by step how to build a simple AI agent with crew AI so see you there all right let's build our first AI agent with crew AI now what you want to do is go to cab. research.com this is the URL cab. research. google.com and the reason I'm using Google cab is because it's super simple much simpler than setting up Python vs code we're going to do that in later models but you don't even need to do any setup you just need to go to this URL and follow what I'm doing now as you can see I did print hello world just to test it out and connect to the runtime but uh I can actually delete this cell so you will uh it will look something like this and we want to do a code cell the first thing we need to do is we need to install crew I so do explanation point pip install create by the way if you are in my community all of this will be linked below the module so you can just copy my Google collab and have it side by side so run this should take about 15 seconds by the way the q- Q parameter makes it quiet if it wasn't there we would see a bunch of text flooding the Google collab and we don't want that so as you can see it's finished took exactly 20 seconds now I'm going to create a new cell by the way keyboard shortcut for that is crl m B but you don't have to do keyboard shortcuts you can just hover underneath and create Plus Code and for this one I'm going to do another package install but this time uh it's going to be crew AI tools so contrl enter to run it now this one took a bit longer as you can see 56 seconds one last package we need is python. n so it's actually already satisfied so okay this comes within Google collabs so you don't need to do this even uh the reason I wanted that package is because environment variables contain a API keys and you should never share API key with anybody so click on this files on the left this icon folder and you will see the files we need to put it in an environment variable if you don't know what that is it basically looks like this right and inside we need two API Keys the open API key and a serer API key and I will show you how to get both of these right now for the open 1 you need to go to this URL platform. open.com API keys here you will sign up with the same account you're using for chat gbd and you need to create a new API key click on create the new secret key can name it demo whatever create secret key now never share this with anybody as it says you won't be able to view it again so you can copy this and you put it into your environment variable so here you would go here and you would replace this right but basically you create a empty variable you can use a notepad I'm using notepad you don't even have to use vs code just name ITV right that's the open AP key now we go into serer serer dode create account takes literally 20 seconds it's completely free and this is for you know we're going to be calling the Google API with with Google server so do this sign up with an account and go to API keys and copy your API key once you do that again go to your and NF environment V variable and replace it here hit control save crl s or save once you have both of these in your environment variable NF once you are in the collab in here you drag the EnV file simply drag it in this file there will be the API keys so you don't have to expose them you know if you were to share this with anybody that's fine because they don't get the files so now that you went to both of these websites and obtained the API which again it will take you like 3 minutes per website so very easy to do the next step is to load it for that we use two simp lines beautiful we have loaded the environment file next we need to import OS and some stuff from crew AI now that's loaded next we do Search tool we assign the serer def tool to the Search tool variable just to make it a bit more organized next we need to import chat open AI from L chain now we're going to get into L chain in more details in future modules for now just know it's a great way to connect multiple tools multiple language models together now here is where the fun part begins here is where we start to build our agent copy the comment so now we get to Define our agents with for roles and goals so I'm just going to keep this super simple that we literally anybody can follow right and then we use the agent from crew AI inside we need a role and this could be like senior research assistant okay next we need to give it a goal this could be anything look up the latest advancements in AI agents the next step is to give it a backstory this is basically a system prompt or custom instructions doesn't really matter what you call it and obviously we will optimize PR engineering much much more in later modules again this is to keep it simple now verbose equals true this is whether you want your responses to be verbose meaning long detailed or short actually you know what for the demonstration is probably better to do false that way it doesn't take that long now this is important allow delegations now this is a one advantage that crew AI has over other agent Frameworks where delegating is like super hard to disable in here we can just do false right and the reason for that is because we want a researcher to do research we don't want the researcher to delegate this task to another agent now we give it a tool this is really what makes agents op this is the difference between agent and chbd you can give your agents tool and there are so many Tools in Lang chain and crew AI also has a bunch of them built in we are using the Search tool which is you know the serer def tool now this agent will have access to the tool and can use it can access the web with it last step in defining our agent is the llm for llm I'm doing gbd4 turbo but I just got that from you know if you go to back to open AIS API Keys you can click on documentation right here and click on models and you can choose which model you want obviously gbd4 turbo is going to be the most powerful one but you can use gbt 3.5 to save costs uh which will be much much cheaper now I want want to you know create a good Agent so I'm using gbd4 turbo temperature 0.7 which is the default check gpt1 you know what let's do low R let's do 0.3 that way the the lower the temperature the more consistent it is but the less creative it is and I want it to be more accurate to the search results it gets so I'm going to keep a lower temperature okay that's good I'm going to run this cell make sure to always run the sell you know you need the green check marks to to next to your all of your cells that way they ran otherwise you're gonna if you miss a cell you're going to run into issues we going to do one more agent this one is going to be a writer a researcher is going to get the information it has the tool writer doesn't need the tool we need to make sure I want to make sure both of our well actually this is interesting right so we can give the temperature 0.2 to our researcher but to our writer we can get a bit more creative we can maybe do 0.7 right why is allow delegation enabled in the writer the reason is simple because if if it needs some info it can tell the researcher hey I'm Laing info go look it up okay that's good and then go summarize the latest advancements in AI agents okay we can keep this uh the back story is good we have two agents we need to give them a task because without the task AI agent cannot do anything the beauty of crew AI is how simple this is now if you're not a programmer it probably looks intimidating but you know this is super simple you literally like you literally do task one equals task and then you type in the variables right so for description it's you just describe the task expected output full analysis report in bullet points as you can see we assigned an agent for this and for this task we obviously want a researcher an expected output is how you want the output to look at because that's got that's what's going to be going into our next agent which is Rider so let's run it now we need to do a second task this one is going to be for the writer and this one is different write a short article that highlights the most significant AI advancements AI let's do AI agent to be more specific now this is the important part for crew AI we instantiate your our crew right so we just do crew equals and we do crew and inside we need to define the agents in a list so let's do agents equals researcher is the first one and then writer now for tasks we do the same super simple and we just do task one task two task one task two and the last thing we can decide is verbos this is for you know logging levels I'm going to do one make sure to run the cell and the last cell is to get the crew to work so it's very simple we just do result equals and then crew. kickoff I'm actually going to do one two more lines because I want to print out the result because if I don't do this we don't see the result oops okay name results is not defined what do you mean oh my God this is a basic mistake okay yeah I type results instead of result but it doesn't matter what you call it you can call it results but just make sure the variable name is the same in both Fields right now actually you know what I'm going to go back and adjust the verbos level so I'm going to do true on both and the reason for that is because I want you to show the thought process of the agent now when you change something you need to run the cell now this is what I wanted we can see the agents thinking I need to gather the latest information of an advancements in AI agents of as of March 2024 but basically you can see the agent thinking and then action search the internet action input search query latest advancement AI agents March 2024 then it does the research as before and then F the Snippets provide a good starting point but I need detailed information to create a comprehensive analysis and it searches again the rise of a agents in 2024 I now know the final answer agents 2024 have become capable blah blah blah you can see it right here working agent professional short article writer so before it was the researcher research assistant and then you can see the task it's performing now we switched to the writer starting task using Insight provided by the short article and then this is the writer thinking action ask questions to coworker coworker this is beautiful senior research assistant question can you provide detailed insights to the latest blah blah blah entering new crew crew agent executor chain does even more research and then the output of the writer is here so this is the short article it wrote but this was completed in a minute and it went through like 40 different websites or something like you know this is you can customize these prompts however you want I'm just trying to show you a simple agent that anybody can build you can literally go here and change the tasks you want a different task rewrite this you want your agent to do something else rename him change the goal and give him a different custom instructions so again this will be linked below the module for members of the new Society you can just use use my Google collab and experiment with different proms test it out this is the module number two in future modules we will build self-improving agents using a different more advanced AI agent framework crew AI is amazing but it's also limited but I think it's perfect for the very first building coding module in what in matter like 15 minutes we got a team of Agents working to do very comprehensive research I mean how long would it take to go through all these websites it's kind of crazy so yeah this is just the beginning much more advanced agents to come which is coming out on the 19th modules number three and four will be released so"
