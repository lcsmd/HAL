        "transcript": "here is how to prepare for the creation of AGI by David Andre here's the honest truth most of you are absolutely delusional this is the Pol I it do you feel prepared for a post AGI world and then there is four different answers and these were the results 32% of you voted I feel super well prepared I mean personally I would only put people like Sam ultman or Elon Musk into this category people who have infinite connections you know access to endless amounts of money you know they're at The Cutting Edge they have teams of hundreds if not thousands of people they're actually building the AI tools those are the people who can say they are super well prepared the people who can say they're somewhat prepared are those who are deep in the ey field maybe working at one of The Cutting Edge companies you know AI research Labs or building a startup or at least a decade experience in the field this you know people in this category that's where I put would put most of us you know people who aren't that well prepared and then rest of the population goes into the bottom category who are completely unprepared but basically this is completely reverse to what the poll did and there's only one explanation for this the D and Krueger effect the people who voted they are super well prepared are at the peak of Mount stupid they have ton of confidence in themselves but very little knowledge so my goal with this course is to bring you down to the valley of Despair and then lift you up to the slope of Enlightenment here's my promise if you watch this entire course all six modules you will be more prepared for the AI Revolution than 99.5% of people even if you are new to AI so let's get on with it module number one prepare your mind this is the single most important module because if you don't fully understand the ideas and Concepts in this module nothing else will will make sense so don't skip around and watch the modules in order the most fundamental concept is technological progress cannot be stopped see AI is not exponential it's actually hyperbolic and this is why AGI is coming very soon by the way AGI is an AI system that is generally smarter than most humans boom one exponential curve the number of machine learning and AI papers published on archive every month next exponential computing power doubling every 18 months which is also known as Mor law another exponential the number of large language model parameters and then one more exponential is the interest in AI according to Google Trends as you can see the AI search term also looks very exponential and by the way these aren't the only exponential graphs there's more than four so not only does technology always keep improving but the rate of improvement is speeding up okay so AGI is going to be created soon but how soon well look at this graph this is the expected years until a general artificial intelligence becomes available and this is the average of the experts so if you look at the bottom I mean top left you see that before gpt3 was released it was 80 years then it was brought down to 50 and to 34 where it stagnate it for I don't know over a year and then Google Lambda 2 brought it down to 18 jbt brought it down even more the release of GPD 3 brought down to 8 years and now we're somewhere in here beginning of 2024 so if now the the expert predictions the average expert prediction if it's finally well tuned then AGI would be created somewhere 2029 2030 but if the error continues you know the decrease inreasing of the prediction as as it happens every single year then we are probably looking at 2026 2027 is when AGI will be created and actually this is the safe prediction a lot of people think that AGI will be created this year I mean David Shapiro thinks it's going to happen in seven months and he has a lot of metrics and data pointing towards that all right so we know that AGI is right around the Cor there will soon exist an AI that can do everything humans can do but what does all of this actually mean ideas that seem crazy now will soon not be crazy for example in 2015 when Sam ultman and the core open a you know Greg Brockman ilas Elon Musk and others when they said their goal was to build AGI people in the AI industry laughed at them but no one is laughing now second it means that AI will eventually be able to do every single job not just the jobs that are easy to replace every single job because AI will be cheaper faster and eventually better than all humans so it's not a question of if your job will be replaced it's a question of when will it happen 2 years from now which would be really bad or 10 years from now which would be much better in module number four I'll will go into this topic in way more detail I'll also show you how much danger your job and Industry is facing so once a starts replacing millions of jobs massive worldwide riots will happen everywhere at least that's my prediction every single major city on every continent will experience massive significant violent protests I think and governments will try to implement Ubi where they give money to people who lost their jobs by the way I think Ubi is a scam but more on that later and some countries might even try to ban Ai and make it illegal so we have to learn to embrace chaos and uncertainty everyone will feel this in the coming months I mean I'm no exception Sam ultman is no exception everyone will feel this there is no escaping this what matters is that you feel less chaos and more clarity than everyone else that's all that matters understand this the smart get smarter you've probably heard you know the rich get richer every all of us kind of understand that concept but the smart gets smarter That's A New Concept I learned from bellagi Amplified intelligence the smart gets smarter as their best at prompting the machines so since the AI will become smarter than even the smartest humans people who can extract the most information from the AI will get even smarter so that means the people who are on The Cutting Edge of AI right now will get even more ahead than they already are which means the ability to learn new things quickly is becoming Priceless people who resist learning new things are in trouble to say the least so if you find yourself having a negative reaction every time you are forced to learn something new you will fall behind so much and so fast that it's not even funny to beon honest module number two will explain how to learn fast and who to learn from this is also why community and networking are essential the easiest way to learn something new is to be around people who already understand it so surround yourself with people who are already preparing for the Post AGI world and your preparation efforts will be that much easier module number two skills you need to learn so information is the new gold understand this the post AGI world will bring a new order of importance and not many people are talking about this things that will become way less important include your income your degree your past jobs and your social status now to be clear these things will still matter they will still hold some level of importance it's just they'll be way less important than they are now things that'll become way more important on the other hand are your ideas your network of people your work ethic and your knowledge these things will be super important in the coming months and years so here is how to learn super fast you have to train your learning muscle because if you if your training muscle is weak learning will be difficult and you will be very slow at learning new Concepts just like working out learning gets easier the more you do it so do it as much as possible and here is an action step that all of you should do go to your calendar and block out 20 minutes a day every day to learn about AI doesn't matter if it's a new tool some AI news you know some concept deep learning does not matter just learn something about AI 20 minutes a day you can do it some learning hacks repeat new Concepts out loud now obviously this is not really viable if you're surrounded by people or whatever but if you're alone this can greatly enhance how well you retain information also apply what you've learned immediately if you learn something new don't you know store it and use it 3 days from now learn it uh if you learn it apply it right away and use C GPT to explain new Concepts in simple plain English use AI to learn about Ai and to learn new things because you can make chbt your personal tutor it already knows more information than any human could possibly do right and you can ask it to explain something in plain English in a bullet list in a paragraph in a story explain it like I'm 7even years old you know explain it in poetry in Rhymes there are so many different ways you can explain things you can ask it 20 times to explain the same concept before you finally understand it and let's be honest you would never do that with a human teacher because you would probably die of embarrassment right also another learning hack is employing the Richard technique obviously a famous physicist a legend and the best way to learn something is to actually try to teach it to others so if you learn something about AI try to teach it to your friends to your family to your Barber it doesn't matter just try to teach it to somebody else and that way you can see gaps in your thinking and you can you know remember something way more if you actually are forced to teach it a skill that will be absolutely essential in my opinion is prompt engineering now if you've never heard this before it might sound intimidating but prompt engineering is basically the art of writing text inputs or prompts that's used for large language models also known as llms such as cgbd so how good you are at writing prompts greatly impact how good the results you get are the same person can have the same AI model and get completely different results this is why prompt engineering is key the first step to be a good prompt engineer is to understand the model every model is different gbt 4 is different from Gemini 1.0 Ultra which is different from llama 70b which is different from mixol every model is different every chatboard is different so get familiar with the one you're working with the most also start simple right prom engineering as I said can be very intimidating and it's an advanced field I mean people have thousands if not tens of thousands of hours in this field and there is so much you can always learn and there is more for you to learn so don't try to be perfect just start simple and then experiment try something change a few words and analyze how the you know output changes another skill that is very underrated and that nobody talks about is touch typing in other words using all your 10 fingers to type so the average person types around 40 words per minute which is painfully slow and everyone I mean everyone can get to 80 words per minute quite easily so using the keyword is the fastest way to interact with the computer which also means the fastest way to interact with AI and sure there might be some better Technologies invented in the future I'm not denying that but for now the keyboard is still the king so Master it also be try to become techsavvy so learn how to use GitHub hugging face and similar softwares master all of your devices look at every setting open up your phone go to the settings and go through them one by one check see which ones are checked see what is unchecked you you might be surprised just how many things you can customize also you can start learning some programming I mean you don't have to be a professional programmer obviously but just learning a bit of python you know variables IFL statements for Loops that way you can see some code and understand roughly what it does this will become very essential in the time of AI especially because python is literally the language that all of AI and ml is built upon start using a password manager I mean so many people are sloppy using the same one password on all of their accounts and that's just like so risky all it takes is one site one company to be hacked and your password will will become in a bridge it will be put on the dark web and it it will be accessible for a couple of dollars and if some website gets hacked do you want your bank accounts to be accessible because you use the same password your main email like come on don't be sloppy use password manager also use software for to list I mean so many people write down their tasks on paper or try to memorize them which is even worse so like use some software whether it's notion todoist clickup aana I don't care also set up two Factor authentification to your most important accounts and don't do SMS to fa because that's easily you know hackable do Google Authenticator actually the two fa applications that generate a unique code every I don't know 15 seconds or whatever also more Tech tapes are coming in module 5 another skill is to improve your reading like most people have the same reading level as they did in second or third grade which is embarrassing so get used to reading more complex topics make the habit of stepping outside of your comfort zone and reading stuff that you know you normally wouldn't do also practice reading faster not not just more complex things but faster and there's like countless techniques you can do but the two most important ones are scanning and humming a great thing to read is new AI research papers and there is actually a large variety a large variety of difficulty not all of them are like super difficult some are very easy to understand and some are almost impossible to understand either way you're going to learn something new also extend your vocabulary you know if you read something and there is a new word don't just skip it learn it go to jbt ask it to explain it look it up on Google and try to use it in a sentence uh you know some synonyms and stuff like that just learn the new words all the time as AGI is getting closer and closer more and more Innovations and more and more changes are happening every week so there will be new phrases and words appearing all the time so if you can't learn or if you refuse to expand your vocabulary yeah you're going to be in trouble also learn from the best and Andrew Ang the founder of corsera you know he's the guy behind Google brain an absolute legend in the field emad mustak the CEO of stability AI Yan Lun from meta AI is one of the three uh Pioneers you know one of the three Godfathers of deep learning a Pioneer in the AI field AI explained is a fellow AI YouTuber he doesn't post that often but every time he posts it's a mustat David Shiro another AI YouTuber which has very unique and original thoughts which I value and of course the Lex Freedman podcast has tons of amazing AI related podcasts so some original thinkers who have great advice Naval ravikant Balaji sasan Mark Andre George HZ Paul Graham just to name a few other notable mentions Brian Johnson is great for learning about health Michael sailor is great for learning about Bitcoin and crypto Alex rosi for business Mr Beast for YouTube and content creation Robert Green for life and strategy and Ray doio for investing also you have to understand AI terminology ml stands for machine learning which is like the foundation of all AI llm is stands for large language model which for example chat GPT is an llm and GPT which is in chat GPT means generative pre-trained Transformer and there are so many more terms like learn what they actually mean honestly I might I might make an entire course just on AI terminology also Master the skill of taking action this is something I realized recently and it hit me like a ton of bricks you know it's no secret that most people don't want to work they don't like to work right so those who do will dominate in the post AGI world my belief and I'm very confident in this is that the habit of doing will be truly essential in a post AGI world so don't be a passive consumer of information be someone who takes action luckily you're doing great we've already completed module number one which is core ideas and Concepts done and module number two skills for the Post AGI era also done but this is only the beginning in module number three I'll explain which AI tools are giving me an unfair advantage and which AI tools you should ignore module number four I'll show you whether your job is in danger and how to see accurately how soon your industry will be automated by AI module number five is all about how to set up your life for a post AGI World which includes personal setup digital setup Financial setup information setup your health setup all of that and module number six I'll explain what the next 24 months will look like and what to do about it all of that and more is now available in my community it's a private group of people who are serious about AI look AGI is almost here the world will change dramatically and most people are grossly unprepared and I don't want you to be one of them so if you don't want to be left behind if you really are serious about preparing for the creation of AGI make sure to join first link in the description"
