        "transcript": "[Music] if you don't already know me I am a real estate broker and while I make educational videos on YouTube and in my course a link below what oh my gosh go go look at it look there's one on the floor go check it out as a real estate broker probably 90% of the people that come to me and say Kevin I'm looking to buy a house start with but I do not want a homeowner's association honestly I don't think I've ever in my career had somebody say I want a homeowner's association except for the fact that I know when I go to buy properties I can all like HOAs and let me show you new births pro-style why yes Jess oh my gosh you're right in history why don't we clean it so you looked at washing it yes they can be all right let's get inside hey what's your name and how old are you perfect the number one reason people do not like homeowners associations that is the reason the noobs don't like homeowners associations is because they think to themselves oh I don't want to be subject to rules and regs I mean who likes following rules I think I'm like the master of not following rules whoa let me train it to scare you that's like right in your backyard whoa that's scared you huh because you usually like trains Oh scary they don't have an HOA see that's the thing people don't like homeowners associations well I should say noobs don't like homeowners associations because there are rules and regulations that you have to follow so noobs automatically think all these rules are gonna be impressive they're gonna mean I have to bring in my trash at the right time I'm gonna have to paint my place a certain color I won't have the freedom to do what I want well the pros look at HOAs and say this is great when I go to rent out this property I won't be the bad guy the HOA can police the tenants I basically have a regulatory body that is going to make sure property values stay as high as possible in the neighborhood because we're not going to have people doing funky things and painting their houses painted baby blue or bizarre things that could otherwise reduce property values so from an investing point of view the pro looks at Nietzsche way and says yes I have a homeowner's association now obviously there are caveats right if not all HOAs are good just like not all light fixtures are a good idea see the big thing is qualifying the homeowners associations and if you want a little bit of advice on how to do that you can find out for free by clicking the link below look at the free preview course I have four qualifying homeowners associations it's like a nine minute video won't cost you anything to look at it but you'll learn a ton just from that one video take a look at this this is the kind of stuff that you generally won't find in an HOA it's sort of abandoned landscaping or bricks being piled up or sort of other inconsistencies like over here we've got palm trees and drought tolerant planting then these people have the leftovers of like a yard sale going on out there these folks over here have sort of made their front yard a back yard but then also in addition to sort of an inconsistency in fencing and landscaping who takes care of problems in some of the common areas like the tree that had graffiti on it it is just some of the small things that's not to say that I only buy property in homeowners associations but there are a lot of benefits that folks won't look at see here's a perfect example of what I'm talking about this is totally by a fluke chance but I was talking about baby blue houses and baby pink houses check this out you got a house with pretty much original paint that is it's pretty much non-existent and then right next door you got just another example though I mean car with flat tires the car is almost part of the fencing and this is an expensive neighborhood I mean these houses Laurel 600 grand plus look and I'm not saying anything is necessarily bad but it's just when you're buying houses in the median price range of the medium price is 600 grand you would expect some more consistency in addition to design guidelines you also have things like architectural guidelines that is what people are able to build but you go over here here's somebody who's turned one of those original 3-bedroom 1-bath houses into like an eighth bedroom house so they can rent out as much as possible at least that's what the reputation used to be maybe it's different now so as we walk on over to this townhouse complex which is called the boy Aventura garden these are called the Buenaventura Gardens and these are actually 1964 built converted apartments there were eight apartment units per building they've got about 35 buildings here so once you get over the fact that homeowners associations have rules and regs you might start thinking to yourself well what is after all the point of a quality association remember there are definitely bad homeowners associations out there which is why I encouraged you to check out the free preview on how to qualify homeowners associations and some things to look for when you look at these HOAs what are they they are a nonprofit organization that is they're not trying to profit off you in fact most of the people are working for the HOA with the exception of the primary managers or the management company are usually volunteers on the board and so on and so forth and the point is to look at these units these buildings that were all converted apartments eight units per apartment building for a combined 282 units what are they but a collective that basically spreads and mitigates risk of the entire neighborhood to every homeowner that means when there's a problem with the pool or a roof or there's a plumbing issue or whatever all of that risk isn't just concentrated on one homeowner but rather it is spread amongst everybody now look ideally the HOA dues that we pay cover for those things start allocating for those things and maintain a budget so that we don't have to pay what it called assessments that is additional fees in case more repairs come up which hood nobody wants to pay additional fees right ideally that's the case sure sometimes issues come up that are bigger than the HOA could have planned for or expected but again it's not all on you much like a homeowner that might have to replace their whole sewer themselves doesn't have to do that here said they're sharing it with everybody else cost is much lower so that spread risk aspect is another thing that moobs don't even consider and the pro looks at this house I can probably have a pretty consistent investment because I'm usually not looking at very expensive surprises that are gonna come up all right Jack what do you say we go in and check out this possible investment John no let's do it all right go ahead open the door [Music] so here's the thing when you buy a property like this either to live in at first and then to convert into an investment into the future what's something that's really cool generally the walls the plumbing within the walls the electrical stuff within the walls things related to the building are not your problem they're the associations problem what do you got oh my gosh what are these but these same sort of like light bulbs and outlets and stuff you got to take care of that stuff Oh leave them in there okay we don't want to break them so what's something else that's sometimes cool about HOAs is well they can include certain utilities like water now that might be bad for the each away because that might mean people are less conservative and the overall costs go up but keep in mind that a lot of times trash water or maybe even some other amenities like a pool or spa are included in your HOA fees so a lot of people looking go oh my gosh why would I spend $300 a month for a homeowner's association like what people have to spend here but you're actually getting about a hundred dollars worth the utilities covered you're getting shared earthquake insurance which a lot of people don't buy for houses and not all associations I'm serious all right let's get out of here let's go to a different house look I know a lot of people might get sort of discouraged when they're like oh my gosh they fees are $300 a month plus overdue or something like that that's that's way too much by me the HOA fees are $150 a quarter well you got to keep in mind that HOA charged based on what they provide like some of the things we just talked about but oftentimes I'll see homeowners associations that are $150 a quarter and all they provide is a pool and a gate service there's no insurance for the buildings there's no earthquake insurance there are no utilities that are included whereas in this particular neighborhood you do have those benefits of the HOA maintaining the roof the structure the exterior paint the rules and regs the pool the spa the trash the water softening water utility itself a lot of cooler benefits yes yeah what do you got nope oh yeah that's that's the other thing is their security so we can't get in now Jack slipped and fell it's not your liability it's all of the associations liability and I think that's what newbie investors forget is the rules and regs serve a purpose especially in the future long term keeping those values high keeping consistency high keeping tenants in line without you being the bad cop all the time do you like working with dad really do you want to do it more often do you want us to do it more often oh yeah that turning thing that you're turning right now cleans the seat huh yeah you've done a great job jack Oh your lemons what are they doing here so now we're gonna check out this house that is in a homeowner's association oh yeah look at the steps aren't going up so the reason I took us to this neighborhood is because this is a neighborhood that was built in 2008 and then we're gonna go over to a neighborhood that was built in 2003 and 4 and we're gonna compare this particular neighborhood is in a homeowner's association because it does have townhouses like over here you've got these two-story townhouses you've got a little park over here but the houses actually only have an association do of $18.00 per month whereas the 2003 and for neighborhood that we're just gonna drive by afterwards has no association dues so therefore no rules and regs and I want to take a peek at the differences now of course yeah there's a 4-year age difference but don't worry you'll see a difference beyond that let's take a look at this house first you know I always like coming through other people's listings and just sort of looking around I mean I like they got plantation shutters but golly dark dark dark this is a case where when you have this kind of dark flooring and it's also worn heavily worn flooring dark cabinets everything's pretty dark I'd either always have lights on or I would paint the very dark colors of the locomotor they have very strict architectural guidelines in the neighborhood and they just recently made everybody repaint their garages and they started sending violations for people who were not maintaining their paint on the exterior and then oftentimes when people do creative sort of backyards or out yards if you will you find that they're usually more maintained because otherwise the a choice arts setting the violations again yes yeah can you say river rocks let's go back inside hey now just an FYI for when you're buying houses when you find things like this the sort of peeling paint it's a sign that whoever repainted this garage door didn't use primer so maybe they didn't really know what they were doing something they know that sometimes that's Jack can you give me one second sometimes that's a red flag that they do a lot of things in sauce yes Jack let's go look at that big one that you keep asking me about oh my gosh that one's huge jack jack we're gonna look around for a second and we're gonna look at the houses with the window down just to see if the houses are pretty and well-maintained okay okay so let's just give this a little drive around here we'll just drive around some of these exterior larger properties here the townhouses those retail for about 500 grand the one we were just in goes about 7 750 the ones on the outside go for about 850 to 950 so let's video what we've got here and then just kind of remember these are 2008 houses but let's kind of look at the overall condition and how people's front yards are the consistency of the neighborhood and so on and so forth now let's go on over to this 2003-2004 neighborhood auto-pilot means the cars driving itself do you want to drive the car on autopilot what do you know it's a muffin bad do you know where he lives on duty Lane just arrived at the other neighborhood let's go ahead and check this one out so what are we seeing here we're seeing a little bit I mean overall it's pretty good right it's obviously a cleaner newer neighborhood but we do have a little bit more variation in the colors of houses a lot more people seem to have RVs some people have their garages sort of extending out into the driveway some people are parking off on sort of gravel or there they've got like a lumberjack yard going on in the front yard or they're doing carpentry in the front yard or over you know we've got a few we've got a little bit more variety going on so to speak so we've got some more variety in terms of the colors in terms of the amount of storage that we're seeing and we're seeing building maintenance standards maybe not as great as the HOA neighborhood been overall so pretty good so what do we have here with the new vs. Pro adaptation regarding homeowners associations and exposing them well we have on one hand the newb that says I don't want to buy in an HOA because if I buy an innate joy I might have to follow rules then you have the pro investor that says I get to follow rules for the little bit of time that I'm gonna be living here and then I'm moving onwards and the tenant has to follow the rules but not just the tenant everybody in the neighborhood which means no storing of junk what is the point of an HOA but making sure that other people around you also follow the rules and regulations if there's no HOA there might be conditions covenants and restrictions for a neighborhood those are called CC & R's but those don't really have an enforcement body that's the big thing missing if there's no HOA and that's what noobs don't realize is sure there could be rules and regs that say you're not park your RV but who's gonna enforce it you'd have to sue somebody to get enforcement done and we all know that in a fun process then we learned that a homeowner's association would also help sort of mitigate some of the risk of being either a first-time homebuyer or even an investor you pretty much have all of your expenses for building maintenance incorporated generally into the Association dues at least in good associations this is why it's so important for you to qualify a homeowner's association properly before buying into it the number one thing noobs don't realize when they're looking into homeowners association is dues history and the number two thing is do they consider does the HOA allow tenants and what's the process to get tenants approved to allow properties to be rented very important I feel like running then we have to consider that each will also provide you with amenities and sometimes they'll contribute to paying some of your utility costs which a lot of noobs don't consider they just look and say I can't pay this HOA now that's great because when you're buying you're already buying in at a reduced price if there is a homeowner's association but the only downside is let's say you have $300 in association dues and that means that properties are selling for about $50,000 less then a similar property that maybe does not have association dues there's one little pro caveat that the noobs might be right and thinking us a little bit of a downside with HOAs is that fifty thousand dollar amount that you're actually paying less in purchase price because you have the HOA dues doesn't lead to any kind of price appreciation for you that is if prices go up ten percent the one that's in the HOA doesn't get that extra sort of $5,000 on that fifty thousand dollars appreciation so there you have it HOAs new vers pro style exposed"
