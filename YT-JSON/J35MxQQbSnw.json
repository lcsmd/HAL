        "transcript": "gradient just launched accelerator blocks which makes it easy for any engineer to put together complex AI workflows without much effort and these accelerator blocks are interesting because you can take one and put it together with another in different workflows and so I'm going to show you how to do it if you watch my channel you already know about gradient they're a great AI company that have sponsored previous videos and they're sponsoring this video as well out of the gate they're starting with five accelerator blocks here it shows them personalization sentiment analysis Q&A doc summarization and entity extraction these are the most common use cases for AI at the Enterprise level so if you're an engineer you don't have to build this stuff yourself anymore you can use gradient and the best part right now all of it is absolutely free so if you don't already have an account come up here to the top right click sign up and sign up for a new account once you do that you're going to be dropped in your workspaces list you're going to come to the bottom and you're going to click create new workspace and then give it a name now I've already done that V2 right here so I'm going to say go to workspace now remember almost everything you can do from the interface you can also do through code and I'm going to show you how to do that as well so these are the accelerator blocks we have all five of them listed at the top right here and I'm going to show you how to set it up one of the most common use cases for AI right now is retrieval augmented generation or rag basically giving a large language model additional context additional knowledge so it can answer questions about things it didn't previously know about and why is this so important well if you're a company and you want to be able to have a knowledge base that can be asked questions like Chachi PT would rag is the best way to do that but let me show you right now so go over to the left side click rag Collections and we're going to upload our first collection now I've already done this my rag collection but we're going to create a new one so go ahead click create up in the top right and I'm going to call this Harry Potter so I've downloaded Harry Potter in the philosopher stone it's in PDF format let's see if it works so the supported types are text PDF CSV MD and docx so we can go ahead and choose files and then we start the upload and it's very fast so we can already see the stat status is uploaded and we should see processing there it is processing right away so what it's doing is it's chunking the document and creating a vector store from it and again all of this is done for us now it is so simple now creating the rag collections is the one thing that you need to do through the interface everything else can be done with code so here we go it's ready now we can actually test it out so click over to model testing and we're going to be using the amazing mixl 8X 7B instruct model we're going to tick this on rag completion and we're going to select the Harry Potter rag collection if we open up this Advanced dropdown we can set the temperature the top K and the top P but we're not going to touch that right now so what happens in the first chapter of the Harry Potter book hit enter now it doesn't stream so keep that in mind it's going to generate the entire response and then output it and there we go already and there is a summary of the first chapter of the Harry Potter book now let's go back I also created another rag collection called my rag collection and what this is is Microsoft's 10q document so basically their financial statements so if we go back to model testing we come over here we turn this back on again and I'm going to select my rag collection and we're going to ask how much revenue did Microsoft earn last quarter all right and based on the context information provided so it did reference it perfect it earned 49,000 million so 49 billion in revenue for the quarter ending September 30th 2023 and let's keep asking what are their main sources of revenue and I absolutely love that we're using the mixol model here based on the provided context the main sources of revenue are productivity and business processes intelligent Cloud personal Computing unearned revenue and international operations perfect okay so now you see that it is super easy you really don't have to think about much you just upload the documents you create a collection and then you can access that collection through the model testing tab but also through code let's click back up to accelerator blocks now let's go over to document summary so document summary is you provide it with a bunch of text and then you just ask for a summary this is an extremely common use case for AI and now it could not be more simple and not only that we can train it with examples so if we click here we can give a source document so we can give like a little sample of the document that we want to summarize and an example summary so if you want to guide it and get better summarizations this is the way to do it and we can also select the summary length short medium and long so once again let's use Harry Potter so I gave it the first chapter of the first book of Harry Potter for the summary length I'm going to choose short I'm not going to give it any summarization examples let's just see it work then I'm going to hit submit and there is the answer the first chapter of Harry Potter and the sorcer of stone introduces the dersley family who are prideful and dismissive of anything magical and mysterious and it continues so that's good now let's try a medium length summarization and there it is medium length perfect now let's say we want to do this with code let me show you how to do that so I opened up visual studio code I have a new file called gradient. py I'm going to open up a new terminal in Visual Studio code and then we're going to install gradient so pip install gradient ai-- upgrade then hit enter and it should install no problems then we need our access token and our workspace ID so we're going to Output these lines of code right here and then we need to fill this out so coming back to gradient we're going to come down to account select workspace we're going to look for this V2 and there is the workspace ID right there so we just click this little copy button switch back to visual studio code and we're going to enter it right there with quotes now we need the access token and then we click this more button we click on billing then we click over to the access tokens Tab and we're going to generate new token then go ahead and enter your password grab your access token I will be revoking this before publishing the video we're going to switch back to visual studio code and paste it in right there with quotes of course and save the file okay once we have our gradient access token and gradient workspace ID we need to do a few things we need to make sure that those are accessible using environment variables the first thing we're going to do is actually import OS right at the top there so the next thing we need to do is import the libraries that we need so we're going to say from gradient AI import gradient and summarize params length I'm pretty sure summarize params length is included in gradient but I'm going to import them both just in case then we need to set a variable with our gradient Library so it's as simple as that gradient equals capitalize gradient with parentheses now the next thing we need to do is create the document and all the document is is a set of text that we want to summarize so here I say document equals parentheses and then line after line of text that I want to summarize all the way down to the bottom and then you close the parentheses now if you remember back to the gradient UI one thing we can do is actually give it examples of summarization so that it actually gets better at summarizing in the way we want it to so let's do that so we're going to create an examples variable and it's going to be an array of example pairs let me show you one open up the curly brackets we're going to call the first parameter document open parentheses and then I already grabbed one so we'll use that and I'm going to paste it in right there this is another paragraph of text about Apple and then we're going to give it an example of summarization so right after that we're going to add a comma and then we're going to give it a summary example and then here is our summary example so with all that in place now we actually have to run the summarization and all we need to do that is say gradient. summarize and we pass in the document and the examples and then we're just going to Simply print it so we gave it the document we gave it some examples let's see what it gives us okay so we got an access token issue one thing I forgot to do is we actually have to wrap it and set it as an environment variable so to do that we do os. Environ and then put that in the environment variable and same thing with gradient workspace ID so just like that we fixed it let's hit save and then play all right and here we go this is the summary based on the example now let's do something a little different we're going to scroll down to the bottom and rather than printing the result from these EX examples we're not going to use any examples and we're going to base it on the summarization length that we want okay so here we're going to be using our summarize pams length Library we say medium we want a medium summarization length we set that as the length variable then we have another variable result from length gradient. summarize same as before and instead of providing the examples we're simply going to provide the length as a length then we're going to print it let's see what we get all right there we go okay so that's how easy it is to do some mization with an API with gradient now we can also do sentiment analysis we can do personalization and we can do entity extraction now I think entity extraction is extremely interesting so let's give that one a try and as I mentioned these are called accelerator blocks which means you can build one on top of the other and that's what we're going to do we're going to take the summarization and then we're going to do entity extraction so we have that result right there Then below that we're going to do some other things but first we want to input import this part of the library so we're going to say extract pams schema value type and we're going to add it to this import statement right there so we're going to be extracting two entities we're going to be extracting the company and the product and if everything worked out properly it should be apple and apple Vision Pro then we do this gradient. extract we pass in the document but rather than document we're actually going to be using this result from length so we input it right there and then the schema we pass in like so and then we're going to print the result at the end so I'm going to save it and let's see so now we're taking one summarization block and then plugging that into the entity extraction block okay so we have an error and it says string type expected so that's a validation error and I suspect it's because this result from length is not a string so what we're going to do is we're just going to double check what type this variable is and then we're going to convert it into a string so we're going to print result from length right there and let's take a look okay so this is a hash obviously so what we need to do is actually grab the value of summary so that it is text only so let's add that key right there we'll save and then we're going to play one more time all right Perfect Look at that so we have the summarization right there and then we have the entity extraction right there company Apple product Vision Pro headset perfect you can play around with the accelerator blocks they have other ones like the Q&A that I showed you the sentiment analysis personalization as well play around with it let me know what you think as usual gradient also has fine tuning of models that you can also play around with check out gradient at gradient.
