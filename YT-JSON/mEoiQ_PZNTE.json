        "transcript": "I look I did a lot of yelling last stream chat really finds a way to just aggravate me you aggravate me you get me all wound up close chat but okay so let's I have a name for the field I'm open to the name changing um the name of the field is entropics all right thermodynamics and tropics Tropics can answer questions like how much intelligence do I need to prove for Mars Last Theorem how much intelligence do I need to be a 2011 chess all right how much intelligence do I need uh to compress Wikipedia so entropics is the science that answers these questions um I've seen it called scaling laws before so we're gonna take a look at a few papers um so um a few a few things we can say intelligence is compression all right so which gives us a unit not exactly okay so what's the unit um the unit for hotter price stuff is usually uh bits per character um bits per character what's a character right I mean you can usually or when you're talking about compression you think about a compression ratio um but these things aren't good units all right so the unit I propose is the person which is 20 petaflops but I mean in the same way our horsepower is like how many watts again um so a few interesting analogies you can make uh you know the Industrial Revolution Revolution is to the horse the horsepower energy thermodynamics all right so what do we name this revolution I I tried a bit with gbt and I couldn't get anything better than AI Revolution um I mean I don't know maybe it just is the computer Revolution person no it's not really right like it's a cute unit if you check out my Twitter I think I put up a good tweet about you'll be doing for um and then Trump and Tropics is my name for the field um well if you say it's no it's definitely a revolution and nothing between the Industrial Revolution heroism this is a revolution okay so the Industrial Revolution did this to uh energy consumption and production right so this is this is the world's energy consumption um it's nice to see that it's still going up even if it's stagnated in some places which is just a great tragedy but um so this used to grow at a rate that was proportional to the number of people in the world what the Industrial Revolution unlocked and I'll also point something out about the Industrial Revolution that's kind of interesting it happened before a lot of people think it did right the period generally spanned about 1760 to 1840. notice how there was no uptick in energy usage until then okay so when you look at the computer Revolution um the computer revolution occurred in the Years okay so let's let's do some more stuff about this right Industrial Revolution was uh 1760 to 1840 the computer Revolution is what year was the Apple so all right maybe that was the beginning of it 1977. um to I mean now right so how many years is that 46 years all right so this is 80 years so I mean we have another if it's the same we have a bunch more years I guess I picked kind of an arbitrary date for the beginning of the computer Revolution I mean I'm gonna go back to eniac right 1945 under the war I don't know I mean we can talk about like deck machines and so what the computer Revolution or whatever you want to call it what it's going to unlock is you're going to see a curve like this go up for intelligence right so energy usage energy was okay before the Industrial Revolution energy usage was proportional it's not like proportional symbol for proportional I don't know how to actually draw that we'll just say we'll just you we'll just use that um in a computer Revolution uh pre the computer Revolution intelligence right so before the computer Revolution uh intelligence was roughly proportional to people and soon it won't be right um well the amount of Intelligence on the planet is about to Skyrocket but not as fast as like I heard Paul Cristiano say I think it's going to be slower than that um I mean we can we can actually like do the math out on this uh and work out like how many of the computers how many of the usable flops are produced every year it's probably only ten percent so you can work out the generation time like none of this is going to be fast right just like this this energy thing looks like this like it went up but it went up slowly right so I expect the same thing you know how much intelligence does the world have we're going to be looking at Future our world and data and we're going to be saying how much intelligence does the world have um so the recursive rapid intelligence explosion I do not believe this is possible this doesn't make any sense to me um and I think that once we have an understanding of the field of entropics uh it will be obvious why that's not true right um you know Caskey's going to bring up the nuclear or could have ignited the atmosphere of nitrogen I'll point out that it didn't the nuclear bomb did not destroy the world it actually had yields approximately exactly what the physicists were estimating right so I think that when we do build these very large super intelligent systems they're going to be pretty much exactly as intelligent as we predict uh you know with this with this new emerging field um so yeah right so hang on let me um like so so is intelligence more like the jewel or is intelligence more like the what hopefully you understand the difference right what is uh Jewelers energy a lot of energy per time so the flop what's what's kind of upsetting about the Flop is it's kind of both but um I guess like okay we have op and op per time uh so a person represents about 20 E15 Ops per second um then we want to get this back to back to an ah you can talk about something like the person here in the same way another unit we use for energy is the kilowatt hour right so what's a kilowatt hour well what's a kilowatt okay so it's a kilojoule per second times hour all right so second times hour uh that's like 2600 kilowatt Jewels equals kwh did I do that right one kwh to KJ yeah cool I mean this all right I think this is this is approximately this approximately corresponds to our intuitive like understanding intelligence right like if we want a problem solved um so how much intelligence do I need to be a 2000 ELO in chess so let's look at chess ELO over time uh uh no these are do we know this historically hmm okay so whatever it takes to be a 2000 ELO in chess um it was doable by a 1990 computer um so what's kind of interesting is I was looking at open ai's uh scaling thing and the amount of compute that went into Alpha zero was like not much at all it was like a person day of compute which corresponds with okay fine that thing plays chess really well but like like we got to 2000 a long time ago um can we just check how much compute they used for a 2K ELO model yeah I think so I mean what's cool about this question is like one of the one of the one of the like great questions and and I'm going to use the word in Tropics do we like it do we like that as the name of the field like one of the great questions is entropics in entropics is how close are we to Optimal right um so this is gonna come up in my debate and uh yukowski thinks that we are a long way away that these inscrutable matrices are just hopeless right like it's just it's just you have no idea uh we are nowhere near they are incredibly wasteful I think they're that wasteful like what is it is it is a real like question right okay so I think nobody doubts we're 10x right nobody doubts there's a 10x that's possible like another way to say this is we're going to find an algorithm that can do as well as gpt4 uh on the benchmarks with a tenth of the compute and so I think no one doubts we're going to find that algorithm but okay how about 100x how many X how about one e6x right if the answer turns out to be something like 1e10 right if we are um if we are one e10x off uh from optimal with software uh then we are potentially in a dangerous world because it's possible for something to like make that leap very quickly but I think even if we are I don't think it will make that leap very quickly I think that humans are very good programmers I am probably better at programming than I am at language I'm not that great at language uh you know programming I mean I know how good I am like compared to other people to programming is like pretty you know you can measure this pretty well I I have a few uh you know top finishes on Advent of code like it's it's and I don't think I'm a bad programmer I think my brain is actually pretty efficient at programming when I see how good um by the way I think gbt4 is an atrocious programmer uh I think gbt4 is not even meeting the bar of many Junior Engineers I've seen uh for how good it is as a programmer but yet like it writes essays pretty well it just turns out that like writing essays is in some optimal sort of way like easier than programming right um is that you wanna you wanna you wanna see if chat should be taking code uh oh you'll like this oh everyone we actually used to do things on stream and not just sit around and shit talk all right should we do you want to do Elite code and try to get gbt to do it um all right here is this one of these that gets like mad if I if I put the answers online ah okay stop generating uh below 10 that are multiples of three or five this is annoying copy is sum of all multiples of three or five below one thousand um I mean write a Python program to code interpreter run this oh my God you guys it's trying to get out guys is there a secret exploit hidden in here okay um is this code right it seems pretty right [Music] I've done most of these all right let's sign up [Music] cool well how far did I get oh I see because I solved the first page and then got lazy um okay let's see if it's right expected indent what okay should I do this in should I do this in a she's in an editor Cosley cook just trained on lead code yeah it's fully trained on Project Euler too interesting why aren't I using Code interpreter yeah I probably should wait so can code interpreter actually run code foreign all right cool like how many project Oilers can it solve did anyone do this hmm what does it fail at problem 11 largest product in a grid oh I mean that's fair you failed at 13. oh yeah interesting why couldn't it do problem 22. well that is ah yup okay it's over fit I mean that's not all right but it's over fit right because I what the hell is a name score yeah overfit on Project Oiler hmm all right let's not get off topic of entropics um so I mean these are harder things right so what is overfishing so one of the interesting things about overfitting is lossless compression cannot be over fat I was thinking about think about an auto encoder right and the autoencoder is you know what is a losses autocoder look like right this is a really nice streak taught me more about engineering than my undergrad yeah man thank you maybe college is a scam Maybe I I don't want to go off on this again but like I'm kind of starting to think that like a bunch of people got together in like the 60s or 70s and said uh let's not progress all right so what else explains this right okay I mean another thing that could potentially explain it is that energy usage is an s-curve okay they ended Google code Jam maybe because of jpts I mean we're gonna see a curve we're gonna see a curve very similar for intelligence right and you know can we name it the George hotz curve that's what that's what matters here right so I want to see I want to see that that energy production and consumption by the way this is America um like I think they've stopped progress in America I don't think they've managed to stop progress in the whole world um but I just I can't get over I can't get over fiat currency I I can't get over that like and I'm mad at you know I'm mad at my ancestors to this I inherited so much from the past and I I'm I'm so grateful to for the past but how did you not stop this train wreck how did you let our money become fake you know just it really upsets me um Club of Rome the limits of our growth I've never heard of this book interesting [Music] foreign further back no I want to look really far back yeah I know this is off topic from uh you don't see any particular discontinuity around this time can I get it further back I mean like just take the uh this books per year in the world population this is what these people have in mind for us you know I mean the Industrial Revolution did like shift this it seems I mean again I also like I'm not necessarily positing a conspiracy theory and a bunch of people did this behind the scenes right like we have very little understanding of how our government actually works right which is another field that is not studied um we have several Fields Okay so I you know I really hate bringing up there are examples of things that are like obviously true I'm not going to say I'm not going to give examples but there are examples of things that are true um but because they pertain to people because they pertain to like again they're things that that like the powers that be would prefer not to be true so science is very corrupted by a set of these views right there are things that are scientifically true that are either downplayed rejected or like you know look we don't have perfect evidence for this um I mean I I think that it's a very shoddy like truth finding Enterprise I why do I go off on these tangents I guess I go off on these tangents because I'm upset that these things aren't already very already done scientifically true but socially inconvenient yes yes there are some there are some there are some truths about this um I mean here let's give it let's give a let's give a hypothetical example that won't offend anyone um imagine you lived in a uh incredibly like a racist country right your country was super racist you kept like the population super homogeneous and uh you know you you believed that your race was Superior right let's say you're the green people right green people go green people green people are the best green people should inherit the earth but you started doing some studies and you found out that the red people yeah I mean the red people they're they're your your your theories about your racial Supremacy weren't correct so what would the government of the green people do what would the government of the green people do if they found out that red people were actually better right would they Embrace this would they be like the green people seek truth or would they come up with you know fake science to be pro-green people no this is not it's not an analogy it's just like like that's the obvious like one I could think of right um but I mean there's a chance that this goes yeah a lot sort of deeper than like what happened to the universities what happened they're destroyed did this like is it just something that they couldn't stand up to competition from the internet I mean this is possible maybe these organizations were never actually truth seeking organizations to begin with new reaction has a bunch of it mentioned small bug is a bunch of interesting answers to this stuff um but yeah it's Neo reaction is uh big on pros and light on light on like okay well this is when this happened this is why um you know have you guys ever seen Wiki spooks uh I found this website it's kind of interesting um you know again whenever you get into whenever you get into uh conspiracy theory kind of stuff there is a lot of conspiracy theories that are just absolutely fake um as far as I can tell pizzagate did not happen uh I have a I have a post on my blog um called uh uh the new regime no not the new regime which one um the fourth estate yeah um this is this is I think one of my better blog posts people have sent me emails privately uh praising this ones uh regardless of your opinion on Trump became obvious in those years there's a machine behind the scenes in our government and okay how does this relate to in tropics I mean why is some random guy on a twitch stream like proposing this I went on Twitter and I like I asked about this right like so I don't think I'm this is a real thing and there's almost no science that answers it you'll notice that there's also no science for a few other things there's no science that explains like I you know look I've run a company for the last uh I'm a lot less Hands-On now but I've run a company for the last six seven years and I don't understand right we're 20 people and we built this how how is it that I see this company started around a similar time to comma um they raised hilariously more money right there is 207 million dollars and I promise what they have is nowhere near as advanced as that I don't understand like I would accept in general when you see a world and when you see a world and like there's just stuff that doesn't make sense to you right like it's because you don't understand something but once and I believe this for the longest time I believe for the longest time that it was like because you have to believe that right you have to start with a very strong prior saying you're the mean right and and whatever it is there's a reason that these companies end up you know George there has to be something you don't understand and here we are seven years later and I still don't understand what that is to give the many other people in the world a purpose yeah but like who look I mean this is prep for if it is true if it is true that there are some collective dumbness and human flops are being used so terribly I'm trying look I'm trying to like then you'dkowski's position might be right right his position might be that it turns out the machines actually will just be so much more efficient than us and blow past us um I don't know I want it all to make sense you know and I'm not I'm not crazy right I think you know I'll I'll right um if you haven't read this go read it right this is the Unabomber Manifesto um hopefully most people on my channel have read it uh during his trial um he wanted very much not to be declared insane and I think he actually wasn't something about like insanity gets you out of the death penalty or something um I think the FBI referred to this Manifesto as rambling nonsense uh this Manifesto is one of the clearests documents I've ever read I don't agree with it I don't agree with the document I especially don't agree with the document's conclusion but it is very clear in what it says and maybe this is the great sort of like if everybody reflected a little bit too much on themselves then we'd end up here and we have to confront this Manifesto and we do have to confront this Manifesto rest in peace um no look I mean the man was also a terrorist and I I don't think I don't think he had to be like I don't think you know um but the Industrial Revolution its consequences have been a disaster for the human race they have greatly increased the life expectancy of those of us who live in advanced countries but they have destabilized Society have made life unfulfilling have subjected human beings to indignities how are we on the Unabomber Manifesto right how do we go on stream and we end up here crazy and if so what what sort of crazy am I schizophrenic am I bipolar like I think I have a fairly Cur how scary is it if it turns out that your model of reality actually is more correct right but here's the problem every single crazy person thinks that right every single person who is who is schizophrenic thinks this his Solutions and conclusions are definitely not the way forward at all um again his Solutions and conclusions look like you know more stupid terrorism um basically and and you know uh it's not going to get you anywhere uh I just get easily uh distracted by chat um no this isn't getting distracted by chat this is asking like scarier questions about Society right like I went into this um I went into this debate prep uh Elias at your Caskey wrote this in time uh pausing AI developments is not enough we need to shut it all down I went into this debate prep thinking that I was absolutely just gonna clown this document and there's many ways I can clown this document all right there's many ways I can just sort of like I was like okay let's use debate tactics let's actually win um and then I started thinking about it more and I was like no I don't want to win the debate that badly you know I'm a little mad I lost the Conor like I look I don't know if I lost but I didn't play it the best right I I didn't play it the best I actually went in that debate for more of a sort of like industrial society and its future angle right and that's how I ended up Somalia um look look I I love Terry Davis I've watched a bunch of his streams uh I do not think that he produced I think he actually might have been I'm not gonna say crazy but you know he was like not Temple OS is not the future of operating systems um yeah no I mean you guys know that I think AI is very dangerous but my threat models don't look like uh you know they take the atoms and use them for something else they look a lot more like the Hypno drones or the infinite Tick Tock right oh his cycle a Manifesto a psychological analysis of leftists I think it's dead on I think it's dead on when he when he describes leftists as over socialized um I think it's it's dead on I think that you can talk about one of the problems in society today is like an overproduction of Elites uh Holy See is uh because it's not going to take over the world I have tried I have tried look I you know you don't have turned programming languages um so you know I started this debate prep and then uh what is this line um how do you know what you know when you know it or something like that about rationality and like I'm so confident in what I believe I'm still confident and there is no there's not going to be a foom there is no seat AI there is there is the intelligence explosion won't happen but like what will happen society's incredibly dishonest and this is this is what's starting to scare me more right so if you have a society that's very dishonest well what do you teach the machines like I mean I guess you come to the same question of like okay what is the loss function for society do we like this loss function we're going to have to answer these questions way sooner like I'm gonna quote myself I'm gonna quote myself I uh no no no this this this goes this goes even further back this world does Google work anymore there's a mic Solana Singularity power over people I don't know some quote I said 2015 and basically said if we hit the singularity and I I said the word Singularity I don't even really believe in the singularity if we continue like doing what we're doing we're gonna die I know I'm supposed to be the non-doomer side of this but like Psy is about to inherit Untold power okay Destiny once said I sometimes feel like democracy is doing a really good job at solving all the easy problems now we're just left with the hard ones and I don't think Society is capable of solving them I don't even think they're problems everybody just needs to stop lying if tomorrow everybody woke up and just stopped lying and really really searched inside themselves and accepted that the world is going to suck so much if you continue to do what you're doing like would you rather die is your sham identity worth dying over I don't know but it upsets me oops that's me if tomorrow everyone stopped lying the economy would collapse pretty hard good we'll get some honesty if the news is fake imagine history this exploration and this debate prep led me to a dark place right if we can all play around with the science and it's cool and like I'm interested in this and like we'll see we'll see how the debate goes on on Tuesday I think we're dead not for the same reasons you think we're dead but I think we're dead like I'm I'm a Doomer you know I'm an AI Doomer it's not the AI it's not the AI the AI is not going to have an intelligence explosion overnight make a sharp left turn and synthesize Diamond Nanobots this isn't going to happen this is a b this is a bad sci-fi story I know I know I don't know suddenly [Music] ah how come I can't how come I can't find this the internet converges to truth I mean all right let's engage with it honestly let's let's see some of this stuff's a little bit like I mean I guess I think about like like recursive self-improving AI that steals our atoms as like an ultra left position and then you can think of like thermodynamic God as an ultra right position I haven't actually really engaged with this stuff I mean there's like effective accelerationism light which is like oh yes we should fix San Francisco we should use more energy yeah no I mean we should use more energy that's not a joke and fixing San Francisco well shit man I think building nuclear power plants is easier um well here I mean this is okay I I look I have not honestly truly engaged with this laughs tells us the universe exponentially favors Futures where matter like I don't know this stuff well I don't know if he's eacc is a joke I have not I I saw this like this is pretty old now like these are the OGE ACC guys um like I I don't even know if this is true no see like this is where you like lose me with this stuff right like I don't know what the hell this word means I hate this word like I don't believe I'm conscious but I do think there are some like I don't know like look you could put people on a spectrum of like yukowski and then like hardcore thermodynamic eacc based bath and then like you have like Robin Hansen and then you have Paul Cristiano right um you have this like Spectrum right like Paul Cristiano's on like the the left but not that I'm thinking of this left versus right it's not like a political Spectrum I just I don't know why I think of like this is right and then and like like Singleton doomerism is Left Right like Singleton doomerism and then like gray goo is good embrace the goo but like you know to really engage with this stuff um like we're all gonna die with Ellie either casket I thought this episode was was was both ridiculous and depressing um I mean I think that some of the leaps are just crazy I I you know I was surprised to see Robin Hansen in the comments like I would like to thank Robin Hansen for clearing all my doubts on the possibility of humanity surviving AI now I'm certain we're all coming to time I'm not entirely persuaded by a laser argument but after listening to this for a few minutes I I listened to them both and I thought Robin Hansen made far better points [Music] um and like I mean I guess okay here's how he died okay so well let's start with how we don't die this is all my debate prep um so you know we'll start with how we don't die um machines are uh human level machines are introduced at a standard uh human rate and this this has gone up and down throughout history right you can have the seven children you can have the declining birth rates right um machines uh don't out compete uh humans as a lump right uh capabilities are mixed right um better at adding uh worse at Plumbing right and we already lived this world today so I see this all kind of continuing right um you know uh alignment proves to be very similar to aligning humans uh it actually turns out that I think this is one of the hilarious things the rationalists get wrong you do not align humans because they are good people you align humans because they have more incentive to press cooperate then press defect right you just have to do the same thing with machines the same laws apply to them right like like machine you know I I think I think Robin Hansen kind of like alluded to this like the machine's not gonna steal my atoms stealing atoms is not a good way to get atoms a much better way to get atoms is to buy them oh yeah but the machine's cheap like no it's not maybe it'll steal the money right stealing the money and buying the atoms is probably easier than stealing the atoms it's actually probably even easier to earn the money right like you're a super intelligent you just earn the money right you know don't steal my atoms buy my atoms um not up to udkowski level you need more time and ideas oh okay okay um how we die okay how we die um meeting better super intelligence right um yeah if this somehow happens we're dead right so there's a few ways it could happen um one is aliens show up right aliens show up you'd figure they're probably super intelligent says I mean they showed up right people will steal my atoms to sell to the AI no they won't bro cause I got AI myself you Tiny Box You're Gonna Keep Me safe right my tiny box is Gonna Keep Me safe and then like middle expected many wire heads right that's not everyone dying wire heading's not gonna get everybody it's not really uh um many psyops many wire heads right uh there's no getting around psyops and wire fence right um we'll just put advertising advert ising advertising oh yo if you guys have never seen this um uh Skittles instead of a Super Bowl ad one year uh put on a Skittles commercial uh and it has this great song in it which I won't play because of copyright but check out Skittles commercial the musical advertising ruins everything many wire heads uh is uh Fenton I will just say opiates because I don't know how to spell fentanyl all right cool um so you know those are just predicting what exists right now advertising and extrapolating it out into the future where you have scary AI deep fake advertising scary where you're an individualized cohort and yeah um and then the opiates it's like well you know you're gonna get better opiates future opiates opiates with no hangover cheap opiates opiates that are implanted in your skull math you want math math um is the Golden Age by John C right I don't know this one uh Utopia is of course impossible no no it's pretty good okay so how do we meet uh 10 uh one ex 10 better super intelligence right um you don't want the prime minister no no no no no the prime intellect world is a dystopia right finish that story and ask yourself what really happened in the end it didn't even occur to me you know when I first read the story I don't know how the author intended it but read metamorphosis is a prime intellect and ask yourself what really happened at the end and when I was 15 and I was naive and hopeful and read that story I was like wow okay and then when I realized what actually happened I'm like okay okay um does hard take off equal death uh yes yes hard to take off his death um hard takeoff like in the matter of days or something right uh if there's really like a hard takeoff yeah yeah we're dead um or Society breaks Society uh no actually Society is way more inefficient than we think um rapid rapid outcompete even sure about that one that's how we die I'm not actually sure about this one I don't know where to put it like no I mean the ants thing is I don't know maybe this is just me being mad about Society right like what is it why does it not make sense I'm 33 I'm not crazy why does society not make sense it's not Malik I don't think it's Malik okay maybe it's Mom maybe it's Mark [Music] um I'm not going to go into exactly what my Avenues of attack are I do have every use of attack I do have arguments that I have prepared um the hard takeoff with diamond Nanobots is not fucking happening don't worry if you're worried about that I wouldn't it's just hard you know all right why do I expect Society to make sense hey we're gonna open it up to everybody else I'm gonna ask some questions and I don't know if these questions are going to get us anywhere but we're going to ask him anyway does society make sense for most of you are you outside the norm we have 452 people in here honestly yes it makes sense but that doesn't mean I like the way it works like you found an efficient way to use the norm do we have my poll this was another like I remember when I tried to buy land yeah uh can you have the laundry basket I have some laundry in it you can come today you get them on stream though come and take it let's say having switches [Music] I don't know they're closed you miss Alex they miss you Alex said I'm not allowed to rant about AI to her anymore today so I'm rounding to you guys we're not super surprised at the way things are cultures Downstream from politics I think Breitbart said it the other way no I don't tell them about tub land I don't get to know things like that about my life Alex I have to I have to maintain a facade of being a crazy person online if they knew how like normal I was no one would respect me and everyone would stop following my stream I understand what here what what my backpack I did show them my headphones yeah I should have did you try them out no we're preparing for the debate though this is like like live crap like am I giving away all my Avenues of attack I don't know man I believe in open source AI um did you learn anything did you come up with any good strategies wait Dobby oh wow thank you for gifting Subs Mad Dog Nation wow that might be the biggest sub gift in history he gifted a hundred Subs that's awesome thank you I know thank you good more chicken tender funds money the power of Alice they did it for you Alex [Music] Mad Dog Nation Malik is defeated they say thank you for being patient with George we hung our TV on the wall we're very happy about that really could they hear the banging no I don't think so no I was banging on the table I brought the uniform manifest so I got very upset what a scam Society is a regular complaint from you it's a scam are we done are you done with the Stream I don't know if they want more straight give them more strain but I think we're I think we're we're Mad Dog Nation okay maybe not everyone that's the thing most people I meet are really nice why does society suck what is that what is that what is that it says Randall from Clarks I hate people but I love gatherings [Music] do you want more stream you up tedious one you missed the Unabomber random sorry let's talk more about Society I don't know I don't really have anything else to say Alex am I crazy oh person you sure what if I'm schizophrenic bipolar s diagnosing anyone I'm not an armchair doctor being able to think largely free of ideology seems very rare today no I'm a Libertarian you don't understand I have an ideology my door handle is broken well we should move to a nice apartment that has good doors a fortune to have this man assembled you went on Fortune what how much was wardrobe assembly 200 an hour or four hours wait are you kidding oh my God I would have assembled the Wardrobe for two for 150 an hour you know yeah that's reasonable it's insane how much does it cost to run a gbt for an hour how about 500 of that 20 something plants I mean that's only like 25 dollars a plant I know but then I asked my mom who plays for gardeners all the time yeah but she's she's weird you could get you know 150 bucks Alex you can pay 150 bucks too just take the chocolate on a Lemon Grove and you know say trabajo if you're good oh hey Chris out of control the machines don't come faster Cinco siento pesos [Music] you don't want to no big wackos are gonna show up man no they're gonna ask me they're gonna ask questions I'm going to make sure they write the questions to ask him first um are you real George Alex rocket 420 I am real um have you ever seen Kanye and Geo crazy whoa whoa I'm not I'm not that far out man I love Kanye I think he's going through some some stuff and I'm not saying like he's going through some mental health stuff I think he's just going through some stuff and like I hope he pulls out of it makes some new good music like I believe in him uh divorce is hard man yo it was yeah oh HBO Max HBO Max has a Kim Kanye thing it's okay I wouldn't recommend Alex wouldn't recommend that you made me sound like Drake yo we just merged oh you're the sovitz guy yeah I owe you I owe you 200 bucks send me out I'll uh I'll pay you Tiny Box is the future fuck Google fuck why don't fuck Mark Andreessen man what Mark injuries I mean look Google look Google's going through some rough times and Sam Altman you know Sam Hunt man here's what he is he can't just front Sam Allman that's right I mean that's my take on Sam Allman right nice guy um are you done am I done what no Sam off is a bad topic now you know what I'm Banning Sam Altman that's a bad word I agree it's a bad word yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Mark seems worse than Sam curious why you think that yeah this is this is shit talking and we don't need to talk about people you know that's true that's true that's true that's true that's true don't people talk about people mediocre people talk about ideas and Geniuses talk about next level conspiracy theories Lizard Man Blizzard Man the world is made up of 99 good people doing their best I don't believe this actually you are one of those good people for for gifting Subs but I actually don't believe that because I did a poll on this stream no no no no no no no where is my pole so you're watching your own stream on stream yeah I know oh here we go um we asked a question um and by the way I just want to say that this came out before Taylor Swift released anti-hero so she stole this from me can I switched all this for me I did a poll and the question was are you the problem I argue the problem no but I'm kind of apathetic to the problem yes but insert excuse here uh no and I spent a lot of time fighting the problem and then Taylor Swift released a song called anti-hero where she had the lyric it's me hi I'm the problem it's me she acknowledged it Taylor Swift's in the 33 I don't really think she's in the problem though the problem I think she's sarcastically acknowledged it because I love Taylor Swift and Taylor Swift I'm cool with you stealing my you're the problem but I want a day like a nice ticket I'm only standing like the front man you don't gotta meet me I'm not trying to be weird like that or anything just like send me a nice ticket be like thanks George I'm never gonna acknowledge publicly XOXO Taylor oh you're not the guy that made that PR okay I don't owe you 200 then see what this link is it's okay it has six views uh Portnoy is that Port noise complaint I only know that from BoJack Horseman I've never actually seen it Society evolved so we may be going backwards Taylor Swift is propping up the economy that's true I've lost some Taylor Swift tickets I might even buy them wait yodkowski is definitely a guy doing his best absolutely absolutely um this is not I would not debate someone who I did not believe held good faith like was a good faith intellectual ah okay that's right that's right Chicken Man foreign for some reason this chicken man looks less evil than the other Chicken Man aha we found him I think this might be a different chicken man but that is chicken man you know again trippy uh we weren't going to engage more seriously with the eacc stuff I mean I think this is true I like this actually huh I mean uh so this is a psycho history uh oh yeah it's I don't know it's actually a real thing but it's in it's in Foundation it's pretty cool um so like I wonder I mean like what is the the like it's funny like you know I come within tropics and I start thinking about like psycho history right you missed stuff's true if anyone wants to pay me not to develop AGI fuck you I'm gonna do it anyway so I was not a bad guy all right we're going to space cool I have read this and I agree with most of it I just I don't like the word Consciousness to turn off to me I don't think it's real stop fighting thermodynamic will of the universe no it's copyrighted and we can't listen to it no we sang songs we never learned your words or melodies and we ran Far Beyond the Lights cast on these streets days and tired we're still standing always anxious somehow breathing never searching but still searching for you park your car out on the lawn and came inside I'm shaking off this sinking feeling in my gut and I am screaming see me a burning man next year I've been to Burning Man in a while the police might have stayed okay right um you know the U.S wants to sabotage tsmc I don't know what is it about Chad and maybe this means I can't stream anymore what is it about chat that always derails like when I'm not here I'm thinking about nice stuff like we're gonna do some like okay like let's look into like a mathematical theory for computation social media is making us all dumber wow what if smartphones aren't making us smarter um Humanity had a great run guys now we're not gonna die I don't think we're gonna die come on it's gonna suck balls but we're not gonna die how's the AI gonna kill us and don't say diamond Nanobots we're all sad di Jones well sad DJs but some of us had a problem and Tropics doesn't imply whether or not we're doomed I don't know about that uh uh but simulation Theory does simulation Theory implies we're not going to die in a stupid way because then this video game would get a low rating well I played for a while played all the farming and Industry stuff Great Tech tree right up until random AGI made a sharp left turn and killed us all wow that game sucked man GG bro see and then no one would play the game again and then we wouldn't be here okay do you understand we're here right we are here given that we are here this must be a good video game because bad video games don't get played much we could just be unlucky but assuming we're not unlucky we're in a good video game and a good video game has a good Tech progression so therefore Society has a good Tech progression and clearly clearly their Tech progression must have been good and that's what they modeled it off of because they got to the point where they built simulations right and by they I mean God and the up there and you know what I'm saying right why does the guy who develop this game not care about talking to us he did have you not heard about Moses in the burning bush and he sent his only son to die for our sins guys bad dog Nation thanks for gifting Subs please read the preface of the mind is Flash shallowness of the improvising brain oh this reminds me of I really like uh Robin Hansen has a similar book I think elephant in the brain preface I'm gonna get a preface yeah system one and two we're thinking fast and slow um you're curious about my view of the portal the idea the Bible is the closest we can come to a mankind origin story I mean yeah I wrote the that's the gardener you're getting good answers I wrote The Garden of Eden blog post um I mean I think so right do you have a better origin story for Humanity people worried AGI will cause Extinction it's like it's not the will of the machine okay it's the will of other people that will kill you I mean yeah like this is a portal [Music] yo okay like how close are we to Optimal usage of compute for intelligence this like if there's any question that motivates the study of entropics it's this in my debate I'm gonna make a bunch of hand wavy claims they're not that hand wavy I kind of ground them and stuff but if it turns out the answer to this is this uh GG boys now that that's probably not even enough if the answer is this it's GG boys if that turns out to be the answer [Music] oh Mad Dog Nation you must be rich should I do one of those should I do one of those streams should I do one of those streams where I uh where I eat the ice cream or something I'd have to like practice it ice cream ice cream ice cream ice cream um prologue uh I'll bring up the I'm gonna bring up the the the uh the Bible one on the hero's journey wow and we did it we need the tiny Corporation though I want to like I want to start reproducing a lot of the papers we are going to study on tropics we are going to figure out how to get the most intelligence perjoule because that's where things get interesting like supercomputers are going to hit power limits you know this right we don't have enough power in the world I don't know how close we are to having enough power in the world here's a question here's a question that somebody can can actually go and figure out right now I'll be right back we have some real questions we have some real questions these are real questions and I challenge someone in this chat today to turn their life around and do research spend 50 hours and research the questions I'm about to propose they're questions you can find answers to and they're questions that are determine what happens to humans foreign if you do a good job with this stuff I'll hire you with the tiny Corp to be an entropic researcher okay questions how many silicon flops exist in the world let's see if chat gbt can do it man I love GT4 you guys know this story by the way if you haven't read the story if you have not read the last question um you know uh you ask multivac I dare you five dollars said it can't be done right so the the story is them basically asking a computer what the fate of their civilization is gonna be oh it's using python whoa okay well that's several things off from what Google bard said and that's why I think that's a lot closer to this is sick [Music] not at the end of last year I was so unimpressed by it I'm like oh this is garbage it's gonna take him so long to make a good one wow that's doing all the cloud ones okay so how many people is that never mind I don't need a researcher I'm not hiring nobody I got my boy here you know what every bad thing I ever said about Sam Altman I take it back this thing's fucking awesome oh wait no no sorry that's that's I asked you that question already [Music] so I'm almost into doing video driver okay never mind it broke people xai yeah I'm unimpressed with all the rappers okay so if you read my my blog post about a big computer I want to make a zetaflop computer right like I want to own one zetaflop um so actually we can we can ask some interesting questions so GPT uh four was trained on a cluster of 25 000 gpus also people think I have some how to get this I literally read this on Reddit like this isn't secret Alpha I read it on Reddit um so it's that many teraflops so that many Peta flops so 7.8 exit flops okay that's like nothing is that really right I can just do that all right this is useless garbage I love this this code interpreter thing is so good that it just writes programs like I was trying to use it I think I do kind of think I have been like using it a bit wrong um whatever I try to use it to help me with my actual programming but how many things in life do I just like I could code this I just don't want to waste 10 minutes people have told me this yeah yeah I know I know I know okay so what's that growth rate all right so how fast is the computer civilization growing 25 per year yeah um that's a lot it's not nerfed I don't know why you guys think it's nerfed foreign 21 gigawatts foreign this is just asking the question of like what's actually going to happen in our society uh foreign okay those are sustainable numbers I tried I've tried to get into Nick land I got like I can't engage more with this stuff because I think these people have some cool stuff figured out I just like I don't quite understand it maybe maybe like again you know that that thing they link to with some Physics principle from 1992 right like my physics knowledge ends at the okay if you push me we can go to the beginning of the 20th century if you really push me um oh you found the prologue the more your reals that Anne Rand have all right I wouldn't go that far though I have found we'll save that one for the debate uh uh spoiler alert uh no I yeah I I think I I relativity in quantum I'm a fine artist guys you know I have limits um philosophy objective oh qm makes a lot of sense as far as what's going on I've tried a few times to engage with it I I think more it's not that I like don't it's not that I can't understand quantum mechanics um well like how far do you go with quantum mechanics okay do you go like would you say you understand like Quantum field Theory like I've tried to like like push into this and it turns out we do understand now like where electrons come from like we have this model like we have this model of these Quantum fields and the electron can be modeled as like a perturbation in the quantum fields the problem I actually the reason I didn't like like learn it more um was because yeah I didn't understand what yeah I think people are linking this I don't exactly understand this and get to this at some point but okay um yeah oh yeah yeah yeah dude dude like wait I I totally agree with this do I remember that yeah vaguely you haven't caught me off guard I I didn't know what to say well do you think that's the thing I don't think I believe in deep denim I kind of think all you are is just the things that you do right I mean it's the same idea right I don't think I believe in deep down and I agree you know I if you guys haven't watched this show like BoJack Horseman is the new like like the show affected my life way more than I thought um I probably watched it through about five times now again it's lines like that I think I think that that is exactly what that prologue gets to like I don't think I believe in deep down yeah I mean I say this was I say this with self-driving cars too like people have this idea that like what are we gonna do when a self-driving car gets into an accident how are you going to deal with the inscrutable matrices how do you deal with humans you ask them you try to ask a human why they got into a car accident it doesn't work well you're like wait you have a dash cam oh oh this is great I'm not gonna waste my time talking to you right did I like Avatar only the first one don't get me started on Avatar um okay so flop score 25 per year get ready for some immigration boys and I think we can actually sustain that power growth Joe Pera I heard of this oh is it communion wait I do like this this is good wait holy shit can we fix this you guys you know how much hate I got for Twitter you know I got so much hate for that and there's a whole bunch of you know like there's no there's no simple explanation right to like like but one of my hopes was that we could build a better social network one of my hopes is that we could actually have conversations about what makes social networks good in the right sort of world like I was down to like actually fix Twitter it wasn't what I thought it would be thank you thank you for gifting subs thank you damn why not make some money off of uh off of twitch this month um don't you don't have to give some if you're not rich if you're rich whatever man you know you do you but uh uh I do appreciate it but I'm glad that you know you know what I'm doing is appreciate it um let's fix Society I don't think I can fix this Society some people are so rich all they have is money oh I mean yeah no shit my obvi like people think that that was like some like like controversial statement that like Twitter can be run with fewer people oh my God like how is that remotely controversial most of Twitter there's a few things on the ads that don't scale that well but for like the all the core infrastructure parts of Twitter we could repurpose Commodore on Twitter like it's just not that hard check out far Caster if I care about better social what are they doing that's different oh fuck this man no no no no thumbs down no anything that's web3 sucks balls okay does it have a fucking token right like does it have a token oh oh [Music] no token it's not okay look if there's no token I will engage with it a little bit but if there's a token immediately I lose all respect for any project that has a token okay if you have a token you have jumped the shark is there a Dao please tell me there's no doubt and no token if there's no doubt no token if it's actually just a protocol like email then it's fine but no this isn't the problem actually I mean it does feel like the internet is minimizing entropy wow this is a little okay yeah but I mean these are real questions we can ask why does it feel like Reddit is the last place that has any sort of entropy left okay everyone loved that book everyone loved that book do I have to read it I have not read it well at the beginning of infinity everyone everyone's been chilling for this book we'll buy it all right all right we'll read this book give the title kept me from reading it too foreign it over here be here Tuesday sounds good I gotta book a flight I'll do that tomorrow I guess ordered with the books a thousand pages and it could be a blog post no no I hate that no I'll buy the book I like holding the book um I'm halfway through uh I'm not gonna tell you what I'm reading because you guys explode for me um it's a thousand Pages saying limits are computation oh you never said the question no sorry too late gpg did them I mean it's just it says this it's this sort of it's this sort of analysis right but actually wait that just like she looks like totally reasonable and that was the first thing that I used gbd for and I'm like wow okay I actually would have wasted like an hour doing that the dust Theory like in permutation City sure they're meaning from something else yeah yeah yeah yeah it's surprises today he's a great fuck what do these numbers tell me I mean this is a plausible growth number right so what this is basically saying is we can enter an error where you know economy grows at 25 per year right do you see carpathy sweet about flops and dollars right um and this is a very plausible number so whenever I see numbers like this I'm just kind of reassured that it's lightweight this is actually all going to just be fine like what do these numbers tell me they tell me the economy is going to grow it yeah how is that crashing though nothing crashing this is gonna be fine and it's going to take it takes so long to build up to that number like we'll get there foreign get the electricity no it's not that much it's not that much growth for electricity we need more nuclear yes we do everyone kind of knows this is the CIA decides to destroy tsmc I don't know about that there is no rapid recursive self-improvement this is a myth I see no reason why rapid recursive self-improvement is possible at all oh Fred can Gates oh this is how we get into yeah yeah a reversible Computing has been brought up to me a bit in the last couple days um only slow self-improvement as possible well no it can be arbitrarily fast but we're going to enter a regime where it gets faster but it still doesn't happen overnight right like we might enter a regime where growth actually starts to happen 10x faster than it happens today meaning instead of doubling what um so all right uh uh let's post the same thing let's really go if if chat MBT gives me an answer here ah see so much better I wish it was just faster okay cool yeah so okay now it doubles in 35 years so it'll double in in three years instead wait this is just gonna be fucking awesome like that's three years it doubles every three years is actually like a really exciting growth rate it's not scary like if if the economy doubled every day we would all be terrified right like it would just be it would just be so scary there'd just be so much noise it'd be so impossible to do anything I mean we're already like feeling like that today I'm already feeling like it's so hard to commit to do anything because there's like so much Alpha everywhere you do the same chat about flops and yeah okay what's whatever it's 10x awful cast doesn't matter where does Humanity allocate the compute well definitely we need to put a lot of it in diversity and inclusion okay we can't neglect diversity and inclusion it's our most important strength and we'll have to make sure we devote a lot of flops to that but don't worry we'll still have 10 of the flops left over for doing flopping we invented a new Authority for brainwashing I don't know foreign okay I got a little too abstract for it it's not gbt5 um actually here's another interesting Factor right so if only this many exaflops were used to train gbt4 okay that's not that far off okay so that's 1.3 percent of the compute produced in the air this is definitely going to go up to 10 percent oh can we work out how long you got to wait until you can do GPT 4 level inference on your box at home well your computer or a tiny box right so a tiny box is going to get you a 10x over your computer you can pay your computer is probably about fifteen hundred dollars you can buy a tiny box for 15K there's a prototype over there tiny five um they do not publicly release the bullshit I promise you they publicly released the best version they possibly could okay I paid 20 a month for chat GPT I would not pay 20 a month for gbt3 garbage I paid 20 a month for gbt4 strategy behind hundred dollar pre-order we'll see what they will see what interest is right it just turned out to be pretty high I mean I don't know my conversion rate's gonna be could be anywhere from 10 to 80 percent I'd be like unsurprised kind of both ways Bard is free and good enough I haven't even used bard do I have to log in of course I have to log in fuck you Google I use board because I'm poor no I mean like you gotta respect look you gotta respect you gotta respect gpt4 I've come to respect it a lot more since I've been using it lately like it really is the first one where I see the you guys get a good line on one of his podcasts where he's like if gpd3 was a champ gpt4 is a human and I I kind of feel that llama two with code interpreter might do 80 of gbt4 the big llamas are the big llamas are better than three I don't know I was pretty impressed with this I thought all of its assumptions were like within an order of magnitude it thought about the same classes I thought about when I worked on this problem before all right guys got things to do tonight they don't sit here and talk to you as much as I love talking to you uh Mad Dog Nation thank you for gifting Subs you are the new record holder uh for my channel I appreciate you um I appreciate everyone else who subbed uh uh we're gonna get they don't give us the crumbs stop that you're not even a subscriber you don't get an opinion uh thanks for watching my stream tonight um these two streams are kind of meant to be put together so they can be put together one video um the whole the whole welcome to the new field of entropics um I will accept a different name if someone wants to call it something else but I want to answer the questions how much intelligence do I need to be a 2011 chest right like I want to answer that I want to answer that question fundamentally right like these are really interesting questions how much compute what's the minimum compute you need and this question determines whether we're dying from hard takeoff or not if we turn out to be a factor of a thousand off it doesn't matter if we turn out to be a factor of a billion off we might be dead so Food For Thought think about whether you're dead or not um come watch my debate on Tuesday uh Sparks will fly we'll discuss this stuff we'll figure out if you're going to die or not um and then if you are going to die I do ask how what changes you're going to make in your life right spend more time with your with your loved ones uh you know remember that scene in Fight Club that guy's gonna go on to have the best day of his life uh so you know what maybe we're gonna die um maybe We're Not Gonna Die I don't think we're gonna die it's like I don't know I just don't think we're gonna die I think that the AI is gonna liberate us and set us free in ways that we can only imagine now you know um you know what time the long run a song about the singularity it's called watch the world I watch The Smoke as it grew darker and blew up through the roof I watched the FED who sobbed in panic as the fire grew I saw Virginia get rid of Langley and its secrets to I held your hand and sat there knowing that we'd make it through I saw this man dispose of hunger and soap operas too I saw this field That Grew Perfection full of things you do I saw this box get rid of heartache and cure cancer too when I awoke I sat there hoping this is what we do it's a song about the singularity thank you thank you thank you good night everybody thank you for watching"
