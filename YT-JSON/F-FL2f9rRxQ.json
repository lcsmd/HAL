        "transcript": "Microsoft just made a big move in the AI World by shrinking powerful AI down to fit right in your pocket with the 53 mini and I mean that literally this little Powerhouse can run on your iPhone 14 bringing Advanced AI capabilities without compromising your privacy it's a GameChanger for anyone looking to use advanced technology simply and securely in the past developing AI meant creating bigger and more complex systems with some of the latest models having trillions of parameters these large models are powerhouses of computing and have been able to perform complicated tasks that are similar to how humans understand and reason but these big models need a lot of computing power and storage usually requiring strong cloud-based systems to work now with 53 mini there's a change this model fits an advanced AI right in your hand literally it has 3.8 billion parameters and was trained on 3.3 trillion tokens making it as good as much larger models like Mixr 8x7 B and even GPT 3.5 what's even more impressive is that it can be used on regular Smartphones without needing extra Computing help one of the major breakthroughs with this model is how carefully its training data has been upgraded instead of just making the model bigger Microsoft put a lot of effort into improving the quality and usefulness of the data it learns from during the training they understood that having better data not just more of it is key to making the model work better especially when they have to use smaller Compu computer systems 53 mini came about by making the data set it learns from bigger and better than the one its older version f 2 used this new data set includes carefully chosen web data and synthetic data created by other language models this doesn't just ensure the data is top-notch but it also greatly improves the model's ability to understand and create text that sounds like it was written by a human now the 53 Mini model is built using a Transformer decoder which is a key part of many modern language models and it has a default context length of 4K this means that even though it's a smaller model it is still able to handle a wide and deep range of information during discussions or when analyzing data Additionally the model is designed to be helpful to the open-source community and to work well with other systems it has a similar structure to the Llama 2 model and uses the same tokenizer which recognizes a vocabulary of 32,610 skills and tools with 53 mini without having to start from scratch one of the coolest things about 53 mini is that it can run right on your iPhone 14 thanks to the smart way it's built it can be squeezed down to Just 4 bits and still only take up about 1.8 GB of space and even with its small size it works really well it can create more than 12 tokens per second while running directly on the iPhone's a16 bionic chip without needing any internet connection what this means is pretty huge you can use some really Advanced AI features anytime you want without having to be online this keeps your information private and everything runs super fast when it comes to how well it performs 53 mini has really shown its strength in both in-house and outside tests it scores just as well as bigger models do on well-known AI tests like M mlu and Mt bench this demonstrates not only the efficiency of its architecture but also the effectiveness of its training regimen which was meticulously crafted to maximize the models learning from its enhanced data set now When developing this they also tried out larger versions of the model called 53 small and 53 medium which have 7 billion and 14 billion parameters respectively these bigger models were trained using the same highquality data but for a longer time totaling 4.8 trillion tokens the results from these models were actually really good showing major improvements in their abilities as they got bigger for instance the 53 small and 53 medium scored even higher on the mlu an Mt bench test proving that making the models bigger can be very effective without using more data than necessary but the way they trained the 53 mini was different from the usual method of just making models bigger and using more computing power the training process started with using web sources to teach the model general knowledge and how to understand language then it moved to a stage where it combined even more carefully chosen web data with synthetic data focused on logical thinking and specialized skills this care step-by-step approach helped the model perform really well without just making it bigger in training the model they also made use of the latest AI research including new ways of breaking down text into tokens and focusing the model's attention for example the 53 small model uses a tokenizer called tick token to handle multiple languages better showing Microsoft's commitment to improving how the model Works in different languages after the model's development the team did a lot of testing to make sure it wouldn't produce harmful content this included thorough safety checks red teaming where they tried to find weaknesses and automated testing these steps are very important as AI becomes a bigger part of everyday gadgets and handles more important tasks and 53 mini has been shown to produce harmful content less often than other models in conversations that have multiple turns this lower risk of the model saying something inappropriate or harmful is key for its use in the real world the creation of 53 Mini also focused on getting the community involved and supporting them by using a design similar to L and making sure it works with tools developers already use plus the model's design is flexible it includes features like long rope which lets the model handle much longer texts up to 128,000 characters using the 53 mini on your iPhone 14 really changes the game by making Advanced AI technology easy to access right on your phone and the best part is in my opinion that it ramps up our privacy we don't have to worry about sending our personal info to far off servers to use AI apps anymore everything happens right on our phones which keeps our data safe and private just the way it should be now although 53 mini has many benefits like all Technologies it has its limits one big issue is that it doesn't have as much capacity as larger models because of its smaller size for example it might struggle with tasks that need a lot of specific information like answering complex questions in a trivia game however this problem might be lessened by connecting the model to search engines that can pull up information when needed as shown in tests using the hugging face chat UI looking ahead Microsoft's development team is excited about improving the model's ability to work in multiple languages early tests with a similar small model called 53 small have been promising especially when it includes data from many languages this suggests that future versions of the feries could support more languages making the technology useful to people all over the world more by showing that a smaller data optimized model can perform as well as much bigger systems Microsoft is encouraging the industry to think differently about how AI models are made and used this could lead to new creative ways to use AI in areas where it was previously too demanding in terms of computing power Microsoft's 53 mini marks an important advancement in bringing powerful AI tools into our daily lives in a practical way as this technology keeps improving it is set to broaden what we we can do with our personal devices enhancing our experiences and abilities in new and exciting ways the ongoing development of such models will likely Inspire more Innovation throughout the tech industry potentially transforming how we interact with technology at a basic level and when you think about it the 53 mini isn't just a data optimization breakthrough it's actually a sign of where AI is headed it balances power and size with efficiency and accessibility setting the stage for smarter more adaptive and personal techn technology in our everyday lives all right don't forget to hit that subscribe button for more updates thanks for tuning in and we'll catch you in the next one"
