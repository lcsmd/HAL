        "description": "For my 1 Month Anniversary on YouTube, I deliver the hard truths of Home Assistant to help people interested in Smart Home technology determine if it's right for them.  Throughout, I use SmartThings, ActionTiles, SmartTools and Hubitat as benchmarks  of automation capabilities and expenditures of time.  If you subscribed to this channel, and you use Home Assistant, please laugh along with me and let me know if you relate.  I'd hate to lose any subscribers, so please do not take personally.  Home Assistant is by far the most powerful automation hub, but it comes at a significant expense of your time and labor.  If you have the brainpower I don't have, more power to you!\n\n✅Truths of Home Assistant from device compatibility, automation power and problems, and dashboards in addition to local capabilities \n✅A satirical guide to some of the HA hardships from RTSP cameras, Nabu Casa Cloud, Google Integration and Wi-Fi operation\n✅Required learning such as YAML, CSS, Python, Node Red, Z-Wave and Zigbee networks\n✅Security concerns / vulnerabilities of ecosystem including March 2023 Level 10 threat CVE-2023-27482\n✅Notable mentions of Hubitat C-8 and Home Assistant Yellow hubs\n✅A prelude to Samsung SmartThings local compatibility video and teaser to my ManicModMonday series\n\n*Like what you see?*  It only gets better from here! \n\n*Nothing* is safe from ManicMods! \n\nCome join me on an epic adventure to mod the world! 😁\n\n*Timestamps:*\n\n0:00   *Introduction*\n3:04    *Local Operation / Speed and Security*\n5:34    *Automation*\n8:07    *Dashboards *\n9:57    *Wrap-up*",
        "transcript": "foreign mods I'm kicking off my second month with a bit of a controversial topic so if you've joined me on this journey and you're a home assistant user please stick with me home assistant is an awesome product with an awesome Community this video is for people that are interested in Smart Homes and to help them determine if it's right for them this is the only video I'll do on the subject and I feel I owe an explanation and by six smart home features video David asked what about home assistant in my dashboard tutorial using action tiles another subscriber asked if I could create one for home assistant and this raised some serious questions look at these comments what do you say give me another spin oh no I have a family now you've matured you're focused refined dedicated I have a full-time job no free time I'm trying to grow this YouTube channel it will be good for the channel you'll be helping your community and peers no too many late nights as I brush off life I have everything I need life's about desires too treat yourself saw the things you can do you'd be Limitless I don't know I'll think about it so I I talked to homeless last night what did he want just catching up oh we go out for a bite to eat you know that's just slang for code that's not all we did whose home is that whose home is that an old friend of dad said he doesn't have time for anymore you know when you're told not to do something and it only makes you want to do it more the next day I open up my four-year-old VM like it was a box of drug paraphernalia yeah let it rip oh yeah nothing be right out the high was short-lived as I expected I had to rebuild my environment from the ground up I installed 2023.5 and within less than 24 hours I had all my devices in a crude dashboard and an entirely corrupted configuration file I bashed my head against the wall for four hours trying to restore the configuration woke up the next morning and remembered why I quit the hard stuff happened last night [Music] home automation is supposed to make life easier we automate things to provide us convenience and save time for us techies there's an Allure to complex automations and it can be a rewarding hobby but like any hobby it can become addictive while we lose sight of our goal this is why today I'll be delivering three hard truths around home assistant each of them will point back to our investment of time and for comparison's sake will be evaluated against smart things I often hear the two environments cannot be compared to each other and this is further from the truth every day oh to get this out of the way Wi-Fi devices are tremendously painful to integrate without the cloud Leviton is a partner of Home assistant and is one of the biggest electrical brands in the world still it requires editing the master configuration yaml file the easiest way to do this is the studio code server add-on The Beginner's Guide here can give you the fundamentals of yaml [Music] now rest assured you'll have a community to support you either way when speaking Z-Wave and zigbee protocols home assistant can control these out of the box but there are a few things you should know on this front however first nothing is out of the box with home assistant even the home assistant yellow a product by home assistant only supports zigbee natively to install your Z-Wave Network you follow a guide like this and to install a zigbee network you should follow this guide by the Home assistant community all goes well there are security concerns first it's not uncommon for devices to be added in securely and you have to re-add until it's operating in a secure mode second almost everything from device drivers to application code is Community Driven if you're a script Kitty like me you will go Bonkers trying to determine if the code is malicious these threats extend to the platform itself there was an authentication bypass vulnerability discovered in March of this year that had the potential to literally unlock your front door while many praise the quick fix the vulnerability had been lingering since 2017. quite interestingly many users report they were not at risk because they do not expose their instance to the internet which in my opinion is one of the best features of a smart home SmartThings is not a Walled Garden but it's a walk in the park compared to home assistant and it's a peace of mind knowing that the user base is 3 000 times larger and has a paid team dedicated to the security of the system it's also worth noting that I have over 170 devices in my house and 90 of them operate locally in SmartThings the same is true for automations and this number is only growing in the next few weeks I'll release a video detailing all the devices I use locally do me a favor and smash that like button if you want to see it one of the best features about SmartThings is you don't have to spend a half a day setting up a zigbee or Z-Wave Network new devices take moments to set up and operate without latency the speed is not a feature of Home assistant or SmartThings it's a feature of the protocol like any Smart Hub home assistance true power is harnessed when creating automations the biggest difference and problem with home assistant is that there is virtually no ceiling the sky is the limit you can only unlock sitting in front of your computer digging a hole when you succeed you further push the boundaries of what is possible losing track of your invested time that break even or your actual needs even if you want basic automation you have to configure them with your master configuration.yaml file before my brand new environment crumbled beneath me I was able to create more of my Automation in the GUI than previously possible still smarthomescene.com agrees that it can be a bit tedious setting up automations for simple things and recommends adding a scheduler plugin from the community store don't worry you'll still get to edit yaml files after the plugins installed you have a SmartThings or Hub attack equivalent GUI to automating your home remember you have to Tinker to Tinker for the good stuff if you go down this path I'd have to recommend this article the more advanced automations are only made made possible by creating an editing script in yaml files these scripts are often a nightmare to compile an incredibly exhausting to look at if an else logic blurs together in nested if statements and within the app they are even more unreadable node-red can give you a graphical relief using flow-based programming and you'll need it after getting through the self-declared simple tutorial simple did you catch that example at the end it was for automating lights to turn on and off with a door a big reason I left home assistant was that the automations were immensely cumbersome and not that reliable some of them were downright slow using my Raspberry Pi prior to upgrading to a dedicated VM this made my automations more reliable but too often an update came along and broke them anyway on the contrary SmartThings sets a reliable real-world ceiling in my house I can control and automate every light switch fan media device HVAC event and media device without scripting My Scene controllers and action tiles dashboards enable convenient control without summoning a voice assistant with that said I found Google and Alexa Integrations faster from SmartThings than traversing nabukasa from home assistant and the integration is free with almost 10 years using Voice assistance though I've come to prefer physical buttons dashboards or automations finally Samsung's rule engine has only gotten more sophisticated and is a hundred percent available from your mobile phone Samsung is looking to double its growth in the next few years and is heavily investing in bringing us even more automation capabilities [Music] my opening bit was supposed to be satirical but dashboards are one of the most alluring things about home assistant YouTube is loaded with great examples of these dashboards if you have a Roomba you can integrate it into home assistant to see where it's been if you have solar panels you can visualize power traversing between your panels and Electrical Company there are even Integrations for Ev cars that you can use as long as you don't get banned from the manufacturer's API there are a few considerations when these dashboards become appealing as a new content creator I look up to just about every other Creator before me these creators are as brilliant as they are helpful so I say this with zero disregard they make a living building and sharing these features home assistant requires a tremendous investment of time and money while you evolve your expectations as to what a smart home is as your expectations evolve so does the hole you inevitably slip into the default Lovelace dashboard is rigid columns are cumbersome and cards are a mess in no time at all your expectations drive you to plugins themes and writing CSS as user Patrick reports if you don't like yaml and you want this dashboard you're going to have to hire someone to do it for you and then keep them on a retainer for them to update it for you when something needs changing that's a five minute dashboard of action tiles and that's why it's so important you have to begin with the ending in mind if you don't have the hardware time need or skill sets to maintain mapping your Roomba or solar panel system while simultaneously monitoring your EV charging it's absolutely Overkill most of us are interested in centralized control and monitoring of our smart home including security cameras climate devices and batteries I recently uploaded a video showing how to build an action tiles dashboard in 30 minutes which includes all of these features for my own and other experiences it could take more than that to integrate a single rtsp camera into home assistant and these are the reasons I steer clear of Home assistant it's worth noting as a former habitat user many find it a great balance between the out of the box experience with Samsung and the automation capabilities of Home assistant it has an equally awesome and growing community and the holes are far less deep Hub attaches release their most powerful model yet the C8 like smart things its updates have been largely around localizing devices and improving their dashboard and Rule engines the purpose of this video is to have something to point back to when asked why I don't use this ecosystem and to warn you because it's easy to fall into the hole while many Savvy users say it's worth the time many of them likely have lost track of it years ago this is why I tried my best to share Reflections from other users in addition to my environment crumbling beneath me these users given a second chance may have taken a different route as the other Hobbs evolve and summer approaches there has never been a better time to consider time saving Alternatives reflecting your smart home needs if you're interested in learning more about my smart home check out my six smart home features video or guide I'm building my action tiles panel this is only my second month on YouTube and I'm committed to bringing you my more unique product modifications workarounds I just launched my manic mod Monday series and in episode 3 I will be bringing you the world's first smart napkin holder in the meantime it'd be cool to hear from you have you had similar experiences with home assistant or maybe you just think I'm an idiot let me know in comments below tell me anything but then to try home assistant again finally if you like the content like the content and if you want to see more of it you know what to do [Music]"
