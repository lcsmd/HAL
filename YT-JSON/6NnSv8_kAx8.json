        "transcript": "now in US Presidential politics former president Trump continues to bounce around from Courthouse to the campaign Trail this morning he was back to face trial for his statements about former columnist eege Carrol's sexual assault allegations in 2019 just ahead of the New Hampshire primary he got a boost from Florida Governor Ronda santz who decided to drop out of the race and back him conservative lawyer George Conway now joins Michelle Martin with incisive analysis on how Trump's legal woes are playing out and shaping this campaign thanks Christian George Conway thank you so much for talking with us thank you for having me so look I know you're a lawyer and a legal analyst you're not a political analyst per se but I did want to get your take on what we've just seen in Iowa as we are speaking now the Iowa caucuses are just behind us you know it's um by all accounts decisive victory for the former president there just what are your thoughts about that well I mean this is where we are I mean I I've been saying for quite some time that I thought that we're going to have the first for the first time running as a major Party candidate a convicted felon and that's what he I think he will be that by the time the fall rolls around because I do think the trial here in the District of Columbia the January 6th trial the one brought the case brought by Jack Smith just against him before judge shutkin here in the district I think that one's going to go to trial um you know it's just a remarkable Confluence of Firsts I mean we have the first adjudicated rapist who is going to win a major party nomination the first person who has been you know who who is under indictment in four separate jurisdictions with 91 counts I mean it is just absolutely unprecedented but with Donald Trump it's almost it's almost inevitable that this this was going to happen you have any thoughts about why these very serious allegations don't seem to make much difference in a in the political realm I mean you have you know close connections to people in the Republican political world I'm just interested in what you think about that it's partisanship run a muck in part and that I think a lot of this I and I do think there is some segment of the population that wants a strong man um and I I don't mean that in a complimentary way I mean that in the in the sense of a of a quazi dictatorial authoritarian figure uh they want to just basically assume the facts that they think are true are true they don't want to think they don't they're not interested in evidence but I think another thing that's going on here I think a lot of this is that people don't want to admit that they were wrong about Donald Trump don't want to admit that he's a bad person because if they admit that he's a bad person then they by extension are admitting that they are not good people for supporting him or at least it tarnishes them in their own eyes so they have to justify where they've been and and and where they're going um because they they just don't want to admit that he led them astray and and that they've been suckered and that that that that they're wrong and that that he's bad I I I think that's just a a big part of it is that true you think that's true for people in your own orbit oh well you know I mean my Orbit's changed a bit over the last few years but I think you know part of it is not wanting to admit your wrong but part of it also is um there's an identity there there's a there's a a a tribalism there and you know you don't you don't want to be excluded from the tribe because you don't you think the other tribe the the liberals who you've been hating on for so many years they're never going to accept you and if you if you dare question uh the leader um you'll be cast out of your own group and you'll be be homeless the other thing that I think is going on is there's an economy that has been built around Trump and Trump is um I think that there's a whole you have all of these consultants and all these politicians whose livelihoods or their chosen careers or their chosen course of of of their lives is dependent upon not uh antagonizing other people in that community and so I mean you see that with members of Congress who are who have to fear being primary you see that with political Consultants I mean for example uh the the it was reported just the other day that the Trump campaign is saying nobody should hire Jeff row who was a political advisor a chief political adviser for Ronda santis that they he's going to be blacklisted and nobody wants to be blacklisted nobody wants to be cast out of the tribe and there is just there's also Fe fear of physical intimidation and I think we saw that to to some extent uh with Lindsey Graham back in January of 2021 where he dared utter that he' been he was done with Trump or something like that and he was accosted at an airport by by by trumpers and you saw it also I mean one of the things that you've seen um when Liz Cheney was running for reelection in Wyoming she had to have a big security detail in Wyoming with never know and there is a there is certainly a degree of physical intimidation and um that you know frankly that's what January 6th was all about so let's pivot around to the the subject that sort of brought us together today which is you have actually said that you think that Trump will quote spend the rest of his life in jail you really think that I do think that I mean he's either gonna become president he's gonna spend the rest of his life in prison he certainly deserves to spend the life the rest of his life in prison I think that if you take any combination of the counts in these four indictments with which she's been charged you w take almost any conviction and almost any combination of them is going to uh put him in jail for a number of years and you know this is a this is a 77 year old man so I I I think there is a very good chance he'll spend the rest of his life in jail and and that's part of the dynamic that is going on here he knows that I mean he's not a strategic thinker he's a he's a sociopath he's a he's a he's a man with a reptilian I'm not going to say intellect but he understands that he is cornered and that's when people you know people like him with that kind of psychology are the most dangerous but he understands that and he understands that the only way for him to escape the trouble that he's in is to be elected president do you think that the purpose of this presidential campaign is to keep him out of jail I think that is one major purpose I think another major purpose is to he does you know he's motivated by the things that motivate narcissistic sociopaths which is power um praise uh and and a desire to to inflict revenge on people who have defied him and I I think that we've seen that in some of what what you know what he's his people are planning for 2025 should he be elected I mean they're going to they're going to seek retribution he says he's retribution on behalf of the American public or at least his slice of the American public but that's what motivates him I don't think you can understand what Donald Trump says and does on a daily basis simply by saying oh he's a bad guy he's a republican he's a authoritarian he's he's racist he's misogynist he's this or that you have to tie it into his fundamental psychological profile people should not shy away from that okay because I do not think you can understand his behavior without understanding his psychology and I think we're seeing that in the courtroom as as as it's happening today or this week in the egene Carol trial going to see it even more in the future so but let's talk about of of the of the he's got there are 91 felony accounts felony accounts across four cases what do you think is the strongest of those oh well I think the strongest one with the strongest case I think is which is a slam dunk case because it's so simple is the case in Florida the marago documents case uh you know there there's no there's really no factual dispute about what happened there because he was caught red-handed with the documents the documents to not belong to him they belonged to the United States of America they had classified document markings and it doesn't even matter that they were in fact quote unquote classifi because the charges that he has been uh that were filed against him which include charges under the ES Espionage Act and and those charges do not turn on specific whether they're specifically marked as classified they simply turn on whether or not it's National Defense information of any degree of significant sensitivity and you have that and the fact that there are witnesses and there's video and and all sorts of evidence that he tried to hide those and did hide those documents from the FBI and that he failed to produce them when he was served with the subpena by the department dep of justice and that he had his lawyers lie to the Department of Justice and that's those are simple simple easily provable acts of obstruction of justice and when that case goes to trial um I think I don't know that it's going to go to trial this year because it's hard to say what the judge there is doing in terms of scheduling but I don't he doesn't have a defense in that case just not not a shred of a defense the other case that has gotten a lot of attention and that you have written about most recently is the case connected to the former president's role in the January 6 mob attack on the Capitol and in that case one of the things that has gotten a lot of attention from legal analysts and legal Scholars is this very sweeping claim basically saying that he has total immunity for anything that he does or anything that he did while in the office of the presidency so you wrote about that and the headline of the piece was that Trump's lawyer walked into a trap what's the Trap he walked into would you just to lay that out for us well the Trap that they they walked into was that they were pushing arguments that were in ttention with each other or they were pushing for example they they were their principal argument is that there is an inherent immunity in the Constitution that comes with the presidence that means that you cannot be subject to essentially to any legal process they that that does not that those that line of cases has never been app applied to the president in in the criminal context it's been applied in the Civil context and the cases are based upon the notion that if you have you president does things that affect so many people that if you allow them all to sue if he did something that harmed them the president would be continually and Su them Su the president personally for damages you'd end up with a situation where the president would be worrying about everything he does and who is going to sue him for what and the president will be worried more about his personal finances and more about the cost of Defending litigation than he would be actually doing his job but again that rationale only applies to in the Civil context and it only extends uh by the by the terms of the case law the case the leading case being a case called Nixon against Fitzgerald which was decided in 1982 to the Outer Perimeter of the president's official responsibilities now that's a pretty broad standard it's basically as broad as you can make it reasonably but it's you know it doesn't apply to essentially conducting a coup but the other point is it's never been applied to the criminal context and that's the that's the thing that that that that that that I think he's going to absolutely lose on which is the notion that somehow you can extend this civil liability Doctrine to the criminal the criminal context now the Trap that he set for himself is what that he made a secondary argument an argument that is extremely weak based upon something called the impeachment judgment clause and what the impeachment judgment Clause of the Constitution which is an article one of the Constitution because it deals with congress's powers it's says that if you if some if an officer of the United States is removed from office by the impeachment process in other words impeached by the house and convicted by the Senate and removed as a result of the Senate conviction he can nonetheless be charged in the courts of law thereafter for any criminal conduct that the that was covered by the impeachment what what Trump has been arguing is that by by you could flip that over and say you can only be charged if you are convicted by the Senate and that's not what the Clause said but what what he did also at in in in what his lawyers did at this argument was at the same time that they were making this broad absolute criminal immunity argument they were saying and they were saying that we need that broad criminal immunity because um we have to fear political prosecutions when one Administration goes in and tries to prosecute the people in the last Administration the president of the last Administration he's saying we can't have that because we need to protect um um from political prosecutions but then they're saying at the same time the exception is if the president is convicted by the Senate you can nonetheless charge him which is inconsistent with the claim of ABS IM absolute immunity right because that's a political proceeding the impeachment is a political proceeding it's not a criminal proceeding Mr Conway you were actually in the courtroom can you just try to describe the argument ment and the exchange between one of Mr Trump's lawyers and judge Florence pan where you kind of laid out what you're describing as the the difficulties of that argument yeah I mean what she was doing was she was trying to pin him down and get con a concession from him that he was arguing for immunity so Broad and so absolute that a president of the United States could send SEAL Team Six up to the capital or wherever to assassinate political a political rival and be immune from prosecution for that criminal act and and she he he was refusing to give that concession cleanly he was saying yes but and the but was oh but a president could still certainly a president that did that would be impeached and removed and then he could be prosecuted because that's what the impeachment judgment Clause that I described earlier says the problem with that is that means the president isn't absolutely immune and that was sort of the gotcha that that that the Trap that uh judge pan was leading the lawyer into and the Le the lawyer realized he was being cornered and he kept trying to avoid avoid falling into the Trap by talking as fast as he could and and talking about things other than that weren't responsive to her answer and then there's also the tension involved between you know his position that the president shouldn't be prosecutable because we we fear political prosecutions while at the same time saying but a president can be prosecuted if the most Pol iCal body in the United States or in in the United States government which is the Congress of the United States says so and so basically when she got done with him his his position looked nonsensical it looked ridiculous and and that was only about 10 or 15 minutes into the argument and you knew which way the panel was going to come out at that point because he didn't get any help from any of the other judges you know you know what look he is like any defendant entitled to a vigorous defense right yes so and he is in a until proven guilty in a court of law like any defendant but I mean is one of sort of the axioms of the American experience that no one is above the law in the United States no one I mean it is sort of fundamental not just to American identity but to American law like that is who we say we are and I sort of Wonder is there any part of you that worries as an officer of the court that someone is making an argument that you know that someone this particular singular figure can never be prosecuted or held to account in court for anything that he does I just I just wondered if you thought about that well I I I do I mean I don't think it's an argument that you know should cause someone to lose their bar license but I do think it's an argument that is very very dangerous if it were ever taken too seriously and and here's here's why it's not just that we are a nation of of of of laws and not of individuals but it's the fact that this is part and parcel of what an authoritarian leader wants to have authoritarian leaders if you if you if you talk to students of of history and students of of of international political science and what they will tell you is that you know authoritarians are criminals and they one of the re one of the things that they seek is the ability to do whatever they please and make the Law whatever they want and make it the law make people of their choosing subject to the law while nonetheless not being subject to the law themselves this is not really that new for Trump I mean Trump is someone who said I think back in 2019 or 2018 article two of the Constitution the constit the part of the Constitution that deals with the president allows me to do what to do whatever I want he actually believes that but that's again that's that's because of that's he he believes that not because he's a legal scholar but that's his essential nature George Conway thank you for speaking with us [Music] [Music] I"
