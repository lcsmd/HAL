        "transcript": "are you getting started running Docker containers in your home lab are you wondering what are the best Docker containers to run on my Home Server well I've got you guys covered I'm going to consider with you guys the top five Docker containers to run on your home server and why I run them so stick around let's Dive Right In [Music] so guys the first Docker container found on my list of the best Docker containers for Home Server is a solution known as Rancher Rancher is a fantastic kubernetes management and orchestration platform that allows you to easily spin up new kubernetes clusters and even onboard and manage existing kubernetes clusters in your environment Rancher includes Integrations with the popular public Cloud providers as well as private Cloud Technologies such as VMware vsphere and since I run my home lab on VMware vsphere it makes it extremely easy to use Rancher to deploy new kubernetes clusters on top of vsphere using the cluster management functionality found in Rancher you can easily create new kubernetes clusters and as you can see you can create those on top of public Cloud Technologies such as eks AKs and gke as well as using emphasis structure is a service platform such as Amazon ec2 Azure virtual machines digitalocean as well as other providers such as lenode and as I already mentioned VMware vsphere using the rke configuration with node templates you can Define all of your node templates and then Rancher will then build out the kubernetes cluster based on those node template configurations by navigating to the apps catalog you have full access to all of the available Helm charts that allow you to easily spin out additional applications in your new kubernetes clusters managed by ranchers so you can easily spin up Solutions like gitlab hashicorp Vault MySQL and many many other applications as you can see in the full list of the catalog Rancher is arguably my top pick of the first Docker container that you spin up on your Home Server as it is is a gateway to many other solutions that you can then stand up using the Rancher solution and new kubernetes clusters that you have provisioned with Rancher the next Solution on my list of the best Docker containers that you can run in your home lab and on your home server is a solution called portaner portaner is an excellent management solution for Standalone Docker containers allowing you to easily install configure and manage containers running inside of kubernetes Docker host Nomad and the list goes on and on if you're looking for that graphical user interface that is the ultimate way to visualize and see all of your Docker containers running on your Docker host or tainer is it deep retainer dashboard is just quite simply beautiful you can easily visualize and see the Integrations with your Standalone Docker host or even if you have pertainer installed in a kubernetes cluster it makes it super easy to manage and visualize all of those container resources that you have running inside of your Docker environment I love the fact that you can easily see all of your containers you can see the image that they're running the creation date the network configuration publish ports all of that configuration is exposed very easily for you to manage and configure and then as you can see you can select containers you can perform life cycle operations starting stopping restarting you can add containers to the environment another thing that I really like about Cortana is the ability and integration that it has with Docker compose with the visual editor so in a visual GUI way you can navigate to Stacks you can manually edit in the web editor if you have Docker compose code that you want to paste in you can do that here you can upload files you can point it at a get Repository you for running gitlab or according to a repository that's publicly accessible and you can also customize templates so you can create those application Stacks very quickly and easily pertainer like Rancher also has a built-in registry of very common applications that ones may want to install inside of their Docker container host the list is quite a few applications however it's not as extensive as the list that you get with Rancher and of course you can still always pull publicly available containers these are just the ones that are built in out of the box for easy installation and provisioning so pertainer is an excellent option and certainly is on my list of the top Docker containers for the home lab the next container on my list of the best Docker containers to spin up on your home server in the home lab is a Docker container solution called gitlab if you're like me you have been working on your devops skills your platform engineering skills as they're calling it now understanding the whole get process is fundamental to understanding how to build these CI CD pipelines that devops Engineers as well as developers are taking advantage of today when using Solutions such as containers to build these micro services and other applications I am experimenting around in the home lab with cool projects that I really have been interested in such as automation with my home lab processes such as image bills and keeping up with my terraform and ansible code that I have been writing to do various things in the home lab and to do that I use gitlab heavily using gitlab you can create your own private git repository to actually check in code in your home lab environment and use that to trigger other tasks and automated processes so gitlab is a great way to do that and it's easy to spin up especially using portaner to pull down that gitlab Docker container so I have the docker container spun up for a gitlab and so we're going to log in and I'm just going to show you guys some of the cool things that we can do we can create projects and as you can see here I've created a new project my awesome home lab project and with this we can see all of the capabilities that we have to actually use this new repository that is attached to this project and as you can see as well you've got all of the tools and tool sets as you're used to or want to learn about if you're interested in this whole concept of devops platform engineering or keeping up with your home lab code you can use gitlab to effectively do that one of the cool things that I do with my production gitlab instance in the home lab environment is I actually use CI CD Pipelines in conjunction with hashicorp Packard to maintain and keep my image bills current for both Windows Server as well as Ubuntu Server so that I don't have to manually do those types of tasks in the home lab environment so you can do really cool things like that and that's been part of my learning experience over the past couple of years is getting my mind around some of the concepts and workflows of the devops workflow process running gitlab as a container is a great easy way to stand up a gitlab instance and start learning about this workflow of devops checking in your code checking out that code updating it using that to create CI CD pipelines and all of those things are just going to help you with your learning and taking that knowledge into production environments that you're working with number four on my list of the best Docker containers to run on your home server in the home lab is a solution call hashicor revolved as we've just mentioned we've covered starting to delve into devops and infrastructure as code checking in that code to a solution like gitlab or a code repository one of the things that you really start thinking about when you start delving into infrastructure is code is how do I deal with passwords and secrets I don't necessarily just want to be in plain text in my code that I've checked into the gitlab repository so you start to think about how you handle those things hashicor vault is a solution that allows you to either statically create credentials and store those safely and securely there or dynamically create credentials on the fly in your code and have those merged into your code on the fly as you have these build processes run I use hashicorp Vault to store credentials that I call in my Packer code for instance so that I can build virtual machines without having to hard code credentials for my vcenter server or for an esxi server but that's just scratching the surface you can house any type of credential that you want hashicorp vault is fairly easy to get installed and I actually use the built-in hashicorp Vault application via the helm chart built into Rancher so I went through the Rancher installation of hashicorp Vault and was able to successfully get vault configured and up and running and I actually have a fairly detailed blog post on how I went about doing that so I can just do a coupe CTL get pods and we're going to look at the namespace of Vault and as you can see I have a couple of PODS running that constitute the Vault installation so I'm going to go out to my Vault insulation we get the login page we log in with our token that we've created and as you can see I have just a simple Vault installation I've got my vcenter server Secrets engine however you can create any kind of secret engine that you want to utilize that basically covers most of the public cloud and private Cloud environments interacting with with your secrets and as you can see you can create generic key value pairs Vault can actually act as a pki infrastructure to hand out pki certificates in the environment SSH one-time password active directory AWS Azure Google Cloud a lot of strong integration with hashicorp solution so I can just create a new key value pair call this test KV and we're going to enable the engine and you can create new values for the newly created engine easily let's call this my app user and we can save that and we can add additional values so we're going to call this my app password and we can save that as you can see in our key Value store we have a test KV engine we've got a Maya password a my app user so we can programmatically hit our vault instance and this key value store and we can automatically pull those values from this key Value Store instead of hard coding my app password and my app user you can pull those from that key value pair very easily well finally on my list of the best Docker containers to spin up for your home server in your home lab environment is a solution known as Dashi and I covered this topic in detail about how to create the ultimate home lab dashboard so when you spin up all of these containers alongside your other virtual machines and other services that you have running in the home lab you need a way to keep up with those Services how do you get to them a home lab dashboard is a great way to do that Dashie is the solution that I have chosen in my home lab to run my homelab dashboard and I love how it allows me to keep up with those critical Services my home lab dashboard allows me to keep up and bookmark those services and resources that I want to quickly be able to navigate to so I have this configured as a new browser tab that each time I open my browser it actually opens my homelab dashboard I've got critical Network Services in the dashboard I have my hypervisors with esxi hosts proxmox hosts out of band management for those super micro servers that I have running in the lab I've got my UniFi equipment including my unified protect controller unify controller as well as kubernetes and containerize workload services such as my Rancher installation and fortainer just as a couple Dashie makes this easy to create you can configure and easily add Services creating new sections to your dashboard new entries to those dashboards and cooling customize really nice looking icons for those services that are easily obtained and readily available out on GitHub so guys what do you think these are my top five Docker containers to run on your home server in the home lab I am by no means saying these are the top Docker containers to run in your home lab really each home lab environment or production environment are snowflakes they're all different so the docker containers that may be most useful to you might be different containers than I'm running as my top five however hopefully this list of my top five Docker containers might give you guys some ideas of things that I'm using Docker containers for in my home lab environment so that it can inspire you to perhaps try some of these Solutions I'm Brandon Lee please do like the video subscribe to the channel keep on learning in your home lab environments and I hope to see you guys soon foreign [Music]"
