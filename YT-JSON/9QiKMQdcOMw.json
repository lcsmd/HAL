litigation council he employs a practical problem-solving approach when advising clients and finding solutions to their concerns robert you may begin thank you dave and thank you everyone for being here today and taking time out of your thursday afternoon uh hopefully you'll find this a program to be entertaining and certainly educational as we go into um i think a very relevant topic for associations in these days certainly i think covet has had an impact on this but i think it actually predates covert quite a bit um we obviously are going to be discussing harassment and what to do about it when you see it in your association so connor can you go to the next slide start off a little bit with some of the topics and kind of the flow of what we intend to discuss today harassment what does the word really mean because that word gets thrown out at the drop of a hat and maybe sometimes what's being called harassment may not really qualify as to what we as lawyers call or think of as harassment what is not harassment and that kind of flows with that what are the legal implications of actions when someone is claiming harassment if it actually does rise to that level what you can do what options board may have uh that's maybe available for actual harassment in the association um and what what about options the board has when the accusations or there's activity which maybe it doesn't rise level of harassment but it's something that the association needs to address or deal with so we're going to start off with a couple of polls so we know who's here with us today i'd like to get some information on that so if i'm going to start the first poll the question is what is your status and i don't mean that in terms of anything other than as a board member homeowner manager or professional service provider so if you can answer that that'd be great we'll give you a little bit of time for that 10 more seconds for that guy okay so for that poll we have about 64 of our attendees so 76 of them are board members we have 28 of our attendees that are homeowners we have seven that are active community managers and then we have eight professional service providers here as well great thanks thanks for that that's actually useful for us as we go so we can target some of our information a bit we have another question to kind of understand maybe what brought you to this webinar today why you're interested in this subject the first and the question is i've been the victim of harassment i or a board i am on have been accused of harassment i see activity in my community that concerns me as it could possibly rise to level of harassment all the above or none of the above just a few more seconds here okay so for that poll for number a we had about 17 people say they feel that they've been a victim of harassment we have nine that said that they are on a board and have been accused of harassment we had 49 people say i see activity in my community that concerns me as it could be harassment we had 20 put all of the above and we had 29 put none of the above interesting interesting well i think it's certainly a relevant topic i think we're seeing that in the results uh to that extent as well so let's start off with we're going to go through a couple of scenarios today uh to address what we deal with as lawyers and when what comes to us sometimes to uh to address on behalf of our clients let's start with scenario number one which is a border management that sends a violation letter to a homeowner that is engaging in nuisance activity and doesn't have to be nuisance could be any any violation of the governing documents really the owner receives the letter and responds to the association that not only are they not in violation but they feel they are being harassed by the association this is something that is a common response these days everyone seems to feel like they are being harassed or a victim of the association so it's very often that when we send letters out we get a response along these lines oftentimes they say they're being harassed based on their race they're being singled out because of that because they have children and maybe their children are playing on the street and that's what's causing an issue uh with possible nuisance in the association or they claim that they're being harassed and that they have special needs that the association has to accommodate or because some ongoing or previous problem and they're claiming that the association is retaliating against them and harassing them as a result in fact dan and i were talking about an issue along that line just this morning uh that very same issue so the question is what happens when you get a response from a homeowner how do you respond to that and why does it matter i want to be very clear this is not a uh webinar dealing with fair housing or it's not a fair housing uh webinar but it is related to fair housing harassment does fall within that so dan why don't you kind of take the first steps at um addressing this issue when you when the association gets a response claiming that they are being harassed when they receive some kind of a notice of violation sure of course and i and i think before we switch the slide one thing to focus on is that many of those categories that robert just mentioned you know race familiar status special needs or disability tie into this next area if you switch to the next slide one thing that we want to make clear as we briefly touch on fair housing is that there is indeed a difference and an important difference between uh the concepts of harassment and discrimination because in certain circumstances even though it might be some type of harassing activity whether or not the board takes action or is required to take action under fair housing regulations requires that it also be a form of harassment that is discrimination based on a protective class so if you switch to the next slide what's the difference well when fair housing comes into play when it is discriminatory housing practices that impact a protected class so there are a couple of key points in here that this can be a complaint from anybody the board or the association has to jump in if it's not only a complaint from an owner but tenants residents that live within an order of property uh employees of the association independent contractors your your landscaping uh or maintenance individual if if he alleges that he's been discriminated against because of his race then that is something the board has to look into uh it's conduct by the board by the association or again conduct by anybody at the property your management your vendors it's issues that the association not only actually knows about uh but should have known about through through investigation but i think the key difference between what is harassment and what is discrimination that triggers fair housing is this last step right here which is the existence of a protected class and that ties in specific key areas race sex age there's a full list of these but it has to be certain uh circumstances or categories of recognized protected individuals um so what does this mean there's if it's not a protected class then you you take one step versus if it is then then it triggers the fair housing uh issues robert do you have anything to add on that no i think we can actually go to the next slide and i'll i'll talk about kind of follow up on what dan was just discussing the fair housing regulations are designed to make sure that there's equal access to housing which is uh not denied to anybody on their basis of their falling in to a protected class as dan said again we're not going to be going to the fair housing we've done whole presentations just on this issue but it is important to know what what qualifies as a protected class and there are two places where we look for that one are the federal regulations and under the federal regulations the protected classes are race color religion national origin sex familiar status and disability and then under the california regulations because california is california we add to those sexual orientation orientation age gender identity and gender expression genetic information marital status medical condition ancestry and source of income so you can see by how broad those definitions are that really depending on what the activity is being complained of almost anybody falls within a protective class so you need to understand what those are what the actual activity is and we're getting into a little bit more into maybe some of the board's requirements to investigate those issues in a minute but why do we why do we care about this because generally associations you know we don't deal with neighbor-to-neighbor issues or try to avoid those but the fair housing regulations make it very clear that an association is a is a housing provider and may be directly liable for failing to take prompt action to correct and end the discriminatory housing practice even if it has nothing to do with the association if it's just an independent third party within the community so conor you can go to the next slide next slide the issue is is equal access being denied when a person is harassed because of the membership in a protected class this is the same thing of the california regulations and even california indicates that associations must investigate complaints of harassment and take appropriate action when it involves residents employees or even vendors and it's important that one of that definition is important because we oftentimes will have tenants or who are leasing properties and associations who complain uh that they're being harassed and the board will say well they're they're just a tenant they're not an owner why do we have to deal with tenants we typically don't engage with tenants but under the fair housing regulations it doesn't matter a resident can make a complaint to fair housing so it's very important to understand that that issue as well we're going to talk talk a little bit further later on about what happens when it doesn't fall within fair housing but for now let's move on to another scenario if you can go to the next slide dan i think this one's yours yep so we just briefly talked about individuals who are reporting it being very broad but it's also individuals who are engaging in a type of activity that is also very broad so scenario two comes up we have an owner who reports that one of the vendors a gardener uh is you know sexually harassing him or her and then when they try to complain the board members take take part in some type of activity and and now they're being accused of retaliation this specific scenario comes out of a case with the dfeh which is the department of fair employment and housing that is the government body that oversees the the fair housing complaints down in san diego so we had an individual that reported to the association through management that one of the gardeners had sexually harassed her made some some comments and and so forth and after she had reported uh the board didn't investigate the board didn't react the way that she wanted the allegations and and of course it was we don't know the specific facts that go into it but the allegations was that one board member in in response to her complaint uh spread lies to other members throughout the the housing throughout the association and refused to address her concerns uh and then yelled at her at a board meeting when she tried to bring it up and see whether whether anything was being done or what was happening the allegations then said that a second board member uh filed fraudulent reports against her uh professional licensing so that she lost her license as a result so as it's as it's been investigation by the the department of uh fair employment and housing uh regardless of of what was true and what was not it ended up settling and the resulting settlement including included that the association paid 120 000 dollars in damages and attorneys fees they had to update their anti-discrimination policies they had to post fair housing notices throughout the property they had to complete each of the board members had to complete fair housing training in order to make sure that this was not done again and then for a period of five years they had to check in and report any potential discrimination or harassment complaint back to the dfeh so that they could monitor for a period of five years essentially they were put on probation for five years and you know all of this is uh in the context of the settlement uh which had they not settled would then likely have gone into actual legal action against the association um just because they didn't take the the the steps to investigate as they should have so so what are the different types of or i guess when do we know whether uh there is sexual harassment that needs to be investigated well under the law the definition is that if there's any type of conduct that may create a hostile environment now i think most of us have probably gone through uh employment harassment training or some sort and that's exactly what we're looking like here they're looking into here in instances where that type of pervasive conduct that creates that hostile environment is present the definition is unwelcome conduct that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to interview it to interfere with the use or enjoyment of the dwelling so it's a very ambiguous definition that requires that investigation to make sure that you don't end up in the type of uh investigation by dfbh that this association did down in san diego perfect so uh carving the next slide so the question is what do you do when you receive complaints from voters or or vendors because it can be any third party of harassment which could violate fair housing regulations or which could impose liability in the association or the board that's that's a very the very the first thing you need to be aware of is is this something where we need to be concerned about uh and how do we address it and i see a question already i'm gonna answer go ahead and answer it right now which is there a distinction in terms of the board's obligation regard whether depending on whether it is a condo community or a single-family residence or a pud and the answer is no it does not matter it does not matter whether it is a condo or single-family residence community the obligations to investigate and address it are the same if you're a community association so the first thing to do in conor got it next slide is i'm going to say the first thing to do is work with council on these issues there's potential liability and i'm going to tell you the second thing to do again is work with council it is these claims can be tricky um there is potential liability i mean dan went over a simple example of one where i think the natural inclination of a board is hey this has nothing to do with us let's why do we need to get involved and yet you saw the potential uh risk liability and damages that that really flowed to that association as a result of not addressing the problem uh so if you don't know where to go the first thing to do when you get one of these complaints is get counsel involved have them work with you to find out what are the factors at play what is the complaint and walk you through the investigation in terms of the conduct that's being complained of the nature the scope the frequency uh the duration location those are all factors that go into hey does this rise to the level of harassment and frequency is an interesting one because a single the fair housing has said a single instance can rise to level harassment even only happens once uh if it's severe enough that could constitute harassment um and it does not matter whether the person who uh is complaining or was the victim or subject of harassment uh was actually damaged or harmed in any way it's just the fact that the activity occurred is sufficient to trigger some potential liability so that's the the implication is you need to work with counsel to work on work through these issues uh or you run or you run risk of what dan why don't you go through a little bit more some of the risks of failure to investigate and work through the issue let me let me address let me address one thing first let me address one thing first sure if something does not rise or fall within a protected class you may still have harassment but it does not mean you have to deal with it under under the fair housing uh rubric in terms of this investigation and i'll give you an example that actually this is a real life story right uh two neighbors one neighbor every day gets out there and throws the dog feces over the fence the neighbor who's receiving that believes he's being harassed but there's no claim that the harassment is occurring or in any way related to a protected class it's just one neighbor doing this to his other neighbor that may still be harassment and we'll talk about that but it doesn't necessarily mean you have to deal with it on the as a fair housing complaint or allegation so again there are times when you may have allegations of harassment but the association may not necessarily have to be involved or may be able to step away and say this does not deal fall within the rubric of fair housing and we don't necessarily have to have to get involved so um dan how should the investigation go i was going to tack on to a little bit of what you just mentioned is we have a case that's going on right now that initially was non-fair housing harassment because it was just neighbors you know yelling at each other staring staring into windows or or doing what they did but then as soon as there is a claim that oh no he's doing this because of my race or because in this case sexual orientation and that trigger word comes into play then it becomes a fair housing issue that the board has to jump in and deal with differently and and we would recommend one and two using counsel to do this now why is that the case because it then comes outside the scope and conor if you want to go to the next slide it comes outside the scope of uh just merely something dealing with the governing documents and then comes into a potential fair housing issue where the dfeh is involved like we talked about before and if the board doesn't jump in when this protected class becomes involved then they can go and file a complaint to hud it's referred to the ca dfeh for investigation there is a complaint filed to the association that requires a deadline i believe 30 days for response with evidence there's negotiation there's it becomes incredibly costly whereas if on the front line the board takes the steps to investigate they might find you know what these allegations aren't really sufficient because they're not frequent or they're not severe or they just don't pan out with evidence but at least you've taken the steps so that you don't end up in a situation where you then have uh the allegations of oh i did nothing or even worse oh you then retaliated against me when you tried to enforce against me and then you get the 120 000 damages in addition to the attorney's fees that you already spent so very important that as soon as we get into a situation where it might be fair housing that you take that investigative steps right so let's go ahead and go to the next slide so the question is what do you do you've done the investigation and you determined that there is some validity uh to the action to the allegation that it's actually happening it rises to the level where it's severe enough or frequent enough um that it's based on on a an allegation that's really to protect the class so now what are you supposed to do right and what fair housing says is you have to take some action what you can do or supposed to do is is directly related to the extent of authority you have over the matter so that could be sending a cease and desist letter possibly loving a fine and where this comes into play is oftentimes these allegations that are being alleged really fall within the question of it's not a a you know business use or failure to pay assessments what it may be is it may be creating a nuisance that's where potentially the board has some authority to take some action and maybe interfering with the homeowner's right or the resident's right to enjoy their their property they find enjoyment of their property so if that's the case now potentially the board has something where it says okay this activity is a is harassing to the point where it is creating a nuisance and now we can levy a fine we can actually deal with a violation of the governing documents uh we could potentially uh suspend membership privileges or even take legal action if necessary in order to enforce the ccnr's to abate the nuisance or stop the activity that is occurring again the extent of action the association has to take is directly tied to the board's authority and abilities under the governing documents in the law so you have to look for some tie-in between the activity that's being alleged and the board's authority to take some action under the government documents all right next slide dan what now we've said that her harassment goes beyond fair housing what if it's not a fair housing complaint before we jump to that there was a question that whether or not board members can investigate or in this case an executive committee can investigate all of those different natures the conduct frequency or if you have to call somebody like us and have council do that you want to take that sure well generally speaking okay there's not a requirement that council does the investigation i will tell you there are times when we where if the board is involved and i see something uh there were what if the allegation the board president is is in one way or another involved in the activity or either the victim or the the uh accused in those cases what we would recommend doing is the board create an executive committee so that the person who's involved in the activity is uh removed from the investigation and the decision-making process the executive committee then work with council or uh if they want to do it themselves they need to make sure that they're very comfortable with understanding what the investigation requirements are and what the standard is in order to determine whether you are dealing with a fair housing issue so you don't have to have counsel involved we will generally like to be involved to help because it is a complicated process but oftentimes boards will work through this process themselves with council's guidance um all right was there another question dan no i think that was the one so assuming it's not fair housing are we all done no because there's a difference between whether or not it's discrimination that triggers fair housing but there's still separate non-fair housing harassment that may occur and it's defined differently based on where you're at the the federal definition is a course of conduct directed at a specific person so it can't just be generally out there that causes substantial emotional distress in such person serves no legitimate purpose california as in most cases is a lot more specific as to what harassment is defined as and the best definition to to go off of actually comes in the context of a restraining order statutes which is 527.6 and and so forth but it defines harassment as uh an unlawful violence a credible threat of violence or a knowing and willful course of conduct directed a specific person you know that seriously alarms annoys or harasses a person serves no legitimate purpose now we bolded those those areas because they're different categories that are further defined in the statute for example unlawful violence is then defined as being assault battery stocking so very specific credible threat of the violence violence is further defined as a knowing and willful statement or a course of conduct that places a reasonable person in fear for his or her safety or the safety of his family um so actually putting forth potential threats that will cause a reasonable person to be scared now these these two deal with violence and they're handled under different potential types of restraining orders which we'll get into but there was a question uh looks like vicki asked if a neighbor's obnoxious and vulgar behavior is causing psychological harm to another neighbor is that considered harassment well maybe and it's this last definition annoying and willful course of conduct so looking at course of conduct it's it's a pattern of conduct composed of a series of acts over a period of time so just obnoxious and bolder behavior on on a on a one-time basis no it's not going to be considered harassment on a daily basis where somebody comes in and has this type of of very vulgar behavior and obnoxious is is another term that we we would need to go into but uh excessively vulgar or or uh uh this this type of um well if you go down below of course of conduct is something that causes a reasonable person to suffer emotional distress so if it's that type of behavior on on a on a more patterned basis then yes it would qualify as as something that would be considered harassment and actionable uh under this uh definition and that's a that's an important distinction there between between the fair housing statute and harassment in a more general context right under the fair housing regulations harassment can occur just by a single event a single event can rise the level if it is severe enough to be harassment versus here we need a core a pattern of conduct a course of conduct and that's probably going to require a series of events more than once more than just a single one-time event yeah and this goes into it just a little bit more um like robert said series of events continued continuity of purpose oh so it's in general something that there's a certain type of reason or you can see a theme uh of the actions um but it includes you know following an individual stalking an individual we had a homeowner follow one of the managers as they were outside uh doing landscaping inspections uh they went on a daily basis and and this person followed them down the street to the car well yeah that would cause a reasonable person to to become agitated or fearful and it it in addition to other activity that was being done at this time was a continuity of purpose that was [Music] reasonably um put in as harassment um multiple telephone calls to a board member or a management threatening them with with doing this or that uh sending harassing correspondence you know constant emails if it's something that over a series of time begins to add up then we start looking at whether or not this is indeed actionable conduct that might uh be considered harassment what what doesn't okay constitutionally protected activity and we'll get into that a little bit more but uh filing a formal complaint with management about certain activities or certain violations that's protected that's something that they have a right to do so it would not ever be considered uh harassment in this context so let's uh there's a there's a question i'm gonna go ahead and answer one is is a homeowner undergoing mental health treatment considered a member of the protected class for his or her mental disability well in california medical condition is one of the protected classes so that would likely fall within the fair housing regulations or at least that person would be fall within the category of protective classes there's another question what if a board member is harassing a member well that that kind of falls in line with that first scenario we gave right where it involves the board following up with something but then it is the board still has to investigate it assuming it is a if it's a fair housing issue you have to follow the fair housing guidelines create an executive committee to remove that director from the investigation and disciplinary process i would probably create an executive committee regardless to determine if it's a rising to the level of whether it's a nuisance and whether the board is going to get involved in dealing with some type of enforcement action under the governing documents and there's a question also that kind of related to that is at what point does harassment between do homeowners become a police matter not something the board deals with well the first question is if it's related to a uh protect the harassment related to protective class you're you've got to deal with it you you may tell the people hey you know what call the police uh but the board still has to investigate it and deal with the fair housing issues if it is not related to harassment related to protect the class then the board should look at it the way i always advise my clients is don't say it's neighbor to neighbor and just be done with it say do we have something here that's a violation of the governing documents or not if it's a violation of the governing documents maybe it could be a nuisance maybe it doesn't and then you go through the normal process of do we want to start the enforcement process do we want to find them you know you do have to do something to enforce your governing documents but the law recognizes that in the absence of some other reason like a fair housing obligation litigation is expensive and time consuming and uncertain and the board doesn't necessarily have to file a lawsuit you can say at that point we don't have a fair housing issue here the board is going to make a business judgment decision not to pursue this any further and say to the homeowners you each have the ability to enforce occurring documents yourselves but the board is going to take a step back and not take any additional action and yes it can apply to a homeowner harassing a board member as well again we're looking at um whether it is now we're going to go a little bit further into that as to whether it's actually harassment but if it's related to a protected class it does not matter whether it is who's who's the accuser or the accused you still conduct the same uh analysis uh next slide before you move on really quick there was a question there about whether or not it's flipped and something against the board member and that may trigger additional qualifications because of the way the board member is and we'll get into that a little bit more but in terms of the the breadth of what is considered harassing activity it certainly applies both ways correct correct so let's let's go on to the next slide with some of them we're going to cover i think some of that in the upcoming slides so uh let's look at another scenario again which is uh this never happens right this is totally fictional an owner starts sending a significant number of emails some daily or multiple times a day to the board or management complaining about an issue stating that the board is ineffectual or engaging in mismanagement makes demands for records communications with vendors or council and amen and it's requesting the member list is that in and of itself harassment well we're going to talk a little bit about the public forum and the free speech rights that are in uh involved in a homeowners association uh but generally speaking when you look at this are they entitled to some of these to make some of these records depending on the records that they're asking for they may be entitled to those and that doesn't necessarily mean that that's uh harassment if they're exercising their member rights if they're doing it multiple times a day uh that might start now to create that course of conduct and pattern which may be that we have to take some action to address whether it's legal action or just trying to temper the communication or how you're going to deal with that what if in their emails they use vulgar language or threaten to sue the board does that change things well we're not dealing with fair housing anymore now we're out of that so we're looking at that course of conduct threat of violence standard that dan mentioned earlier so again you're going to do that analysis from earlier now what if they threaten physical violence or destruction of property if the board attempts to enforce coming documents or does not address the issue in the way that they would like and this is obviously has happened sadly several times where we've had to get the police involved the best story i have is where we called the police for somebody who's being called a hearing that night and he said he was going to shoot the next person who towed his car and the police department was kind enough to show a better meeting searched him and frisked him before he entered into the room and stood right outside the door the entire hearing so they obviously took it serious enough to do something in that case um but now again we're getting closer to that uh standard by which it could be harassment um and what action there may be civil liability attache that attaches to that let's i want to get another poll question now in terms of how many of you out there have had to deal with these types of issues right has any as your board or management than the target of an owner or understanding vulgar or threatening emails i'd love to know and more seconds on the pulling here okay robert we had of 71 people said sadly yes and we had 55 people say luckily now i will tell the 51 people you are lucky you are lucky it is happening more and more and i think the 71 i think it was you said uh that said sadly yes we'll tell you it is a very frequent occurrence um right now i mean i'm getting calls or questions about this on an almost daily basis um to some extent one extent or another um and you know when we do the way we deal with homeowners that are that are we you know sending in multiple emails a day repeatedly making the same requests i will advise you i would say look get counsel involved sometimes you can make counsel the point of contact for that person so that they know they have to go through us we make them uh every communication has to be done in writing we respond to them in writing so we can start documenting the activity and if and and address them we make sure that if they have requested records those records are produced within the statutorily mandated time frame but we start dealing with them and on a legal basis sometimes it upsets them in the beginning but when they start to see that they are that they're you know pounding the table is not going to change anything sometimes they will start to get tired um and that's that sometimes can be a very effective way to deal with these owners uh and try to hear them out in that way uh let's do another uh another scenario or another poll question um because this is the other hot topic right which is has your board been the target of statements on social media i'm gonna i'm gonna expand this because i saw some notes in the uh in the question and answer session section it not just social media like facebook or twitter or next door but what about having uh letters or or notes left on people's doors or in mailboxes about 15 seconds left on this pole okay okay robert for that poll we had 57 people say yes 23 people said no and then we had 43 people said they didn't know or weren't sure uh well that this is kind of the next big thing is what we're seeing is the the issue of homeowners who start a facebook page or go on next door and you know as often happens the people who participate in these are the people who are upset right people who don't have an issue tend not to get involved on social media they're just go along they don't even realize that there's an issue the it is it is that being upset over whatever issue is that is a motivator to get people to try to spruce into action and to either write reviews on yelp or to get involved on next door or to start a facebook group um so the question is what can you do about harassment on social media um let's go to the next slide honor so go to the next one we already did that very dumb so what can you do when you when you there is social media or some activities such as letters that are being left on doorsteps uh whether it's facebook next door letters it's all the issues really related to the same is can you stop that harassment well the first question you have to ask and this is the important question in this context is does the speech relate to a matter of a public interest the courts have determined that what happens within the community association is a matter of public interest to that community you know we oftentimes say that association board meetings are not open to the public they're not they're only open to members they're not public meetings and which is true because they are only open to members the requirement is only that members be allowed to attend but when it comes to what is going on in the community the courts have determined that the homeowners and the residents and that i guess the homeowners in that community have a right to know what is occurring and to be able to engage in discussion uh freely so whether it's on next door or being left on your doorstep now let's put aside the issues of potential trespass or something like that i don't want to get into that here but the idea of the homeowners expressing their their sentiments about what is occurring is deemed to be a matter of public interest to the people in that community so if it is relates to matters that the homeowners in the community may want may want to know about or have a right to know about you have to be very careful we're going to talk a little bit more about some of that going forward and the question is then is it actually harassment and again dan defined harassment very early on right that course of our conduct of a course of conduct that rises to the level which is going to create an annoyance or harassment for somebody and or you can add in the threat of violence as well or is it just an annoyance is it just somebody saying i disagree with you or you know a little more forcefully um and then the other question is sometimes what we get is hey they're accusing the board of uh a theft of stealing money from the association and that's embezzlement or that is that defamation so let's move forward to the next to the next slide now so when we're talking about defamation dan what is defamation what do we really think what is that definition well it's very specific and i think everybody is aware of the the adage that if it's true it's not defamation which is is the case if you're able to prove that that the matter is uh is true then it doesn't fall again into the first category here which it needs to be a false statement but more than that it needs to be a false statement that is implied to be a matter of fact and so what does that mean it means that uh i can spout off my opinions as to certain things but unless i'm stating hey this is a fact um i opinions don't count as defamatory conduct what else has to be involved well there has to be publication and that doesn't just mean it has to be written down and disseminated publication just means that a third party needs to be made aware of it whether it be in speech or we have here written here libel which is the written form that counts as as publication it needs to be intentionally sent to another person or said to another person now there is a little subset of libel that's libel per se there are certain things that when printed or written or sent about a certain person certain types of statements they're considered uh liable per se in the sense that they're automatically considered defamatory you don't have to prove them up and what types of those well the best example of that is is if you claim that somebody has committed a crime right and in in these circumstances you don't have to prove that it specifically injured a person because it's automatically assumed under statute that if i say that robert committed this felony and i published that out that it will discredit him in a way that is considered defamatory it's automatically considered that i don't have to prove up that part of that so anything that is related to crime or misconduct uh innuendo is a little bit harder to say that they have a a certain type of shifty character a little bit difficult because there's gray lines there um but but that uh automatically means you don't have to prove up the second or the last part is that it causes specific damage to this person now what isn't defamatory well privileged communications uh we'll get into an example a little bit later on but there's case law that says that the litigation disclosures that your attorneys send out uh as to ongoing litigation uh are not defamatory statements because we're apprising the membership of of what's going on with this litigation what it's about uh and regardless of what the outcome is going to be if i'm saying that well it's these parties and it's about this type of situation and allegations that's not considered defamatory because the association has a right to send out those type of communications there are other ones we'll get into but those those are the primary elements of defamatory statements and it causes damage well yeah and and it causes specific damage to the individual and by that we mean uh an impact on their reputation they lost business uh and stuff like that so all right so we now we have an understanding of what defamation is and or reliable the question is can you stop some of these statements from being expressed uh whether it's in social media or at a board meeting during home in a forum um you know sometimes you'll have somebody come into our home or forum and make those same statements that they're making on social media so we've already talked about the fact that what happens within an association is a matter of public interest uh the the next piece of this is some a board member gets accused of of um stealing money from the association right now you've got a matter of public interest because it relates to uh stealing money from the association and the association's funds and balance and you have a direct a statement that could be defamatory dan said committing a crime is liable per se so now can you stop that well the question is or the problem is that just like we have a public forum or a public public public interest in the association some of you may may have heard of the it's a famous case for lawyers the new york times or sullivan case where the supreme court decided that a celebrity a matter a public a public figure has a higher burden to prove defamation than the average person because they inject themselves out into the public so they now have a burden to prove some additional additional steps if they're going to prove defamation well courts have ruled that a director uh has by their the essence of their volunteering and being involved in the association again injected themselves into the community on a limited range of issues relating to the association and they are deemed to be a limited uh limited purpose public figure um similar to a celebrity generally so with matters leading to the association now you have a public figure and that increases the burden that they have to prove defamation you not only have to prove that the statement was false but you also have to prove actual malice that the statement was made with the actual intent to harm that is very very difficult standard to prove so sometimes we get asked you know can we do something about that and we're going to talk about whether the association of the director can but it's certainly if it relates to you and you're feeling like well this is defamatory against me i understand that as a director you have an additional burden to establish defamation it's not enough that they say you're stealing when you're not it has to be done with actual malice and uh dan how are those how are those uh standards actually proven by what standard of evidence can you go to the next slide connor there's a different standard for both you know robert said that malice is very difficult to prove it's exceptionally difficult to prove and here's why falsity whether it be limited purpose public figures or in general defamation is under what's known as the proponents of evidence standard anytime you see somebody going to trial and going before a jury most of the time it's a 50 50 decision which side is more likely well that's what falsity is you just is it more likely by this evidence that uh the statement is false well malice is a little bit different it's it falls under the clear and convincing evidence standard which means there has to be not just 50 50 but overwhelming evidence uh almost to the level of what we hear in in a criminal context beyond a reasonable doubt not quite that far but definitely more than 50 50 chance overwhelming evidence clear convincing evidence that it was done with uh malicious intent that it was annoyingly false statement or that there is uh if you look down below uh it's fabricated it's completely made up or there's absolutely no attempt at verification whatsoever right so i get an anonymous source i completely act on it you but it has to be proved up with that uh overwhelming evidence um more than the 50 50 standard there so it's very difficult when you fall into this limited purpose public figure to be able to assert that definite defamation claim because of the way that the law is trying to protect the ability to have that type of discussion next line so what can you do when those statements are being made as as an association uh can you take action to address some of these issues well the courts have held that the association only as the association itself and i want to separate out the association from individual directors the association only has a right to to pursue the matter if the defamatory statements can be interpreted as relating to the way the director performs his or her duties and responsibilities so as to have a natural tendency to affect the corporation disadvantagedly in its business so basically if what is being said is impacting the association's ability to conduct this business the association may have a right of action what would be an example of that uh i mentioned earlier the you know an example of a director being accused of uh of stealing money from the association does that necessarily impact the association in the way it conducts this business probably not but let's say now the statement is the association is not paying its vendors right it is not going to pay its vendors it just decides that it it's just not going to pay anybody at all it doesn't pay any vendors so that what happens that gets out in the community and the vendors either cancel their contracts refuse to perform services and it's not true right they're paying all their vendors but they hear about this negative they become afraid of the concern that they not are not going to get paid and new vendors will not bid on projects for the association because of their concern over getting paid now potentially the association may have a right of action because that now has interfered with its ability to retain and hire new vendors if it does not impact the association the association may not have a right of action the director may still have a right of action independently of the association and the question is you have to look at do you have your own right of action meaning can you file your own lawsuit and if you're going to do that be aware that you're a limited public figure the discussion that's being held is designed to be protected and if it relates to the association's business or business of the association it's probably going to be held to be protected from and allowed in order to protect the matter of public interest and there's a difference between an accusation that a homo a director is take stealing money from the association clearly related to association business if the accusation is that the director committed a crime independent of the association was drunk driving for example again let's say that was false that is not necessarily related to the association that standard of being a public figure likely would not apply in that circumstance unless they were able to successfully tie that into the association business which will be much more difficult um all right next slide so dan lost the slap bet so he's going to cover the anti-slap motion so because of those risks dan what of the communications being either related to a matter of public interest or the directors have been identified as limited purpose public figures what protections are in place to protect speech and why is that a challenge for associations so the legislators adopted a specific way for people to make sure that certain lawsuits aren't aren't filed that are attempting to we use the phrase chill speech but it's not just free speech it also involves engaging in in the litigation and engaging in the judicial process um for example filing lawsuits you can't just automatically sue somebody back just because they filed against you that's protected there has to be another basis for that but in this context of harassment it will focus on the free speech areas so because somebody has exercised their ability to engage in the protective activity of free speech to for example criticize the board member during open forum or to actively campaign against certain individuals during the election process they can't be sued for that and in order to make sure that uh that the courts one aren't uh embroiled in this type of litigation but two that people don't have to expend enormous amounts of money in defending themselves just for engaging in these types of protected activities the legislation has has put together a special motion to strike so what does that mean so if i get if the association gets sued for you know we use the example earlier of sending out uh the litigation disclosures uh if if we get a cross complaint back just based solely on the fact that uh the association is sending out updates on litigation to its members then what we would do is file this special motion to strike which says this lawsuit is improper it's trying to basically shut the association up uh and and it needs to be uh dismissed now what what is added on to that is that usually these also have the ability to uh recover attorney's fees so there's a there's an extra incentive uh into not filing these we have the note there at the bottom that the deadline is generally 60 days after service of the offending complaint which is usually a cross complaint as we see it why is that important well because the deadline for responding to a complaint is only 30 days so we have an additional period after this in order to evaluate to make sure that it's not uh impacting free speech and and to be able to respond accordingly so why is this important in the harassment context well because it means that as a board when individuals are complaining about specific areas that are protected we can't automatically go after them and just and try to shut them up uh they have the rights to be able to engage in this activity and not only that they have a statutory ability to make sure that that right is is prevails now let's switch the next um so we talked a little bit about uh about when it comes into play but here's the showing for what goes into that type of motion what do we have to prove if we're bringing this motion or if anybody is is bringing this motion up uh the lawsuit arises from protected activities and seeks to either silence free speech and misconduct our context or like i said earlier or prevent the party from seeking a right of petition basically anything involving the court system this includes any written oral statement made in the public forum open forum at a board meeting a publicized newspaper that the association puts out that kind of situation in connection with an issue of public interest now that part of it is very broadly broadly construed so anything in this context dealing with as we'll see later with the membership uh just be if it touches on association issues generally the courts will define this as an area of public interest because most of our associations are have quite a number of people involved and concerned and so it's a public interest so it's very in this context very broadly construed a statement made by or on behalf of the governing body of the association constitutes a public forum so if you get that first part of it which in this context is is very is generally very easy to show then the burden shifts to the other uh individual the person making the claim to demonstrate the merits by establishing sufficient evidence exists to show the likelihood of success in a sense there in order to beat the motion and allow the slap to go through they have to show that they're probably going to win now in the context of this situation we talked about before it's very difficult to show the defamatory statement or the defamation claim so in that case it's very difficult to meet this second burden to show that you're able to prevail and so usually the motion will go through and and the speech will be allowed and as we said before it generally uh ends up in attorney's fees and costs when you prevail let's go ahead and flip to the next slide so as dan mentioned these these show up in a variety of different circumstances related to community association some some cases where there have been successful um dismissals of lawsuits alleging defamation range from a manager's claim for defamation arising out of an owner's letter published in a newsletter and statements made at a board meeting again that was that case was dismissed even though the manager felt that they were being defamed because it was relating to matters of public interest and in a public forum the case said it's protected speech and it's allowed to go forward they did not we're not able to prove defamation to the level that was necessary to stop or take action on that other examples i'm not going into too much detail in some of these but an owner's submission of a formal complaint to the association about blocked views was determined uh to be protected speech accusations of improper activities by candidates and i see some of this in some of the the questions but accusations of improper activities by candidates made during annual meetings may be protected may be considered to be protected activity again public interest matters of public interest in an association election in an association is certainly a matter of public interest to that uh community uh and again has to write it gets protected and unless you can prove that high burden uh necessary that you're actually going to win and show balance let me jump in on that one with a little bit more factual facts that was a prior board member that was campaigning against somebody who was trying to uh get reelected where the prior board member accused the person up for reelection of absconding with uh with association funds uh criminal activity and then there was an accusation back well while you were on the board you did such and such and stole this money and so both of them were alleging that the other one committed a criminal act but it ended up being the situation where the the anti-slap was involved and was successful because of the situation in which it arose it was right before the the uh the annual meeting in a situation where they were actively complaining campaigning against each other and the entire association was seeing it in the context of uh candidates uh abilities for uh being elected so even though there there would be what would otherwise be libel per se it was still considered protective speech in this part in this context again definitely a matter of public interest and uh protected speech uh attorney response to an owner's anonymous newsletter accusing the board member of malfeasance that let that response that anonymous letter was pretty deemed to be protected speech and a cross complaint has was dismissed in a case where for defamation based on a letter sent to the membership reporting on details of ongoing litigation that's the case dan mentioned earlier that litigation disclosure that gets sent out is a matter of public interest uh certainly i'm going to assume what was in the letter was accurately was true as long as the lawyer depicted it so again another defense to a defamation suit and and was dismissed in the ants based on the anti-slap motion because the uh plaintiff was not able to prove that they were going to win the case so the anti-slap motion is very powerful and very dangerous in defamation lawsuits because it doesn't allow for an award of attorneys fees and it very quickly can resolve a case uh if it's if it's granted at the at the outset again it has to be filed at the outset it has to be filed within 60 days of the complaint of the response time so you have a very small window to try to eliminate the lawsuit and get rid of it get rid of it based on the andy slap motion let's go ahead and go to the next slide and we're going to talk about we've been talking about defamation but what about harassment that's not just defamation but actually threats of violence and what options are available then so we talked about a little bit before the the various definitions of of harassment at the beginning and those were coming out of the circumstances of the restraining order statutes and there are various types of restraining orders that those statutes allow and and they're very very different in terms of who can bring them what the requirements are uh and and how long that they're in place uh and before i jump into this the physical violence portion there was a discussion a little bit earlier there's a difference between a regular civil harassment restraining order that's brought by individuals protect themselves and this type of what's considered a workplace violence restraining order and i think that the two key differences are in the civil harassment area it's brought by an individual based on what we talked about earlier being the established course of conduct against that individual you have to show a pattern not just an individual type but a pattern of this type of of harassing activity and it doesn't have to be violence it doesn't have to be threats of violence it could be as we talked about before stalking or or yelling or or always looking into somebody's window on occasion um not occasion over a continued period of time um but that is brought by an individual on behalf of themselves what we're going to talk about now with with this portion with the workplace violence restraining order in situations where there is violence or there is threats of violence then at that point the association can step in and do it on behalf of others they can do it on behalf as an employer they can seek to protect their board members their committee members members of the landscaping committee direct employees or independent contractors that perform services at the association so we were dealing with one a little bit ago that's an on-site manager that was consistently being yelled and threatened at well the board can step in and say hey look stop threatening our our manager um they're engaging in services on behalf of the association and seek a restraining order against that individual to protect the manager um again it includes board members includes committee members uh it also is broad enough that if there are circumstances where we need to seek it on behalf of a board member it extends to their family members or their household members not just those individuals once you have the triggering individual that's protected you can then protect their family as well what does not allow you to do this well we talked about various uh communications and complaints against the board member or the management manager when they're conducting their duties that doesn't rise to this level this one specifically requires uh threats of violence or violence itself before we can then step in and and uh attempt to protect those individuals how long does it last well the port can grant it up to three years uh we just went into the court a little bit after this a little bit ago on one that we uh received three years ago the conduct has still it's still at the level where their the protection is needed to be there so we went in and had it renewed for another three years so you can go in and continue that um the difficulty with this one is that most courts do not allow recovery of attorneys fees on this because they see it as being brought on by the employer rather than uh an individual who might not have the the funds in order to be able to protect themselves and so most courts will not allow the association to recover attorney's fees on on this type of situation connor if you want to switch to the next slide we won't go uh much into this one it'll be quick but there's another category that specifically deals with individual 65 or an older elder abuse restraining order uh it protects the broader category it's not just threats of violence but it also includes any type of mental or emotional or even financial abuse this one can go for up to up to five years uh attorney's fees are allowed in this circumstance uh and before we switch to the next slide what happens if you get the restraining order and the person doesn't uh doesn't comply well call the police right at this point when these are in place uh law enforcement can come in and enforce it it then becomes a potential misdemeanor they can be charged with a crime and then uh or you can go to your attorneys and say hey this is occurring and we can then go into the courts and get a civil contempt action and the the court will either uh have some type of a criminal impact as far as potential jail time or find them up to a thousand dollars so once you have this keep it in your pocket and work with your your attorneys to make sure that it is enforced if it doesn't automatically solve the problem and most of the time it does okay i'm going to just go through our last couple slides very quickly here because we're ending up on time but i just want to comment on the fact that you don't have to tolerate bad behavior uh in board meetings and dealing with homeowners i would encourage you to get counsel involved if you have someone who is consistently and habitually um sending letters or communications and using vulgar language and addressing with the board i'd also encourage you to draft or consider drafting meeting rules uh to address a home run or open forum to make sure that they're not interrupting the board during the the rest of the board meeting and have some parameters you are going to allow them to speak but to have some parameters as to how they speak uh and and say hey look if you're using vulgar language or threatening people we're going to kick you out of the meeting so i dropped some board rules uh go ahead and connor go the next the next slide uh again these are some of the types of speech that you may want to include in those rules threats of harm or violence fighting words defamatory statements during the meeting you may want to try to move those along and certainly profanity go ahead and conquer the next one and i'm going to say you know a lot of the questions we get and i'm gonna see and i see them even the question to answer is hey what can we do to stop these people from uh saying these bad things about us and my advice is always rather than trying to stop it and you've heard how difficult it can be if you're trying to stop defamation because of the public interest and nature of these uh statements and where they're occurring is to counter speech with more speech develop a communication strategy implement a social media and communications policy where you tell people this is we're going to go where we are going to put out the official accurate information from the association really try to increase transparency with newsletters in your own social media posts that are outgoing only uh rather than addressing comments and address issues uh generally rather than responding directly to individuals um on social media come up with a strategy where the board takes a question and says and develops an answer that goes out from the board as a whole speak as with one voice i try to put that communication out there again communication is key how what good the board is doing to address those issues and try to counter the speech that's being heard from the people that are complaining and about the association i think that's it from our perspective so thank you for attending and uh uh listening to us today i guess with dave back to you at this point for questions and answers that's right back to me so hey you guys been wonderful thanks for answering all those questions uh and i want to thank uh the audience for uh sending in so many we have 40 or so left so we do have time we have 10 or 15 minutes more to go uh that you can you can take some of these questions so uh start reading through a few of those uh i do want to say that we're we're very happy to have this session sponsored by cid consortium llc uh they've done their big supporter of uh echo and uh we very much appreciate their contribution and supporting uh the question and answer period so why don't we go ahead and take some more uh questions here uh i can take a look at some of them i know dan you're going to be doing some and you know pull out a couple of these that you think are good there were there was one question about cameras and the the potential of that being harassment uh the use of cameras in a community uh sometimes it's not really harassment but it's invasion of privacy so it's a little different and then there's the use of cameras by a neighbor looking into another neighbor's you know garage or does the hoa have any culpability about that so if you wouldn't mind maybe kicking it off with that i'd appreciate it sure so the issue of cameras is one i i our recommendations always develop you have to have something to enforce right so first of all if it's attached to association maintained property remove it because you should you shouldn't allow things to be attached to association maintain property if it's screwed into a fascia you probably can create some water moisture issues and increase maintenance obligate costs so i would tell the homeowner you've done put this into an area that's in common area you need to remove it and we're going to charge you for the cost of damaging the common area if it is uh if we're talking about a single-family home or an exclusive used common area where a homeowner has installed a camera without in in in a way that manages or damages the common area i generally would encourage the association to adopt or develop and adopt camera surveillance camera rules which talk about the fact that it it's okay what happens in the street and what's visible from the street uh is is public there's no right of privacy in what happens on the street the right of privacy is when you would have a reasonable expectation of privacy if somebody's filming or recording then you may have an issue so the rules should be developed that say cameras can't be affixed in ways that record or view into areas where the homeowners have a reasonable expectation of privacy such as into their into their home uh or in their backyard uh and we would typically require that the once the camera is installed the homeowners send us a screenshot to show the view the angle that the camera is obtaining and also require that the camera cannot be panned or tilted so that it can't be moved that's the it's stationary in that way uh that's how how we would typically recommend to address cameras uh because yes if it's filming into an area where there's a reasonable expectation of privacy um you can take some action to address it and develop rules for that but again yeah that's probably not harassment that may be more of a nuisance yeah one of the questions i had from from a member was can they use it for uh photo for taking pictures of people coming in and out of the community so there was a gated community and they wanted to take the uh shot of the uh the license plates too is that uh okay that and we're talking about the association uh if it's in the public there's no private privacy there's no expectation of privacy of who's coming and going in the association by gate now if a homeowner does it again not not an expectation of privacy if the association does it again we'd want to develop rules around who has access that recording um and so so that we don't want to you know you don't want to get involved in a situation which i haven't had to happen where a spouse was accusing their spouse of having an affair so they wanted the recording to see who was coming in and out while they were gone we don't want to get involved in that so yeah we're not going to have some rules and guidelines in places who can get access to the recordings and when okay sounds good okay um let me check and see what else we've got here um what sort of actions would warrant a cease and desist letter uh no that's very broad i mean again if it rises to the level of a nuisance uh certainly would require a cease and desist letter um if an owner is engaging or a resident is engaging in activity that constitutes harassment in relation to a protected class i would certainly recommend because now you're falling into the fair housing harassment that we talked about earlier i would recommend a cease and desist letter to that to that resident whoever that is whether they're owner or a tenant saying you are being accused of doing x you need to be aware that this constitutes housing discrimination it may violate the fair housing regulations your we demand you immediately insist such activity or you may face uh potential liability for violation of fair housing regulations good so here's an interesting one regarding elections an owner attacks and targets candidates for board election and campaign against them with false accusations he does this to uh he does this too during board meetings his election profile also attacks her um and another board member the president is allowed the president allows it claiming free speech she loves it because she is not being attacked dan why don't you take this one because this is similar to that one you were talking about earlier well i think we've gone through elections outside of the association context where there's all sorts of untruths that are being thrown against either of the candidates or truth for that matter and it's difficult to know what's what why is all of that allowed well it's in the context of political speech so in these circumstances it might not be true it might be true even if we know or have a very good idea that it's not true again keep in mind that it's it's it's in the context of the type of public figure where it requires that additional heightened standard so so it would be very difficult to show that there is any type of defamatory contact and again we had that one case where uh where even even the libel per se situation where it was accusing somebody of a crime because it was in the context of this this type of uh campaigning situation it it wasn't something that was going to be actionable and the the motion for anti-slap was was uh upheld so in in the circumstances where people are complain companioning against each other i think it goes back to what robert was saying earlier that the best answer to that is to fight communication with better communication because it's not necessarily something that you'd be able to fight legally as as easily okay um it i'm looking at the clock here it's making me a little nervous uh do you uh you you two okay with maybe staying a little a little a few minutes longer is that sure we can we can say about another ten minutes or so that'd be that'd be great uh we appreciate it i'm sure uh and if you are uh attending uh you know feel free to leave uh at any time uh the um it would be helpful for the participants if you could use the thumbs up uh designation on the bottom left corner of the question box and vote on the uh questions you would like to to have answered first from the group there are 43 questions uh that have been answered and that have not that have been asked but not answered so this just helps us a little bit with respect to you know how to deal with the questions uh here's a real quick one from from raul um uh let's see okay i just lost it let me go up to the top here make it a little easier on me uh is a board of director uh legally responsible if they actually observe the perpetrators abuse of a victim we're talking about in a fair housing context part of the standard is whether the board knew or should have known so certainly if a director sees it uh sees it occurring and it and it does fall within the harassment requirements for fair housing meaning it's related to protective class yes potentially that would be something that would definitely trigger that that fair housing investigation and possible possible action is is uh would they be held liable personally if they see something like that potentially if the board took no action there is there is potential personal liability for directors under fair housing okay are board of directors allowed to serve if they actually have a restraining order against them i guess that depends on the nature of the restraining order there's not a disqualification to serving on a board if you have a restraining order uh you may have to serve via zoom i actually had many many years ago a director who was tried and convicted of murder but even though he was in jail he had not he was still serving on the board there was not a grant to disqualify him so he would call in from jail so some of the interesting things we do um until the workings of action a situation where even in the context of an owner that had a restraining order against them they are still permitted to attend board meetings and have that right unless the court orders otherwise but if the court doesn't then then accommodations have to be made in order to allow that person to participate because they have that that membership right to do so yeah i think one of the things that's come out of covet is some of those those issues are going to be much more easily dealt with now even though we could have done it before we're a lot more comfortable with teleconferences and meetings here's a here's a question i get asked a lot it says here about board members now board members there's often a board member that's a little uh different than the other ones and has different opinions but they constantly are criticizing their members and the board members they're making comments about the general manager or the management firm constantly doing that valid or invalid but they continue to do that uh how would you deal with that um in terms of trying to get that board member under control that's a tough one because that's very clearly if that what we're talking about in terms of the criticisms relate to the matter of public interest certainly as a director um they have a right to express their opinion that's part of their obligation right the fiduciary duty is to sit at a board meeting and investigate and participate in the board process you can have a code of ethics and a code of conduct for the board again if they refuse to sign it you get into this that well how enforceable is that but having those rules set up in place so that you can have a productive board meeting allow everyone to express their opinion encourage them not to do it in a way that is vulgar or demeaning because now especially if it's demeaning you may get into that workplace harassment unfair under the fair housing employment harassment guidelines so that's a concern and we may have to counsel them now i saw a comment earlier on about well clearly the legal counsel isn't advising them because they continue to do it i wish that was the case uh you know we we can take the horse of water we can't force them to drink we need more power so it's a matter of trying to work with them to to try to encourage them to be productive with their comments that that has sometimes sit down with them and say look i understand you're upset i understand you have issues the way you're doing this is not necessarily productive um can we find a better way for you to express your opinions but not being demeaning or we're going to use it when we use the word harassment even though it's not maybe not technically harassment in the way you would the way you do it yeah one of the one of the distinctions you made is between if it's a workplace does that mean they have to be an employee or hired uh to be considered part of the workers if you will and the board of course has a superior relationship because they tell those people what to do is that different than within the within the uh the board of directors themselves and with the members themselves no i mean if i understand your question correctly dave no i mean the fact is you're creating a hostile enviro work environment that even though it's a volunteer situation right because because they are serving on the board um they are essentially deemed to be the employer even though it's not technically the employer they have control over those people great so be careful about that and i i get calls like this all the time and i'm always telling them do you have code of conduct or you know some ethics procedure or policy that you have and and frankly you can rely on that if you can get it passed uh you can rely on that to try to help the situation correct here's another quick one uh our manager claims harassment if anyone criticizes a correct questions his performance uh on any issue uh or contract items he claims workforce hostility um what's your thought on that one how to deal and that's six people wanted to to get an answer to that one so it's a popular question uh that is a remember that slide where i said what's issue number what the first thing you do work with council what's the second thing you do work with council uh work with council and that's a very that's gonna be very factually specific in your situation uh and try to deal with that relationship because they're gonna be factors there that we just can't generally uh speak to i think yeah and i think i think one of the things to do is when you uh when you're if you or if you're writing a new contract with a management firm is make sure you have your counsel involved with it but stipulate what you can talk about with them and what's their job and what somebody else's job is another thing is there is a governance form called policy governance that helps uh create that definition between what the board responsibility is versus what the manager's responsibility and so there are techniques to address it but it's uh it's messy any way you deal with it yeah i prefer to to just if you get a new management contract write it into the management contract um and it's very clear that if it's if it's a worker an employee of the organization then you have um a much different situation right okay as a board uh see as a board member i uh an owner owning um bounces around an owner coming to my door mask list during the covet uh aggressively threatening to sue or harass due to board decisions related to her actions violating a rule isn't this in itself potentially harassment when the community has a property manager and holds monthly board meetings for owners to express concerns joe wants to know the answer is is that clear uh it's so if i if i understand the question what we're talking about is a homeowner coming to a board member's home aggressively to complain well first thing is if you have concerns about physical safety anybody coming on your door immediately i would encourage you to call the police that's the first step uh the second step is is it uh harassing uh potentially it may be potentially it may be and that may be something we certainly get legal counsel involved a cease and desist letter uh would certainly be appropriate in that context uh we would certainly try to get the tell the homeowner look you have no right to come to the board members home uh and express your opinion your the opportunity for you to come and address the board is at the board of mediator and homeowner forum or you could submit your your issues in writing to management who will then make them available for the board to review and consider okay do you all have uh questions favorites that you see on your screen there let me take a look uh we covered that one can the board send a cease and desist along with a penalty if the person is not aware of the problem you have to call you can send a cease and desist letter to advise them of the issue and demand that they stop the activity and then you'd have to call them to a notice hearing uh and and find tie it into some violation of the governing documents if you're going to find them probably a nuisance in that question in that in that regard okay that sounds that sounds good i think we'll i think we'll just go ahead and uh move on and uh you know thank you so much uh for your uh your participation i think you did a great job a lot of questions a lot of involvement with with everyone here um so um you did
