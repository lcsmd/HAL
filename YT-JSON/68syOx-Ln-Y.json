        "transcript": "I've had a few requests to cover gas lighting \non this channel and I think it's a really great   topic for a couple of reasons one it's universal \nall of us who have been in emotionally abusive   relationships have encountered gas lighting on \nsome level and two it's very commonly confused   because there are a lot of things that go into \ngas lighting and it's not one specific action so   in this video we're going to explore what is gas \nlighting who uses gas lighting and why they do it   and then we're gonna wrap it up with some tips \nto help you start to overcome the gas lighting   that you've experienced in your relationships so \nif you're ready let's jump in my name is Christina   and on this channel we explore narcissistic \nabuse its connection with spirituality and we   attempt to answer the question where do we go \nfrom here so if that all sounds good to you be   sure you're subscribed and hit that notification \nbell so you can be notified whenever I post new   videos if you're already subscribed thank you and \nwelcome back so what is gas lighting it's kind of   a funny term for what it actually describes right \nif you've never heard the origins before you're   probably wondering where did that even come from \nso it came from a 1938 play that was later made   into a movie the play was named Gaslight and \nit was about a husband and wife the husband was   abusive and he was attempting to make his wife \nlook and feel crazy like she's lost her mind   so a few of the things he would do is you know he \nwould hide things around the house and there were   times where he would go up to the attic to rummage \naround for valuable and while he did this remember   it's 1938 so he would turn on a light and attic \nand like gas life and the rest of the house would   dim and flicker and when the wife brought this up \nhe made her feel like she was crazy like it wasn't   actually happening she saw it with her own eyes \nbut he made her question her sense of reality her   own perception of what was real and what wasn't \nand so this is where the true gas lighting comes   from and it describes the emotionally manipulative \nNiq that people use to make you question your own   perception of reality and when it's extreme it \ncan make you question your your own sense of   sanity it's incredibly devious and unfortunately \nit's something that usually happens over a long   period of time it can be subtle and it can \nbe very overt in your face and it's usually   layered there are usually many layers to the \ngas line and all of these things contribute to   to make it unfortunately an effective technique \nof keeping people under control so who uses gas   lighting most often you're going to find that it \nis narcissist sociopaths Psychopaths cluster B   personalities emotionally abusive people but with \nthat said just because someone is gas lighting you   doesn't mean that they have a personality disorder \nanyone who's hiding something might use some gas   lighting techniques they might make you try to \nquestion your perception of reality because your   perception of reality is the truth that they don't \nwant you to see and that is why people use gas   lighting but it goes a little bit deeper because \nthe reason why they don't want you to see reality   is usually because they want or need to keep you \nunder control so in the case of a narcissist whose   gas lighting let's say you are their main source \nof supply they don't want to lose you they have to   keep you on the hook so if they're lying about \nsomething and you catch them in a lie they're   very likely to use gas lighting techniques to make \nyou question your perception of reality so you go   into it knowing that they're lying you go into it \nknowing that they've told you a lie but you walk   out of it questioning whether they're lying and \nwondering if you can trust your own senses so how   do we identify a gas lighting when we speak of it \nin the broad theft the definition of gas lighting   if you haven't encountered it you might think well \nwhy would anyone fall for that but in reality when   you're in these situations when you're in an \nabusive relationship and someone is gas lighting   you it be very confusing and it's meant to be \nconfusing so what is gas lighting and what isn't   gas lighting there are at least four hallmark \nbehaviors that are present when you are in a   situation where somebody's trying to Gaslight you \nand the first one is repeated lying so you catch   somebody in a lie and what do they do to cover up \ninstead of coming clean they lie again and maybe   they lie again and the second sign goes hand in \nhand with that denial of evidence you may say   well I saw you do this and you may come back with \nno you didn't you didn't see that that wasn't me   or you just you just don't know what you saw you \nthink you you didn't actually see it and they come   they may come back at you with with supporting \nevidence - so we'll remember this other time that   you thought you saw this thing and it wasn't that \nthing well this could be like that - and this is   how over time gas lighting can build at the very \nleast it will eat away at your confidence and and   your ability to trust yourself the third sign of \ngas lighting is misdirection so you're having a   conversation about one thing and the emotionally \nabusive person that you're talking to changes   the subject and again this is one where you would \nthink well I would see that happening but remember   these people they know better than anyone how to \npush your buttons and there are a few ways that   they can use misdirection to get you talking about \nsomething else one they could do something that's   kind of related they can shift just a very slight \nshift of the conversation so that you're talking   about something slightly different but related \nor another way they can use in this direction is   by bringing up something that they know triggers \nyou bringing up a conversation that maybe you've   brought up a hundred times before and they've \nnever really wanted to discuss it so now's your   chance now they're bringing up this other topic \nthat they've never wanted to talk about before   it's always been off-limits suddenly suddenly \nit's okay to talk about as long as you're not   talking about this other thing so misdirection \nyou can think of kind of like a verbal sleight   of hand don't look over here look over there and \nthe board sign that you are dealing with somebody   who's gaslighting you is contradiction they will \noften contradict themselves in the same discussion   it could be the same conversation maybe even in \nthe same sentence they will contradict themselves   and then they will convince you that they haven't \ndone so because the more they get you defending   yourself the the more you're going to believe that \nyou need to be on the defensive there's a concept   that's often used in sales it's called a yes \nletter once you can get somebody to say yes once   to something really really simple like a phone \ncall if you can get somebody to willingly say   yes and want to do something then the idea is that \nit's easier and easier to get them to say yes you   build up to your big ask now this conversational \nconfusion is kind of like that so the emotionally   abusive person uses misdirection and they use all \nthese techniques they use word salad to get you to   doubt yourself within the conversation to get you \nto doubt that you even can follow the conversation   and that you even know what you're talking about \nso if you can't follow the conversation and you   don't even know what you're talking about then \nhow could you know this other thing that this   person is trying to keep from you if you can \ndoubt one little thing and then another thing   and then another thing they'll just keep going \nand they'll keep building the confusion until   you finally doubt the big thing so as I've \nkind of touched on before there are so many   different layers to gaslighting and it's really an \ninsidious tactic if it's awful because this is the   big component that gets you to question your your \nsanity and your your ability to make decisions and   this eats away at your your sense of self and your \nself-esteem and it makes you feel like you need to   be dependent on someone in order to make decisions \nor to do anything and gaslighting it can be very   very obvious in your face like again the example \nI wear I saw you do this and then the person says   well no no that's not what you saw you didn't see \nthat at all where they're just blatantly lying to   your face or it can be very subtle like with the \nword salad technique where they're just trying to   confuse you and often you'll experience all these \nlayers within the same relationship so if you've   experienced gas lighting in your relationship or \nin any relationship over a period of time you're   likely to exhibit one or more of these signs so \nfirst you always doubt yourself and that just   comes naturally with being with somebody who's \nconstantly making you question your perception of   reality this second is that you're excusing your \npartner's behavior and there are a few reasons why   this happens in emotionally abusive relationships \nand gaslighting it's a big one because not only   are you being gaslighted about the little things \nthat are going on on the day to day or even the   big things but this person is also gaslighting you \nabout the the entirety of it about the idea that   it's abuse so you've questioned your perception of \nreality for so long on so many different things on   so many different levels that it's difficult for \nyou to say well this person was abusive towards   me when you've experienced gaslighting over an \nextended period of time you're more likely to   believe the reality that someone else is feeding \nyou so when you talk to other people you're very   likely to hide the more abusive things that this \nperson has done because you know it will change   the other person's perception of the abuser \nand this is a pretty clear sign that there   is gaslighting going on one of the reasons why \nsharing this information would change someone's   perception of the abusive person is because the \nabusive person's reality that you've accepted   doesn't hold up in actual reality so when you \ntell somebody what's going on and even if you   use all of the excuses and and all of the the \nlogic and the reasoning that the abusive person   has that you and maybe you have even accepted it \nas truth it's not going to hold up in real reality   when someone else hears it they're going to see \nit for what it what did it and I can tell you   in my own experience that this was 100% true for \nme I knew I I did not talk about a lot of things   that were going on and when I finally did when I \nfinally talked about the more abusive things that   had happened and at the time I wasn't labeling it \nas abuse I couldn't but everyone I talk to dick   everyone I talk to you when I finally got it out \nthere literally every person I talked to you said   Christina that's emotional abuse and I'm talking \nabout all different types of people and you know   different conversations and me trying to give the \nother person the benefit of the doubt yeah but I   this and and yeah but here's the background \nsituation much to my surprise everyone else   saw what I didn't see so a third sign that someone \nis using gaslighting against you is that you lack   self-confidence you just you feel like you can't \nmake decisions on your own and the final sign that   you are being gaslighted is that you just don't \nhave the self-love that you did when you first   encountered this person or if it's somebody \nyou've known all your life you're just you're   struggling with self-love and you have a really \nnegative self-image that you can't seem to shake   so how to start overcoming the gaslighting \nyou've experienced first and foremost is   to distance yourself from the emotionally abusive \nperson who has been gaslighting you so this means   going no-contact or gray rock I mentioned earlier \nthat not everyone who uses gaslighting is and are   sociopaths Psychopaths or even a chronically \nabusive person but if you notice a pattern and   if you're here I'm guessing you do it's time to \nstart distancing yourself from the person who's   abusing you so that you can heal the second thing \nyou can do is start talking about what's happening   or what has happened and if you can talk to a \nprofessional counselor somebody who has experience   with emotional abuse another thing you can do is \nbecome aware of your own self-talk so how do you   talk about yourself to other people and in your \nown head so are you in a place where if you do   something that you're not really happy about you \nmight say oh I'm so stupid I'm such an idiot and   that's a common thing that a lot of people in our \nsociety say but just become aware of it because   that's not productive and it's not going to help \nyou build up your sense of self-esteem another   thing that's important to do after you've realized \nthat you've encountered gaslighting is to set   boundaries with the person who was gaslighting \nyou super important and it's also an important   part of distancing yourself from this person so \nno contact or gray rock boundaries are super super   important so if you found this video helpful \nplease let me know by hitting that like button   and if
