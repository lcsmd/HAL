        "transcript": "I [Music] good morning everyone thank you for your patience my name is joyce coleman i'm the executive director of the vasculitis foundation i'd like to thank you for joining us today we are glad you could join us on this givingtuesday as you may have heard i just a few housekeeping items before we begin please make sure you click full screen in the upper right hand corner of your laptop screen in order to capture the optimal screen resolution for today's presentation we have been gathering questions via social media and email and you can also submit questions through the question box after dr. Wexler's presentation he will be doing Q&A with the audience so please keep track of your questions and then we'll try to get as many of them answered as possible I just wanted to this webinar was a it was the brainchild the Suzanne de Paulus who's a member of the VF Board of Directors she has a GPA and as an active member of the online e GPA community she's not able to join us today which is she really wanted to so she just wanted to say hello to everyone and also express her thanks for you guys joining us so today's presenter is dr. Michael Wexler he is a pulmonologist in the division of pulmonary critical care and sleep medicine at national Jewish Hospital in Denver his areas of research include eg PA asthma any awesome familiy lung diseases I'd like to welcome you dr. Wexler and thank you for making time for this presentation you have the floor sure it's great to be here this morning I'm sorry we started a few minutes late due to some technical issues but it's great to be here what I thought would be helpful would be to go through a little bit about EGP a Nephila granulomatosis with polyangiitis and and then review some of the diagnostic features workup measure and then take most of time for questions so thank you for the introduction Joyce as mentioned I work at national Jewish which is a pulmonary hospital in Denver I've been here for six and a half years and before that I was in Boston at Brigham and Women's Hospital and pretty much my entire career over the last 21 22 years has focused on eosinophils lung conditions but particularly Nephila granulomatosis with polyangiitis and also asthma yes anagh philic asthma in particular and I what I'm excited about is the fact that things have changed so much in the last 20 years since I first saw my first patient with this disease entity 20 years ago and and how things have evolved in that now we finally have a medication that's approved for the management of this disease and I think it's really had a huge impact to have new therapies available for management of this disease so so I should just disclose that I have worked with several pharmaceutical companies and it received honoraria from several pharmaceutical companies are listed here what I'd like to start off is obviously just defining what a GPA is new GPA is as many of you know yes nephila granulomatosis with polyangiitis it was previously known as churg-strauss syndrome it was also known as allergic ng itis and granulomatosis and it is a disease entity that was first described by Jacob Turk and Lahti Straus in the 50s initially as allergic NGOs and granulomatosis in an autopsy series of people who died from severe asthma where rhinosinusitis high-heeled sandals and pneumonia and they were found on autopsy also to have asthma philic arteritis inflammation of the arteries and granulomas or scar tissue in multiple organs and what was important to recognize at the time was initially it was just a pathologic diagnosis characterized really by the asthma and the eosinophilia but over time it's become recognized as a lot more than and it's now recognized primarily as an eosinophil across colitis and it gets seen by several different disease specialty specialties including hematologists who see people for the east an affiliate rheumatologists or see people for the vasculitis pulmonologist an allergist who see people for the asthma component and the allergic component a neurologist for the neuropathy and ear nose and throat specialist for the sinus abnormalities and then whatever other organs may be involved including cardiologist gastroenterologist nephrologist and so it's important for people to recognize this entity it's a disease characterized by yes anagh philic vasculitis and the vast majority of patients have moderate severe asthma everyone by definition needs to have had at one point blood eosinophils and then neuropathy is common in about half of patients at pulmonary infiltrates on just x-ray sinus abnormality is very common 90% of patients and then yes Milic vasculitis is one of the key features another key feature is the presence of anti neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies which occurs in somewhere around 30 to 40 percent of patients that have this disease and today when I first saw this disease about 20 years ago I recognized that it was an interesting disease because it was at the Nexus of asthma yes Nephila and vasculitis and that's really where a GPA fits in it's got features of all those entities it's an East metallic lung condition it does have vasculitis it does have the Asuna philia but it's its own entity and it's its own entity within a group of hyper eosinophils syndromes and I think that's another important thing to recognize because part of the differential diagnosis of hypertrophic syndromes is EGP a versus some of the other myeloproliferative or lymphoproliferative disorders one of the key features of e GPA is the presence of lung is an affiliate and on the bottom slide you can see many of these pink pink cells that are infiltrating into the tissue here those are eosinophils the pink granular protein associate with USFL's can be seen as well in the upper left hand slide as well you can see these pink clusters of cells those are eosinophils that are infiltrating into the tissue in these disease disease patients it's a rare vasculitis and it's vasculitis that's characterized by occurring quite infrequently in the general population two to four cases per million individuals per year maybe up to six per million per year and so there are probably about 500 new cases a year in the United States and children it's actually quite rare there have been you know now 20 to maybe 30 case reports in the literature of of cases in in kids and an adolescence but it does occur but it's quite rare but since about 20 years ago there have been increased reports of EGP a particularly in association with asthma therapies leukotriene modifiers as well as anti IgE therapy inhaled steroids and an asthma population it's actually much more comments about 60 to 80 cases per million patient ears question becomes is how rare is e G PA well I mentioned the data is saying as you know two to six per to six per general population two to six cases per million people in general population but in asthma population we've identified the case report is a post closer to 75 to 80 cases per million in an asthma population and we did a study looking at the incidence of shirk stress this is now published about 13 years ago we looked at several health maintenance organizations and we identified that in a general population of asthma drug users it was around 35 per million person-years with a higher instance people aged 50 to 69 and but there's probably still significant underreporting of this entity because physicians will recognize it most patients most physicians don't know what this is they've never heard of or they heard of but forgotten what trig stress syndrome is they certainly haven't heard of es nephila granulomatosis with polyangiitis so it's on us to educate them and in addition in addition the poor phys and recognition is probably still underreported because there are many patients who get treated with systemic steroids either for severe asthma or for other entities and they don't get recognized as having the es nephila component or the vasculature component and there's also other new drugs like higher dose inhaler corticosteroids that make well some of the eg PA symptoms now there have been several clinical and pathological areas that have been used to define you GPA in nineteen eighty four Lanham said that you have a GPA if you've got asthma yes an affiliate and vasculitis involving two organs in 1994 there was a Chapel Hill consensus conference in which they said you need to have a tissue diagnosis you need to have a sniffle rich granulomatous inflammation with necrotizing vasculitis and then there was the vasculitis classification criteria so this isn't diagnostic criteria but it's a vasculitis classification criteria that was identified by the American College of ecology and they said well if you have vasculitis then you will have a GPA if you have asthma yes an affiliate neuropathy pulmonary infiltrates sinus abnormality and eosinophils vasculitis or extravascular eosinophils and these criteria are in the context of vasculitis are almost 100% specific for you GPA and 85 percent sensitive in terms of capturing a diagnosis of e GPA we were part of a European rest storage society task force to help define this entity and we said that EGP should be defined as asthma plus es failure with at least two of the following either some biopsy showing us and philic vasculitis neuropathy pulmonary infiltrates sino nasal abnormalities cardiomyopathy lamella nephritis alveolar hemorrhage palpable purpura or anti neutrophils cytoplasmic antibodies and if you have this this constellation you have any two of these on top of Asmodeus and philia then you really have a GPA now EG PA said to evolve in a phase ik developmental pattern often time there's just an allergic diathesis so people have allergic rhinitis that progresses into asthma people also Stage two peripheral bloodiest Nephila yes no philic infiltration to various organs so high blood vehicles and then stage three is the terminal vascular stage I don't like these criteria this terminology I people come to me all the time and say you know what stage in my eye people can either skip through they can go backwards I think I find it quite negative to say that someone's in the terminal vascular ectasia because there can be reversibility of some of the eg PA features but it's important to recognize that you know the reason to recognize this pattern is just so that people can have an early sense when someone has high es since those people should be wary that there's a potential to develop vasculitis and that's the major point that the Atlanta and colleagues were trying to make most of these stages develop over years but they cannot also develop over weeks to months in terms of long term outcomes aren't a lot of good studies following people there but there was one about five years ago by Sampson and colleagues they followed 118 patients for six years they said of that cohort 90% lived at seven years and the people who were least likely to survive were those people were over 65 years of age 29% had long-term remission 10% of those patients died but by seven years and of those not in remission 57 percent were relapsing on less than 10 milligrams their prisons own and those who were not in remission were associated with ANCA and higher eosinophils as well as a higher prevalence of asthma and peripheral neuropathy now EG PA can affect many different organ systems including the rest or e-track the nervous system the heart the kidneys the GI tract the blood vessels in the skin in the respiratory tract it is associated with asthma but also pulmonary infiltrates there's potential for alveolar hemorrhage as well as sinusitis at the most common other side effects are general systemic symptoms people get fevers they have muscle aches a weight loss cardiac involvement occurs in about 50% of patients kidney involvement occurs in less than 50% of patients and then there can be GI tract involvement as well the skin is often how people make a diagnosis of a GPA and usually people presented with nodules in the underneath your skin or palpable purpura which can be seen down the bottom righthand a pardon that put of that patient sort of this raised reddish inflamed rash and these people if you biopsy the rash will have evidence of eosinophils and vasculitis there was a an analysis of a cohort also but five years ago three hundred and eighty-three patients that were follows over the course of 50 years respectively it said about 50% had neuropathy most the time people were diagnosed around age 50 half the patients had ear nose and throat abnormalities this is a little bit low compared to my practice where about 90% of your nose and throat abnormalities skin presentation about 40% pulmonary infiltrates and about 40% again lower than what I usually see as a pulmonologist and Carter myopathy occurs in one in six patients one of the key findings is the presence of yes sniffily and the lower threshold basic people say is greater than 10 percent or greater than a thousand but I've seen 80% eosinophils I've seen 20,000 30,000 ESM cells these generally actually respond quickly to therapy with steroids and or other therapies but some of the other lab features that we see included sedimentation rate C reactive protein IG rheumatoid factor and anti-nuclear antibodies as I mentioned anti neutrophils cytoplasmic antibody is generally positive in about 30 to 40 percent of patients and associated with kidney involvement nerve involvement and biopsy proven vasculitis there are two different types of ANCA P NK and c-anca it's usually a P NK that's involved in the GPA and it's usually incas more frequently seen with ear nose and throat abnormalities peripheral neuropathy less frequently with cardiac manifestations but is associated with increase in relapses now when I talk to rheumatologist I feel like they have a different perspective than I do in this entity they usually think of eg PA as a vasculitis that is associated happens to be associated with Nephila and asthma and ANCA and that a flare is a flare of vasculitis but from my perspective as a pulmonologist I view this says these are people who have asthma as opposed to vasculitis who happen to have yes miss Aleeah vasculitis and an Enka and a flare can be either a flare of their asthma or a flare of vasculitis I get into debates with several rheumatologists about this topic and I also recognize that there is a spectrum of disease that we want to try to recognize and people will present either with asthma may present with ESM philic pneumonia and there's probably some continuum between asthma yes metalic pneumonia and EG PA on the other extreme in terms of understanding what causes this well the etiology isn't that well known there are certainly autoimmune features there is the association of ANCA which causes ANCA bites the blood vessel walls causes chemotaxis or recruitment of inflammatory cells that then release their cellular toxins and you know there's possibly a genetic component we have identified a couple of families which there is some evidence of heritability but it's clearly a disorder of es NFL regulation of proliferation we've looked at some genetic studies and we haven't really identified any genes that are commonly seen identified any common mutations that are observed in this patient population and then there's the association with asthma there as in therapy so people often ask me what's Ania cynical well it's just kind of it's a kind of white blood cell and it's a white blood cell that is associated with inflammation eosinophils release a variety of different mediators they play a role in tissue immunity normally and they can they have all sorts of enzymes inside them that they release that can cause tissue damage and response to different stimuli and so what's going on in each EPA is there's several different theories but one theory is is that allergen will cause some kind of immune response that will activate different kinds of t-cells they'll activate both type T helper 2 cells as well as T helper 1 and T helper 17 cells when they activate T helper 2 cells those cause release of different mediators including interleukin 5 interleukin 5 activates the eosinophils that causes the tissue damage through activation of and release of es sniffle dr neurotoxin major basic protein in the SME Fela cation protein but it also th2 cells also release B cells which produce different antibodies including IgE IgG 4 and income and but th 1 and th 17 cells can also be produced and they can also cause tissue damage and inflammation and cause some of the granuloma formation as well as vasculitis but we're still working on the underlying mechanism as I mentioned one of the other causes of features is something called vascular endothelial growth factor dendritic cells are also involved so can i GG 4 and then there's the association with different asthma therapies we identified back twenty years ago and this is how I got into the business was identified several cases associate with leukotriene modifiers but also with inhaled steroids with some meteor on with anti re and these were all cases that were either coincidental in nature or that were either the patient's you know just started the medication as their disease was getting worse or it was due to tapering of steroids in the context of using these asthma therapies we didn't think that these drugs were directly causative of the eosinophilia or of eg PA now where does eg pgpa fit in terms of the broad differential of hypertrophic syndromes so there's a broad group of entities and you can see e.g PA in orange on the far right it's one of the associated conditions and it's really a disease entity in which there's a defined diagnosis with peripheral es an affiliate as opposed to many of these other entities all of which have high eosinophils and cause tissue damage and you've excluded infection but people can just make a lot of BS nfl's from their bone marrow the so called myeloproliferative patients or lymphoproliferative patients where people will have some other kind of t-cell rearrangement which will cause proliferation of il5 which will stimulate yes nfl's but there are other types of yes an affiliate including benign episodic and associated as well as overlaps syndromes but EGP is one of the associated conditions with the defined diagnosis so eg PA obviously needs to be distinguished from other nephila associated infections cancers drug reactions rheumatologic conditions as well as primary pulmonary yes no philic syndromes including acute eosinophilic pneumonia chronic yeast infection pneumonia and the hyperthermophilic syndrome and what differentiates eg PA from these is generally the present strong presence of asthma and allergies the presence of vasculitis the presence of ANCA oftentimes cardiac involvement of the ODE that can be seen in type Rios neglect syndromes as well neurologic involvement and oftentimes it requires entity therapies other than corticosteroids so what's the diagnostic workup for eg pa well did routine evaluation is just identified that there yes NFL's identifying IgE levels tryptase levels sometimes bone marrow biopsy is helpful a cat scan of the chest or chest x-ray and then ruling out other infections using like Strongyloides antibody but to do a comprehensive workup for hai Princeton folks in drums really warrants visiting a hematologist and having a bone marrow biopsy done and then doing a whole series of tests that can help identify if there's no myeloproliferative lymphoproliferative or some other etiology or the eg pa I get often get asking one diagnose eg pa without presence of vasculitis well you don't need to have a definitive biopsy but you need to have bloodiest an affiliate you should have some form tissue yes Nephila and you can use other surrogate markers of disease including ANCA and EMG and you should also have asthma or some evidence of pulmonary infiltrates although it is theoretically possible Debi GPA without other significant pulmonary involvement and if there's no definitive vasculitis could be either possible or probably GP GPA need to follow these people closely to monitor for vasculitis so how do we manage people with eg PA well first of all we need to treat the underlying asthma and this is you know sometimes neglected by my Rheumatology colleagues but you know you need to continue bronchodilators and helps leukotriene modifiers like montelukast are not bad anti IG can reduce tissue as an affiliate and you need to remember to prophylaxis infection and bone loss and peptic ulcer disease but other than that you know historically the management has been steroids steroids and more steroids and usually you treat your the high dose for several months you need to treat early on they're effective in 90% of patients but and they work by inhibiting es FL colony growth but the problem is is that the disease often recurs as many people know as you withdraw steroids very few patients can get off of steroids not all patients respond to steroids initially and there's all the side effects of steroids steroids cause thinning of the skin weakening of the bones adrenal suppression growth suppression infections neuropsychiatric issues cataracts and glaucoma amongst other things so who can get Sera's alone well based on clinical experience milder patients so people who have no kidney gie heart or CNS involvement but the problem is that relapses can often occur at lower doses and you need to taper slowly so what do you do if a patient relapses on low dose steroids I usually bump up the steroid dose and if steroids alone don't work I you know what would you do if steroids alone don't work you need some kind of add-on therapy or if steroids can't be tapered then you need some kind of step-down therapy so those are the general three scenarios either people will relapse or steroids loans on working is something else or you can't get them off of corticosteroids so what do you do after steroids so these are historically what we've tried we've tried cyclophosphamide is a thigh print which are associated with a fair amount of toxicity and then other therapies including a matinee rituximab IVIG and TIG mycophenolate or cell sept methotrexate have all been tried but the problem is has there been almost no trials they've only been case reports just series and anecdotal evidence and some of the data is based on other vascular disease or on asthma and they're not even based on you GPA one of the most recent studies was published last year as a study look at adding either fibrin or in your end to Ramesh induction glucocorticoids for EG PA or other vasculitis and you can see here just by virtue of the fact that there's other disease entities that are involved and one of the interesting things that was seen was that if you look at his figure compared to a zetha proned versus placebo there was no significant difference between these entities the probability of remaining relapse tree remained about the same with days of thyrion-- over as placebo that's just that you could do pretty well just with placebo alone there was no decrease in treatment failures there was no decrease in relapse rate there was no decrease in steroid use and no improvement in asthma or science manifestations compared to placebo so I mean the cybron did okay but it didn't do any better than placebo in any of these key outcomes so what about targeting eosinophils and so the SFL is the major entity that's involved in you GPA hence the E and E GPA and it's there are many potential targets the one that's been targeted most is interleukin 5 because that's what causes eosinophils to degranulation caused them to release their mediators and causes eosinophils to become active and we published a paper just last year looking at methyl ism a poor placebo in patients with eg P a this was a multicenter study that was sponsored by both the National Institutes of Health as well as GlaxoSmithKline which was gracious enough to provide both support as well as drug for this study and one of the key features was that methyl ISM AB increased the time to first relapse and so you can see here was a small study there 136 patients this is a rare disease remember but 68 got drugged and 68 placebo and you can see that patients who were on placebo relapse much more quickly and with greater frequency compared to people who got mentalism AB then MEP ilysm have works by blocking il 5 it's a monoclonal antibody that binds IL 5 and therefore prevents some of us neglect activity was seen was yes the levels came down time to first relapse came down and the annual relapse rate also has decreased so on average patients have around two to three maybe four relapses a year with meppel ISM AB there was a 50% reduction in the relapse rate in terms of flares of eg PA whether their asthma flares or vasculitis flares about a 50% reduction in annualized relapse rate most important I think for patients was the fact that the daily median steroid dose was also reduced by about 50% you can see here in orange that the dose of nepotism have reduced by about 50% people started off around 11 milligrams 12 milligrams a day people got down to 5 milligrams day on average as opposed to placebo where they started off around 10 and they ended up around 10 or 11 milligrams a day so 50% reduction in steroid dose and about 20% of patients were able to come off of corticosteroids completely so EGP a is a complex syndrome characterized by asthma yes in philia sinus disease pulmonary infiltrates neuropathy and vasculitis and we've recognized that the essence of central D GPA pathophysiology we need to distinguish it from other yes/no philic disorders and an extensive workup should be performed when considering a diagnosis of e GPA and you should really refer to a specialist with the GP expertise there are several eg PA experts around the country or internationally as well but you know they're mostly based in academic medical centers and international Jewish obviously where I work but also at the University of Pennsylvania at Cleveland Clinic Mayo Clinic Harvard University California San Diego University Utah are among some of the other areas of expertise but you know there there is significant morbidity it can be challenging to treat you need to treat aggressively and there are now therapies that are needed to induce remission that are capable of inducing remission steroids are still first-line therapy they're effective many people but they're associated with other side effects so one does need to consider biologics and cytotoxic therapy in either steroid refractor disease step-down therapy or relapses and some of the questions that we're still trying to answer is what's the role of other anti áfive therapies such as Rizla's am AB or been realism AB those are two other anti il5 therapies that are currently available approved for use in village asthma and can anti il5 therapy be used as first-line therapy instead of steroids can it be used in acute presentation of you GPA can it be used without steroid use these are all important questions I think we need to try to understand we're still trying to understand the role of all these alternate therapies but now I think that you know I emphasize the fact that anti 5 is a bona fide therapy so I tried to give you a broad overview in a half-hour of eg PA I think we have about 23 minutes to answer some questions I'm happy to take some questions from the audience great dr. Wexler thank you so much for this excellent presentation and we will move directly to the questions Kaitlin young our network manager for the VPP RN and at becca our director of marketing they're gonna coordinate the questions which have been submitted either through social media email or the question box and if you do have questions please use the question box on in the menu on your right hand side so Kailyn do you want to start the questions sure well actually I mean I may defer to Ed because he has a couple that were submitted before the webinar and then there are several that are specific to new Carla as we move through some of the other ones that were already submitted so I do you want to do you want to address them of the ones that were submitted prior to the webinar sure and I would say most of these are about new Kalla and specifically so I'll jump in here and can my child get nuyk nuyk ala it's so if not why not so good question so you know Nicola I prefer use the generic term methyl ism AB I mean it was approved by the FDA for for eg PA it's also proved for yes if you like asthma the approval in eg PA was in those 12 and up and so depending on the age it may be feasible one can always work even if even if a drug is not approved one could try to use the drug off-label and work with one's insurance company I treat primarily adults there might need to be some kind of dose adjustment or something to be considered by people again that's an off-label question but there there's no meppel ISM AB is is approved down to age 12 there are some pediatric studies ongoing in asthma and so I don't see a reason why your chocolatier that they're above age 12 would not be eligible for this therapy but you know it's a safe it's an effective drug there do need to be more studies in the pediatric population okay thank you and this is probably the most asked question from the face book and that is can I stop taking all of my other medications if Nacala works for me yeah so that's an important question so there's a broad range of medications that people take and I would not recommend an abrupt stopping of any medications when starting new Kalla if it's working well and I would say you should talk to your physician and decide which therapies can be tapered whether it's the oral steroids whether it's the other immunosuppressants if you're on mycophenolate or if you're on is a thigh print I would do it with a great amount of caution because there might be other ancillary benefits of those drugs and there may be increased potential for adverse effects if you taper those therapies too quickly so I would be quite cautious in terms of doing that now do that under the supervision of a physician who knows your case well okay thank you another one can you be on new kala and Rituxan at the same time are there any Studies on this and why would I want or not want to be on both meds simultaneously yeah so there are no studies there is a potential for interaction of these medications and so you know I would again approach this situation with a significant amount of caution these drugs do work differently so methyl is a map blocks il5 and blocks eosinophils the rituximab buying blocks b-cell activity and will prevent antibody formations you know if the toxin AB is working then you know maybe you don't want to stop it in the other hand maybe if you start someone on methyl ISM AB you perhaps could potentially consider stopping the rituximab as well if it seems to be working well indeed we don't have any good answers vasn't been studied there is the potential for interactions you want to be cautious about tapering or stopping one medication or another and I would you know again take this up with specialists with a fair amount of expertise okay thank you okay a few more questions how can I be sure if the symptoms I am having are my EGP a or an ekala side-effect good question you know methyl is members generally pretty safe therapy so it depends on what the potential symptoms are ones experiencing if they're a new symptom and things were otherwise stable before starting the nipple is med that it possibly be related to the methyl is mad but I would encourage anybody who is having you know new symptoms while on metal is have to report that to the drug company because otherwise how will they know and how would people like me know that things are occurring so we do rely and you know some type of post marketing surveillance madenda phi which symptoms are related to to that or an alternative what I could get commonly get asked is how do I know whether or not my symptoms are related to the underlying disease or to the corticosteroids that I'm taking and steroid side-effects or steroid tapering and adrenal suppression again very difficult to to evaluate you need to take a good detailed history occasionally check cortisol levels amongst other things okay thank you and these are the three questions but they're they're all related and it has to do with fertility will new kala affect my future fertility can I use during pregnancy and can I use while trying to conceive yeah so there's there is there no published data regarding meppel ISM AB and pregnancy and so I would approach it with with great caution there is GlaxoSmithKline does have a pregnancy registry and if you're going to get pregnant and you're either on it or have been on this therapy then I was you know get in touch with this box or switch on report that in terms of what I advocate for my patients because there's so much unknown about this relatively new therapy and we don't have any good pregnancy data and we don't know what any effects are on the fetus let alone on a pregnant mother I would approach use of this therapy with great caution as I would with any drug in anybody who's contemplating pregnancy and I can tell you what I've advocated some of my other patients is I've recommended that they tried to come off of this therapy or at least several months before they contemplate getting pregnant III tend to be very very cautious in this area and you know the last thing I want to do is cause any kind of harm to a pregnant mother or to a child or or potentially impact a pregnancy so I tend to be very very cautious you know and one has to balance if the drug is really doing a great job in controlling the mother's disease then one has to balance the adverse the desire to get pregnant and then figure out the exact timing all complicated issues and again I would discuss this with your physician and with a high-risk OB person thank you last question interesting one how can I be sure Nicola is working for me are there any tests and how often should I be tested yeah so it's a good question I get asked a lot which is you know how do I know if the drug is working and so I try to think back of what was the reason that I put the person on the drug to start with it was because of frequent exacerbations or flares was it because of any ability to taper corticosteroids was it because of ongoing Easterns effect issue inflammation and then I evaluate each of those aspects after usually about three to six months of dosage of value where they're not as effective you can tell when the drug is doing what it's supposed to do just by looking at yes NFL counts looking at blood eosinophils counts they should come down you know certainly less than 100 is oftentimes less than 50 and so you know that the drug is doing what it's supposed to do the question is is how is it benefiting you specifically and your disease that's another good question okay thank you that was very helpful and Kalyn I'll send it back to you perfect thank you and dr. Wexler thank you again for answering all of these questions and taking the time today to present to us so I have quite a quite a few questions but the first that I'd like to ask that there's several kind of pertaining to it is how does the use of methyl is in lab compared to rituximab in eg PA and they're more specifically one that has not brought for a patient that has not run into admission in the past four years which is kind of across the board do you have information on how it compares or is it more patient to patient it was there been no head-to-head studies of vertex um a versus mentalism ABBA in these patients in fact they're you know rituximab there's actually you know they're just case series there have been no head-to-head placebo-controlled studies either you with rituximab so now rituximab was often used in people who have Inca positivity and presence of antibodies and for people with a more yes the philic disorder you know I would certainly think that anti five therapy now it doesn't work in everybody and and people can still relapse and that's because there are many different causes of relapse and disease activity but the short answer to your question is is there's no head-to-head data with regard to anti five versus rituximab that kind of study does need to be done but has not been done a date to date and a note rituximab is not currently approved for EG PA I mean it's used because there have been no medications of proofread GPA and yeah but there is there is a there is a need to do more studies with drugs like rituximab in this entity great thank you this one is about again about metal is mass but to do study show methyl is methyl lithium AB being effective in oral steroids dependent EGP patients not only for the respiratory disease but also any GI involvement yeah so there are benefits seen with regard to relapses overall including asthma relapses and vascular vasculitis as well as a steroid tapering and including for GI related symptoms you know it's if there particularly if there's yes an effect tissue infiltration into the GI tract this drug can be effective there have been other studies looking at yes and flow GI diseases that are ongoing couldn't get used to Villa gastroenteritis eosinophilic esophagitis and those studies need to be a value as well those are not each GPA with GI manifestations those are different entities so yeah so there's a probable role I can't say definitively with regard to GI involvement across the board but there's a probable benefit for methyl ISM have been patients with GI involvement great thank you I'm so now kind of shifting away from methylation labs to other questions just for about eg PA so one is and this this question we actually get quite quite often are there any diet vitamins or lifestyle recommendations as alternative medicines or in addition to the medications that you're taking that you would recommend well I think it's important for everybody to have a healthy lifestyle and to eat a balanced diet and certainly if they're foods that people are intolerant to or that seem to cause problems you know I think it's oh you know but what one's grandmother told them you know eat eat well sleep well exercise all those apply to patients both with GE GPA and without E GPA I don't have any other specific recommendations for people with with a GPA although you know there are some people who have identified specific foods that can exacerbate their underlying yes Mesilla processes and so you know I would be very cautious for instance there have been case series of different vitamins and supplements that can cause eosinophils and could cause problems in people I've had patients who've let you know on 6070 different supplements that sometimes very hard to figure out but you know in the 90s there was this rash of cases of yes miss Aleeah yes an affiliate myalgia syndrome associated with l-tryptophan for instance it tainted l-tryptophan but you know so I would just be cautious I tell people you know do it in terms of vitamins and things like that do you feel what you want to do don't go crazy with it it can be potential side effects from some of the over-the-counter preparations but otherwise just you know eat well sleep well exercise thank you and another question and again this one is a little more not contentious maybe but but it is a subject that comes up quite a bit and again maybe more for a different webinar but the question was about CBD oil so CBD oil has become very popular as an alternative to narcotic pain meds and to help reduce inflammation do you have any thoughts hmm yeah okay I don't have any information about CBD oil I generally caution people about putting things in their body or on their body that that you know could potentially cause more problems and and you know if it seems to work for you it isn't causing problems and great go ahead but I don't endorsement for most people so do you have so kind of for both of those questions because they are very they're just maybe hotly debated is a better way to phrase that but you have a do you have any resources or suggestions for a good for good information that is neutral kind of all the way around both our patients could visit or look at that may be helpful giving like my no III would try to look at this scientific literature and look for objective peer-reviewed data I tend to be very data-driven and a lot of times you know there's a lot of for supplements and over-the-counter things there's a lot of marketing that isn't necessarily data-driven so just be very cautious because a lot of the things that you can buy a lot of these kinds of supplements doors and vitamin stores they're expensive but not effective and can be potentially harmful so just be very cautious great thank you so much and so I think we're nearing the top of the hour Joyce do we want to take a couple more questions or would we like to wrap up and and then provide the remaining questions to dr. Wexler to potentially answer at a later time so a couple questions let me take a couple more questions and then wrap things up okay so one of the questions has come in is about peripheral neuropathy is there any weak ooh heal it or alleviate some of the symptoms or the pain that's caused peripheral neuropathy I'd say is one of the biggest challenges in the management of EGP a because the pain is often persistent there can be regrowth of some of the nerves but it but any long-term benefits oftentimes there's damage that's done and the Daren's oftentimes is not or is not reversible there can be a reversible component but it can take a lot of time you know there's a lot of people who see pain specialists for management I think one of the key things in the management of EGP a people who have neuropathy issues to prevent further neuropathy from occurring and and you can do that using some of the medications that we've discussed and some of the steroids but in terms of people who have an active neuropathy not a lot has been shown to verses but goals to try to improve it is best when one can okay thanks the other question that was submitted to me was on fatigue patients are not sure is the fatigue caused by the disease by the medications a combination and you have what do you suggest for your patients yeah all of the above you know the fatigue can be from the disease itself and the inflammation that's ongoing it can be from and I think this is in most cases probably from the corticosteroids that are used to treat the disease and tapering of corticosteroids is associated with it adrenal insufficiency and so lack of adrenal disease a good adrenal workup is what I do and I work with my endocrinologist to try to get people on an optimal dose of corticosteroids okay so that was all the questions I have Kalyn Edie do you have any other quick well we'll call it will stop the questions now since we're coming up on the end of the hour again dr. Wexler I just wanted to say thank you very much for giving the presentation today and spending your time with us we greatly appreciate your your support and all your research on the disease and helping improve patients lives so thank you very much many of you have submitted questions so we'll bundle them together and we'll send them off to dr. Wexler and if he has time maybe he can answer some more of them we would have recorded this webinar and so after we edit it we will be putting it in the library on the website for to watch or if you want to share it with one of your family members or somebody who's missed the webinar today you know please do that yeah or if you have a hard time falling asleep it's probably great and my final thing is I just wanted to wish everyone a very happy holiday season we are in our VF annual appeal of join our journey campaign today is giving Tuesday we are asking people to support the the after that giving Tuesday either through the website or through social media and we want to thank everyone who's already donated we have a ten thousand dollar matching gift today so every donation you make will be matched up to ten thousand dollars so we're very excited about that but I just wanted to thank everyone again for attending and have a great day"
