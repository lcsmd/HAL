        "transcript": "we all know that prompt engineering has exploded in the last year and whether it's here to stay or not that's more of a question of the future but what's important now is to get on top of these skills and learn how to actually write prompts but this isn't just guesswork in fact in a paper by Vanderbilt University titled a prompt pattern catalog to enhance prompt engineering with chbt researchers and Scholars deep in the field of AI and llms wrote out a comprehensive overview of various prompt patterns that can be used to enhance interaction with conversational large language models like chat gbt so as mentioned earlier the importance of knowing these prompt patterns is to equip you with the ability to enhance the Effectiveness and efficiency of your interactions with tools like chat PT so in this video I'll go through 11 prompt patterns for advanced chat PT skills as noted from researchers but before I dive deep into these patterns don't forget to like the video so you can level yourself up and subscribe to this channel if you want to continue to learn the building blocks for this age of AI so the following prompt patterns that are to be mentioned can be be categorized into six individual categories so it gives you an idea of their particular use there is input semantics output customization error identification prompt Improvement interaction and context control so these are the key categories for these different prompts the first prompt pattern on this list meta language creation is a pattern that helps to communicate more efficiently with the llm by cre a set of terms beforehand since writing prompts involves being clear with what you want sometimes standard language may be insufficient to describe complex instructions that you may need in fact just because we know how to speak doesn't necessarily mean we speak well all you really need here is a set of terms or codes that are relevant to your input think of it as creating like an index it's like building up your own glossery into the prompt so that instead of having to use that specific word you can refer to a specific term for the AI to refer to an example prompt to this could be moving forward A1 will refer to our primary audience segment and B2 will refer to our secondary design theme the next pattern is output automator this pattern is all about generating scripts within the AI to automate specific tasks this is a great way to reduce the manual effort to write out everything step by step and is a great way to save time all you really need here is to feed the llm a detailed step-by-step process or instruction on what it needs to create so an example prompt could be create a workflow script for scheduling and Publishing our weekly social media content provide each date in which the content will be published and at what time is best make sure to put all information into a table so in this case the fact that I'm asking it to create a workflow script as well as putting it in information into a table is controlling the way that is putting the output the next pattern is the Persona pattern llms like Chachi don't need to solely be one way remember these are tools to have as conversation with not just instructional order this means you can assign it a specific type of persona to influence the type of output it will generate this pattern is useful when outputs need to be tailored to specific viewpoints or expertise it's also very handy when you want to tailor the communication style or content to fit a specific role or character so for example an example prompt could be act as a fitness coach and provide workout advice tailored for [Music] beginners the next pattern on this list is visualization generator this is when you want to get the text to describe something visually it is useful for people who want to find the right words that can help in generating visual formats it's made particularly useful for developers or marketers that are speaking with designers on a frequent basis the promp pattern assists in the initial stages of design by providing descriptive visual ideas for for example describe a minimalist and eco-friendly packaging design for our organic skincare product be as descriptive and clear as possible so it's easy for anyone to understand one way to take this further if you have CBT plus is to Simply ask it to generate an image of an item which will then pull from Dolly 3 to generate a visualization itself so an example could be based on the description you provided about the packaging design for an organic skincare product generate an image that fits the description to give me some ideas the next pattern is then called recipe pattern this next pattern is great for providing step-by-step guidelines that can help the reader follow through think of it as a way to generate a walkthrough response or any other procedural task all you need here is to ensure you're feeding in a desired outcome of a given task so an example could be give me a recipe for conducting a successful focus group for our new product plan and then there's the template pattern this is a pattern that is a structured approach that utilizes predefined formats for generating responses or content this can be particularly useful in situations where consistency standardization and adherence to specific formats are crucial especially in an organization this is especially important as I mentioned in professional settings where you need to have consistency and communication or documentation an example could be first provide a template for a press release announcing a new product launch then create a product FAQ based on our template addressing common queries about our latest product launch and then there's fact checklist this prompt pattern focus on identifying assertions or claims within a generated output that require verification we all know that llms aren't perfect so this pattern is super valuable and ensuring the accuracy and reliability of information which is particularly crucial in professional and academic contexts you do this by instructing the llm to follow up its responses with the list of claims or statements that are either Central to the response or could be contentious or perhaps uncertain this pattern is not about the llm factchecking the content itself but rather about identifying parts of its output that the user or yourself should be should verify independently so this pattern can significantly help in mitigating the spread of misinformation and ensuring that AI tools like chpt are used in a more informed manner an example prompt could be provide a list of key data points in our market analysis report that should be verified for accuracy and current [Music] relevance then the next is the reflection pattern this pattern is aim to get the llm to evaluate and comment on its own responses it's a way to provide insights into why a response came out a certain way what factors it considered and how it interpreted the prompt essentially it's getting to understand the reasoning behind the output you might prompt it to to explain the rationale behind its conclusions the sources of information it relied upon or to discuss possible uncertainties in its response so an example prompt could be explain the reasoning behind your color and layout choices for the website redesign aimed at increasing user engagement take note of the words explain the reasoning then there's the question refinement pattern this next pattern is particularly effective in refining and clarifying any questions you send over to the llm ensuring that your resp responses are more targeted and relevant essentially the purpose is to enhance the specificity and Clarity of questions asked by the user itself so this pattern instructs the llm to kind of suggest improved versions of the user's original questions leading to a more accurate and useful answers you first provide a broad or initial question and then you instruct the model to refine or rephrase this question in a way that would likely yield more detailed or comprehensive answers so an example could be how can I make my website better refine this question to focus specifically on improving user design for increased user engagement so take note of the words refine this question because you're asking it to really shift the way that you're asking the question [Music] itself and then there's alternative approaches pattern this promp pattern is particularly for exploring various methods or strategies to address specific problem or a task so this pattern broadens the scope of responses providing multiple perspectives this approach is really great for helping avoid cognitive biases by not fixating on a single solution it's really beneficial when the first or most obvious solution is not really the best or you don't really know if it is the best so what you do is present a task or problem to the llm and explicitly ask it to generate multiple different approaches or Solutions so an example prompt could be provide alternative strategies for the promotion of our new eco-friendly product online including potential reach and customer engagement strategies so take note here here provide alternative a etc etc and then there's a refusal breaker pattern the main goal of this refusal breaker pattern is to rephrase a query that you put gave to the llm and just in case it doesn't really want to answer you because it breaks ethical guidelines or the models capabilities sometimes you need to kind of reward the statement or reward the input so that it can kind of give you the output in the right way so this usually involves asking how to change the phrasing providing additional context or Shifting the focus of the query so for example let's say chpt refuses to provide you an output due to the ethical guidelines you can give an example prompt like give me some alternative ways to ask the question without breaking guidelines what are some general best practices in creating a business strategy that focuses on Innovation and market research so take note give me some alternative ways to ask the question right so perhaps your input was not fitting the guidelines so you need to ask it to to give you the direction of how you can reord it and then there's the flipped interaction pattern as the name implies this pattern reverses the standard Dynamic of user model interaction where instead of the user primarily asking questions the llm takes more of a proactive role in driving the conversation so this is where CPT will ask you a series of questions to gather information clarify needs and it's particularly effective when you might not have all the necessary information or clarity about what needs to be asked so all you need to do is prompt the llm to initiate a series of questions based on a given topic you respond to these questions providing it more information and then needs to generate more targeted outputs so an example prompt could be ask me a series of questions to help identify key trends in consumer behavior for eco-friendly products so take note here ask me a series of questions so now the llm or tgpt in this case knows to ask you the question and then you will do the answering which will then feed it more information and then there's the gam playay pattern this pattern transforms dialogue into more of like a game likee format so the central aim of this pattern is to gamify the interaction making it more of a back and forth like a quiz or a problem solving activity this can be particularly useful for students who want to leverage chb to learn more about a specific subject so an example prompt could be cre Create a quiz game about Basic Marketing principles providing feedback and explanations after each answer so take note here Create a quiz right and then the words providing feedback and explanations after each answer so that way you're actually learning rather than just instructing it to do something and then there's the infinite generation pattern this prompt is designed to create a continuous stream of content or responses so this pattern is really useful in scenarios where you want an ongoing generation of ideas and information despite the different prompts you're giving it you initially set up a context or theme and then prompt the llm to keep generating content related to that theme making sure that the llm continues to build upon the initial input an example prompt could be each time new information is fed to you keep generating unique social media posts ideas for our eco-friendly product line focusing on a different product feature each time so take note here the words each time new information is fed to you keep generating all right so these words will tell the llm okay I need to keep generating ideas about something about a specific thing each time I put out a new answer and then the last prompt is called the context manager prompt so this is all about defining maintaining and manipulating the context of conversation this pattern is really valuable in scenarios where the continuity of context plays a significant role in the relevance of the response so this is to ensure that chat jbt or the llm recognizes and retains the context throughout an interaction from the background of the topic preferences or any relevant information after all you don't want to be conversing with an llm that is always forgetting previous context the whole point is to remember previous context so that it can build upon that so you need to explicitly State the context at the beginning or during the conversation and instruct the llm to keep that context in mind in its responses so an example prompt could be in the context of targeting Millennial demographic suggest marketing strategies keep this focused throughout our conversation adjusting your suggestions as I provide more details about the preferences so take note here in the context of and then you put in the context and then and then thereafter you write keep this Focus throughout our conversation so you need to really make sure that the chat GPT or llm is aware that it needs to remember this context for the rest of the conversation so there you have have it 11 prompt patterns that help you advance yourself and your knowledge on using chat jpt or perhaps other llms all of these are quite useful as it helps improve efficiency of the output but also it helps you learn in a more interactive and understandable way as well you can also use these PRS mentioned to improve the accuracy precision and just contextual understanding remember chpt is not an instructional tool it is a conversational tool but if you found this video helpful don't forget to like the video and I'd really love it if you could subscribe to this channel if you want more content on tools tips and tricks that help you navigate this new digital ocean of [Music] AI"
