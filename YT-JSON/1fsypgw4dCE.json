        "transcript": "I've just had possibly my biggest AI breakthrough yet I'm really excited to share this new method with you what we're going to be doing today is creating a custom GPT for any process in this way we're going to be turning chat GPT into some very powerful automation software this will be especially useful for entrepreneurs and marketers who are looking to save time save money iterate and improve faster and gain efficiencies and they even say that someday these gpts will be able to generate revenue for you so I think this is a skill that's going to be very valuable going forward if you've struggled to create a custom GPT that's useful then you're not alone I have experimented with them quite a bit and while they are a lot of fun they often fall down when you're trying to put them in production and really get some good use out of them for me I feel like this was the case because I was often going too broad with what I was creating but I've learned if we can focus them into a stepbystep process they can become incredibly useful if you think about it it's a lot like designing a video game if you're creating creating a video game where you can go in any direction it's very difficult but if you're creating a video game where you simply go from one level to the next it's much easier and that's exactly what we're going to be doing today I want to show you how to create a custom GPT that builds PPC campaigns those are paperclick campaigns for both Google and Facebook following a step-by-step process if you're new to the Blazing zebra Channel I'd like to welcome you and thank you for joining me on my mission of helping marketers and entrepreneurs around the world my goal is to provide you with practical AI skills to drive profitability and business success if you're enjoying these videos please consider supporting me on patreon there's a link in the description to that it includes tons of extra resources cheat sheets to my videos and a whole lot more so there's three steps to getting this done the first one is creating a prompt sequence that includes all of the prompts you need to get whatever process you're trying to automate done then we're going to convert that prompt sequence into a set of GPT instructions that can be used inside of a custom GPT make sure to stick around to the end of the video I'll show you how to automate this step finally we will be testing and deploying this GPT the first step is to create a promp sequence and these are two prompts that have helped me create these sequences the first one please list the detailed steps for whatever process you're trying to automate and then following that up with asking the large language model in this case chat GPT to create promps for each one of those steps and here's what that looks like for today's example I went through those I edited them a little bit and I came up with this list of prompts that has been very helpful for creating PPC campaigns and next we need to convert that prompt sequence into the instructions that we're going to be using in the custom GPT some helpful ways to think about that are to just get a feel for the main ideas make sure they're going in the proper order and then adding these check-in points or these feedback loops I'm going to show you what that looks like here in a second that uh prompts the custom GPT to ask the user hey am I going in the right direction which of these do you like Etc and build a little bit of that back and forth as the custom GPT is completing whatever uh task you're looking for it to complete so once again here's the prompt sequence for creating the PPC campaign and you can see here how I have converted this into these uh custom instructions that we can use with these gpts so it basically starts with you'll take the copy that the user uploads and perform the following steps on it step one come up with four campaign ideas return these to the user and ask which of these they'd like to proceed with for the next step which is creating the customer profile and then it just works through all of these and after each step asking the user hey am I going in the right direction which of these do you like the most Etc so you can begin to think through it and sometimes as you're testing you can build out these little interaction points so it's taking those prompts putting them in a sequential order that makes sense and adding these little tags in between that discuss how the custom GPT should return the specific information and how it should interact with the user going into the next step I'll include all of this in the cheat sheet there's a link to that in the description for my patreon supporters now that we have these instructions we can just pop this in and very easily create our custom GPT so I'm going to copy and paste these we'll hop into chat GPT for for this is the plus paid version click explore click up here create a GPT we're going to skip this Builder this create tab um I have another video All About mistakes and I think this is what leads most people to many frustrations is this create tab we're going straight to the configure tab we're going to paste these instructions in here just as is we're going to name this PPC campaign Creator we going to add a quick description this description doesn't have anything to do with the way the custom GPT operates but it is a good way to tell the user how to begin and that is it that is all we need so now we can move on to the step three which is testing and iterating so this is a landing page for an AI coaching program that I'm working on I'm just going to copy everything select everything copy it and I'm going to paste it back here in our PPC campaign Creator just as is you can see very messy and you can see here it's generated this copy here these are the four different campaign ideas I think these are pretty solid now it asks which of these campaign ideas would you like to proceed with creating an ideal customer profile that's the next step in the process I'm going to say all of these are good and now it's generating some icps ideal customer profiles for these different campaigns what's beautiful here is if you run into problems you can just edit your instructions right here I think that there is some real genius to the way that this is laid out so you don't need to jump back and forth between uh updating your instructions and testing now it says would you like to proceed with step three yes I would this is giving us all the demographics behaviors interests that can be very useful for targeting awesome these look good obviously you can tweak these you can dive into one in particular you can um tell it that it needs to be adjusted in a certain way based on your knowledge but let's just proceed with step four looking at keywords and here it is generating key different key wordss for these different campaigns you can then drop these into whatever tool that you use if you're a marketer you're probably familiar with sem rush or ah refs so you can double check some of these but these will for sure get you started in the right direction as far as keyword ideas go now it ask would you like to generate the Google ads which was our step five and here are the Google ads based on the character counts it looks like like it's doing a good job on the character count sometimes it struggles with that but those are all in the instructions the context window has gotten much larger recently which is really amazing would you like it to continue with the rest of the Google ads remaining two campaigns that's nice I like that it stopped there and it didn't try to just create bad or truncated campaigns um I'm going to just say let's Skip To The Next Step step six is to create the Facebook ads which have slightly different uh character counts and formats for the copy obviously you're going to need to find some images for these as well I would suggest using mid Journey for that as I've had the best luck with that or you know looking at different stock images as well but this is not necessarily a video about PPC campaign creation it's more about this process of uh building these custom gpts now we're watching it go into step seven generating the landing page pretty decent landing page definitely a few things that I would tweak here and I might do that actually in the instructions themselves and this is the final step here creating this video script that can be used in the ads or potentially on the landing page itself and this gives full directions the copy as well as ideas on the visuals here it asks us would you like any adjustments or is there anything else you need so now we've walked through that complete stepbystep process and I'll link to that custom GPT in the description but these are the steps we went through prompt sequence created the instructions we've tested it and to deploy it you can just uh share that publicly you can share it with people uh only people that have the link or you can keep it to yourself so I think publicly sharing it means anyone can find it only people with the link uh is only people that you share it with and then obviously you can keep it private just to yourself if you would like to do that when you are sharing it um one other thing I'd like to show you is that I've actually created a custom GPT to convert The Prompt sequence into these GPT instructions so I'll put a link to this one in the description as well but with this one you can just take your prompt sequence and it will convert it into the instructions let me show you how this works here's the prompt sequence that we just went through again this is not the instructions this is just the raw prompt sequence I'm going to copy this I'm going to drop this into my prompt sequence GPT instructions generator and it Returns the very instructions that we just went through so if you have some great prompt sequences that are working for you feel free to use this instructions generator which will turn those into a custom bot for you all right thanks for watching and again thanks for joining me on my mission of helping marketers and entrepreneurs around the world I love providing comprehensive AI skills with the goal of enhancing your profitability and your business success if you got something
