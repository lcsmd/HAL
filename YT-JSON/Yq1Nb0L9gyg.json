        "transcript": "is to the lack of access this guy is a walking stand-in and he can't even stand let's say today he was standing upright on the picket line with the Auto Workers right you guys the UAW you saved the automobile industry back in 2014. made a lot of sacrifices gave up a lot and the companies were in trouble but now they're doing incredibly well and guess what you should be doing incredibly well too and I put together some of Trump's latest cognitive Beauties from the last 10 days he said you need an ID to buy bread I still don't need television one of these characters there shouldn't be voter ID now you have voter ID to buy a loaf of bread you have you have ID to buy a loaf of bread you have all right let me paint you a little picture here so you've been in a coma the last few years you come out of it to find those two candidates for president just three years separating them in age incumbent is on the front lines with union workers making history as the first modern day president to do so the other stood in front of a crowd of people and said that whale deaths are being doctored and that Jeb Bush is responsible for the Iraq War it's less than four months before the season such we started in Iowa we go to New Hampshire we come down here you know the beauty was when I came here everyone thought Bush was going to win and then they took a poll and they found out Trump was up by about 50 points everyone said what's going on right here they thought Bush because Bush supposedly was a military person great you know what he was a Miller he got us into the uh he got us into the Middle East how did that work out right but they all thought that uh Bush might win Jeb remember Jeb he used he used the word Jeb he didn't use the word Bush I said you mean he's ashamed of the last name and then they immediately started using the name Bush never forget it but we came here which of the two do you think is considered too old this conversation took place on Fox News The Five this week with The Usual Suspects impersonating their Fearless cult leader by yelling false at ease until one of them sticks this is to the lack of access this guy is a walking stand-in and he can't even stand and he's about this close to falling down again and that's how scared they are I would just say today he was standing upright on the picket line with the Auto Workers right and tomorrow Trump will be showing showing up at a non-union plan in Michigan he was not invited by the union to come and speak yeah yeah okay well I bought bread with an ID the other day yes Jesse wattles a resident proponent of Biden conspiracy theories surrounding his health was on the offense in favor of trump the resident liberal voice Jessica tala was on hand with receipts to remind him that well mate if you're going to play that card what about your own candidate based on what other world leaders and people in other countries think of America but you said okay you don't need to watch him let's just hear what comes out of his mouth and I put together some of Trump's latest cognitive Beauties from the last 10 days he said you need an ID to buy bread has anyone shown ID to get Wonder Bread lately he said that he ran against Obama in 2016. have weaponized law enforcement to arrest their leading political a lot including Obama I'll tell you what you take a look at Obama and take a look at some of the things that he's done this is the same thing the country is very divided and we did with Obama we won an election that everyone said couldn't be won he ran against Hillary Clinton he warned that Biden will get us into World War II which I'm pretty sure we already fought and won and yesterday he confused Jeb Bush and George W bush and said that Jeb got us involved in the Middle East and then of course there are his authoritarian posts on true social calling for the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to be executed and saying that is going to investigate media companies that he does not like can you imagine if Biden said you know what I'm going to look into that Fox News this they don't seem to like me over there this may be the choice that people have and this is the thing most of the people who are making the case that Biden's age is a deterring fact though in 2024. I'll just seemingly ignoring the fact that their own candidate a man who's quite literally been yelling into the sky about an election that he thinks he still won despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary what do you say to that female independent Suburban voter who feels that way to win her back first of all I won in 2020 by a lot okay let's get that straight I won in 2020. you know and if you look at all of the tapes if you look at everything that you want to look at you take a look at truth to vote where they have people stuffing the ballot boxes on tapes or Mr President okay wait a minute let's go to recent FBI Twitter let's go to recent the 51 agents all corrupt stuff understand about that collection but that's cheating when they lost the 2020 election uh Brad uh you take a look at all of the stuff ballots you take a look at all of the things including things like the 51 intelligence agents there were recounts in all of the Swing states there was not significant ones we're trying to get recounts real recounts numbers widespread corruption there was not a sense of that there were lawsuits more than 50 of them by your lawyers some in front of judges judges that you appointed look at Wisconsin it's almost melting before our eye from claiming that he beat Barack Obama in 2016 to win the presidency that Jeb Bush the only Bush whose fingerprints aren't all over Iraq was responsible for leading America into that war and that the most pressing issue today for voters is windmill to whale death ratio I think U.S are being struck by lightning than hitting a whale with your boat there has only been listen to this one such whale killed off the coast of South Carolina in the last 50 years but on the other hand their windmills are causing whales to die and numbers never seen before nobody does anything about that they're washing up a show I saw it this weekend three of them came up they wouldn't you wouldn't see it once a year now they're coming up on a weekly basis but don't worry those are just a few and msnbc's Mary Hassan was on hand who put together a montage of Trump's best bits but you said okay you don't need to watch him let's just hear what comes out of his mouth I'm on a report I wish covered the oranges how it started in the failing New York Times by Anonymous really an anonymous gutless coward they sacrifice every day for the furniture future of their children Tim apples Mike pounds I know words I had the best words your semites your seminites nambia Thailand [Music] you have voter ID to buy a loaf of bread the Democrats oh there was a mosquito I don't want mosquitoes around me I'm a very stable genius I know the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute one minute and is there a way we can do something like that by injection I tested positively toward negative right [Music] [Applause] [Music] people are flushing toilets 10 times 15 times as opposed to once thanks right showers and what goes with the sink in a shower [Applause] ten times right 10 times you want to wash your hands you turn on the seat the water comes up no get those lights off off you have a shower it's no good for me remember the dishwasher you can press it boom it'd be like an explosion one of the wettest we've ever seen from the standpoint of water [Applause] and the worst president in the history of our country who is cognitively impaired in no condition to lead and is now in charge of dealing with Russia and possible nuclear war just think of it we would be in World War II very quickly God bless the United States [Music] hey might as mighty love this report continue the conversation by following us on Instagram at Midas Touch to keep up with the most important news of the day what are you waiting for follow us now makeup"
