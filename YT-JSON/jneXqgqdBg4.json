        "transcript": "the rise of AI agents is very close here is how to prepare so AI agents are rising up agents represent the next evolution of automations first we had machines like in agriculture then we had robots in factories then came computers and now are coming AI agents now agents are essentially llms they're able to interact with digital environments they can do things with agents Comes potential to automate literally anything with just an API and that revolutionizes entire Industries here's the dream situation you are one of the first people in your industry to utilize agents and get ahead agents start taking over the industry and you are one of the few people one of the only people who can build them true passive income might be possible for the first time you know passive income is largely a scam because you have to work to build it but with agents you might be able to build something that works for you which has huge implications now ai agents the most affective ones will actually be teams or swarms it won't be individual agents so agent swarms deploy an arbitrary number of Agents it could be 5 10 20 and you can think of it as similar to Nanobots you know you have teams swarms of agents that are highly specialized every agent doing one thing and together they are more powerful than by themselves we are just months away from creating fully autonomous agent swarms that are self-organizing and self-improving and the amount of people that truly understand this is so few when building agents use the divide and conquer approach to problem solve and specialize you know divide the tasks into subtasks and Target each task with a single agent here are what llms you should use Hau should replace gbt 3.5 if you're using gbt 3.5 just use Hau from CLA free because it's cheaper and it's a lot smarter Sonet is the middle model I mean it's kind of in a weird space but Opus is the best model from C it's very expensive but it's better than gp4 in some aspects overall it's worse but in create creative writing it's better mistol has very interesting models mixol 87b is a mixure of experts models that's open source and you can run it locally but your PC needs to be pretty good Mr Large is their best model but it's close sour right now so you can only run it through API really open AI of course 3.5 honestly doesn't really have a viable use case anymore gbd 4 Turbo is state-ofthe-art model still best available right now but it's on the expensive side not as expensive as Opus though now this is a super important concept to realize when building teams of Agents you need a chat manager or a team leader or a CEO doesn't matter what you call it right every team needs a main agent that overlooks the whole group well you technically don't need it but the the performance of your agents will be greatly improved if you have a CEO or a manager you can think of it as a CEO in a normal company the leader should be the smartest of the group to manage everyone so make sure to use state-of-the-art model like Claud fre Opus or gbd4 tribo for the leader for the manager agent now here are some common mistakes I see people make when building agents building and testing with state-of thee a models which gets real expensive real quick instead use cheap models to test it out and then when you're finished switch to an expensive ones to get the best results now occasionally when you're building you should you know do a switch maybe every 10th time like 10% of the time you should test with expensive models and 90% just run with cheap ones otherwise it will cost a lot of money now AGI agents will actually overtake AI agents and this is thinking into the future there is a rapid shift in discussion about AGI and super intelligence that's happening right now Tech leaders are openly talking about AGI which makes it mainstream you know average people are still clueless obviously but a lot more people are talking about AGI because of you know Sam timman Elon Musk and these influential leaders Andre karafi which is one of the greatest AI researchers of all time thinks that AI agents is how AGI will take its form rather than a single super intelligent entity now here are some real world applications of AI agents content creation gener generating blog post and social media content from video R scripts can save you hours streamlining tasks and processes across different Industries you don't always have to invent something new you can just optimize current processes and save time potential to automate repetitive tasks and contribute to scientific innovation it will not replace full jobs this is what people understand before agents replace full jobs they'll replace specific tasks so like a 10% of your workflow a certain task that takes 5 minutes that is what agents are perfect for something specific something clear now here are some successful agent implementations cold calling like this this is huge I mean if you have a company that does c calling look into a agents because and later in this module I'll show you how to implement the voice which you know is how you do the calls and this can like massively increase the amount of volume and sales for your company with very little effort I mean you just have to set it up creating AI videos you can create shorts or Tik toks at a scale unprecedented before I mean I've seen people create thousands of shorts in 15 minutes it's insane automatic email response pipelines everyone gets emails that are not worthy of a serious response you can have an agent monitoring an inbox and responding automatically now when thinking of AI agents think of your pain points your problems what are five tasks that you have to do every day five small tasks that could be automated with an agent now rate the comp tasks from 1 to 10 on how complex they are could you use agents to or those tasks well start with the ones that are number one the simplest number two you know the most annoying if they happen every five minutes you should automate that and number three the least complex you know the easiest to automate and if you do these lists and you see something is you know top of Multiple List start with that start with something that is simple that happens often and that is uh easy to automate so that's perfect use cases for AI agents solve your own pain points now having multiple agents is key to getting great results the more specifically an agent is tailored to a tasks the more effective will it will be break down large tasks into smaller ones for maximum efficiency and here's the trick break down the small tasks into mini tasks now this is like where you get really really great agent teams it doesn't cost you any extra money to build more agents do it once and you will be set forever the illusion is that people think that less agents will save their money but you get mediocre performance so you have to run it more times so you actually save money by having more agents in your workflow now the rise of no code user interfaces is here so even if you're so if you are not a programmer pay attention there is an emergence of platform like orogen Studio by the way in the next module I'll bu I'll be building self-improving AI agents with autogen so if you're interested in that make sure to join my community link in the description enabling users to build and deploy a agents without extensive programming is huge this will unlock millions of people to build their own agents and they don't have to do any programming it's democratizing AI agents and empowering more people to create their own swarms which will help us even those who can do some programming to get ahead faster because we can use those um you know teams of agents that build someone else who otherwise could not even get started multi-agent systems really are the future and I'm super confident in this so what this means is AI agents with specialized roles working together on complex task again the more specialized the better customizable workflows and interactions between agents are key this is where the real value is created the systems and workflows you come up with so don't build agents that are just jack of all trades and master of none Focus an agent on a single trade and make it Master it prompt engineer it you know as as best as you can now learn from flow engineering because this is the next evolution of prompt engineering instead of you know doing individual PR engineering which is good and still useful started designing agent communication flows so you know how agent one communicates agent three and then calls agent five back those are flows those charts diagrams designing the correct structure and systems can be Priceless I mean if you work for a big company or if you run a big company those can be seven to eight figure problems if you desire a correct AI agent system maximize Effectiveness through hierarchical or noral organization so sometimes you have a you know like a CEO and then you have some managers and then you have like agents that do the tasks well sometimes you can have just a team of agents that are all on the same level and get better results that way this is why experiment in is key self-improving agents this this is like the Talk of the Town this is the future and that's why I'm focusing the entire module number four the next module after this on that building self-improving agents with orogen a agents that can iteratively refine their workflows and build tools so what does it mean self-improving well it's not you know like the llm is getting better but actually it's the agent developing some sort of a system some sort of a memory based on the task is performing and then the this is the key part building tools so connecting new apis and having M more tools for itself once you do this your team of Agents becomes like 10 times more useful if it can look up an API and connect a new tool like that is huge that is self-improvement Agent Frameworks are now enabling the creation of self-improving Agents with architect reviewer and Optimizer roles now this is just one example you can can obviously structure it however you want continuous Improvement based on memory longer context windows and more tools so all of these thingss improve the AI agents and none of them are you know better llms which is what most people think of self-improving Open Source models and external apis are huge powering your agents with local open source models gives you privacy and flexibility and if you if the model is unrestricted you can ask anything you can leverage fine-tuned open source models for specific tasks within your team so there are you know like instruct or fine-tuned for function calling there are so many open source models it's it's kind of crazy man just go on hugging face and look through the models and adding external tools via API is the way to build great agents it's much more important than prompting and everybody's focused on promt engineering but giving your agents more tools more apis to access like imagine an agent that's completely offline and then an agent that can browse Google browse YouTube do complex math via Wolfram like the difference is night and day function calling and small models Now function calling isn't just for apis it's also for your own custom functions so if you do a bit of programming you have an advantage example you can either use the Lang chain Reddit tool which is decent or you can code your own in like 40 lines of code h t L human in the loop designing agents with human in the loop loop can have very surprising results much better than people realize I.E when an agent gets stuck or has to make an important decision it asks you the human to get it unstuck or to make the decision now in the long run the goal is to minimize human intervention but right now because AI agents are not perfect it's still quite viable strategy now the a framework is very interesting it's revolutionary open source project aiming to create fully autonomous AI agents it prioritizes cognition and thinking before taking action which is system two thinking meaning right now llms are doing system one just instantly generate tokens Ace framework aims to have them reason do some thinking before taking any action just like a human does it utilizes a layered architecture with each layer serving a specific purpose like setting goals planning executing taxs so on the the H framework is also very promising it's similar to crew AI but more complex with focus on autonomous behavior of Agents so if you know cre AI if you watch the first two modules you know what I'm talking about by the way definitely watch module number two I built a simple agent with crei anybody can do it U the H framework utilizes a hierarchical system of air agents so as before I said hierarchical and no hierarchical this one is hierarchical meaning there is one C like there is a CEO you know there are structures there are levels hierarchy you know what hierarchy is hopefully and it's more efficient unlike a more flat structure like crei where everybody's on the same level it's not used today but it has huge potential in the future to create more effective agent workflows so if you're a programmer if you develop a tool that uses the Haas framework it could be absolutely huge and here is a better um you know oversight visualization as you can see there is supreme oversight board or the CEO which creates smaller agents and then they delegate subtasks and the more granular you can go the better the performance of your agent team building multimodal AI agents is also super interesting using apis like gp4 Vision to create agents that can process understand visual information will be like very popular this year and we are already starting to see some promising projects so combining llms with vision and audio will result in Far More capable agents because agents that can only do text and don't have any ability ability to see or hear or speak are not really that strong I mean you can think about a person that's both blind and deaf huge disadvantage right now projects like web Boyer are today showing huge promise there will be link below the module if you are in my community if not then I would recommend you join it but in in the below the modules I always include a bunch of useful resources relevant to that specific module so I'll link the full web Voyager demo and how to build it below using Lang chain you can also give your a agents a voice there are tools for adding voice capabilities such as 11 labs open AI whisper or needs AI also VAP is a new AI tool it's a native tool for AI agents that can um you know you can build and depl employ voice bots in minutes rather than months and that's because everything is done through V you don't have to do any coding you don't have to you know integrate API from 11 apps so check definitely check vapy out if you want to build agents with a voice now here is what you need to know about hardware and how to deploy your agent there there are many deployment options I mean you can do local you can do Cloud you can do Docker now for cloud computing which is what you'll mostly use because you know you'll but running it locally is requires very good computers so you can do Azure from Microsoft AWS from Amazon GCB from Google many options right so if you are using apis if you are not running your models locally you actually can do everything from your PC as long as it turned on because the code is running but it's pinging the API so the llm is running on the cloud and you know you're just executing a short Python program so even if you have a lowbudget notebook you're fine orogen studio now this is the framework that I'll be using in module number four to build uh the self-improving AI agent so pay attention this is right now the most popular AI agent framework it's a no code UI from Microsoft meaning you just set it up and then you don't have to do any programming and it enables rapid proing of multi-agent applications without writing any code it provides an intuitive user interface that creates agents with skills and capab ities and it's very easy to orchestrate them and create very Advanced workflows that you can't really do with other Frameworks and compared to other Frameworks is like really the organizing the agents and like building the systems this is where Oren excels at and also within Oren there are two workflow types the first one is called two agents and the second one is called group chat two agents is where a user proxy agent interfaces with an assist an agent and group chat is for multi-agent collaboration you know there is not just two agents there is way you can have as many as you want developers can now declaratively specify agent properties skills and interactions patterns for each workflow using orogen this wasn't really possible just three or four months ago when Oren was still in the works so like the progress on AI agents is so fast now you have a choice between uh the two agent for like simple Q&A or the group chat for multi-step problems that require more agents now Gro the chip allows you to build world's fastest a agents which honestly I might make an entire video on this so if you're interested in that and if you want me to add this to the course then let me know by the way if you know if you're in the community you'll get first access now Gro has developed a new type of Chip it's not a GPU it's an lpu language processing unit it is designed specifically for Ultra fast air inference and if you use Gro you know that it's like 15 times faster than CH gbd and it's that's insane man now Gro offers Gro cloud with which provides API access to popular llms like llama and mistal so they don't create their own llms they're offering um open source ones like llama 2 or mixol by the way Gro and Gro are two different things the one ending with Q is the new AI chip and the one aing with K is Elon musk's large language model now here is how the future of work might look like humans will be leaders of agent teams and everyone will become a manager everyone will become a CEO there won't be any laborious and boric tasks that you will be doing personally so you won't be wasting any potential you'll just dedicate your team of 10 agents to do it there will be work speeds that today are completely unheard of like imagine if you could achieve in one day what right now you can achieve in a month that will be possible in the next 6 to 12 months man what what a time to be Al here's the future of AI agents don't sleep on them they are going to affect your life in 2024 AI agents are going to enter the market and it will be a revolution right now they are still kind of underground you know only people like me and you who are in the AI space are talking about them in 2024 the average Joe you know your Barber people that shouldn't be talking about them normally will and it will start a massive explosion in popularity so why not be one of the first to act instead of like most people will miss out this is literally once in a lifetime opportunity because once the genie out of the is out of the bottle there is no coming back and right now is the best time to start because as more and more people realize the of AI agents the competition will become massive so if you are interested in building AI agents and you want to start somewhere then make sure to check out the first link in description is the community and inside you will get access to the course on how to build and deploy AI agents which I've made so simple that literally anybody can do it even if you're not a programmer so if you see the potential in AI agents then check out the first link in the description by the way module number four the next one where I build self-improved Ming a agents with autogen is coming in like the next 12 to 14 hours so you can set an alarm and be excited for that because it's going to teach you a lot"
