        "transcript": "so as we pivot to new Lifestyles and I still fervently believe that we are heading for post- labor economics which means that by and large most people will not need to work and in fact there might not be much work to go around at least not as we understand it today what's the number going to be right now my gut instinct is about 80% Unemployment uh now does that mean that there's going to be nothing to do absolutely not there's going to be plenty to do um it's just the fundamental social contract of exchanging your labor for money that is what is going to change now with all that being said one thing that I've been working on is post nihilism which I've talked about you know the John REI with the meaning crisis my own version of that which is the nihilistic crisis I don't need to rehash that because now what I've been working on is the solution so the solution is what I call radical alignment and uh some people don't like this idea they say it's dogmatic which if you read it I don't really get that reaction but anyways one of the first principles of radical alignment is what I call Body first living so body first living is prioritizing the needs of your animal your human animal your creature body first so that means sleeping as much as you need to sleep that means sleeping in when you need to that means obeying the circadian rhythms of your body as to when you need to sleep when you need to eat and also getting as much exercise in time of nature as you're supposed to so I'm practicing what I preach which is body first living now this seems kind of like well duh uh and there's a lot to unpack here so for instance the role of privilege only people with a lot of privilege right now can do this or you have to make structural changes to your life which might mean compromises it might mean sacrifices it might mean uh accepting a lower income also I apologize for the sun behind me I'm trying to keep uh keep the camera in the shadows but body first living is about prioritizing your body because you're a human animal over productivity over social conformance over the uh trends of today basically saying hey I'm a I'm a creature I'm an animal and I'm going to create the optimal habitat for myself so this idea came from a friend of mine and I'm not sure I think he got it from a book but he said we have to be our own alien zookeepers and so the thought experiment is imagine that a super powerful benevolent alien race comes by and says wow you humans really suck at taking care of yourselves we're going going to take care of you the way that you should be taking care of yourself and so if you do this thought experiment what principles or changes would a benevolent alien zookeeper do they'd probably get rid of fast food they'd get rid of cubicles and probably get rid of alarm clocks honestly and they'd say hey you guys are actually really social and you're spending too much time alone so let's change that you need time in nature and yet you spend a lot of time inside so let's change that and what you'd end up coming up with is a framework or a paradigm a way of living that is more focused on what we need what our bodies need now I can hear a lot of people out there bulking at this and saying wow that sounds super Draconian how would you enforce this and this is where I understand why some people could interpret this as very dogmatic but another thing is that part of our animal needs is for autonomy is for agency it's one of our Baseline psychological needs is that we need the ability to choose our own fate to make decisions for ourselves to change our beliefs and so part of body first living is it's up to you none of this is going to be enforced it's not saying like hey you know the state is now going to mandate that you must spend eight hours a day outside or else it's not what that's not what I mean it is a principle that you can adopt as an individ viil but then in the grand scheme of things imagine in the future 5 years from now 10 years from now if we get to 80% unemployment why wouldn't you live this way and then if enough people live in radical alignment live uh Embrace body first living then the state's going to have to respect that we the people will make that decision for ourselves and the rest of society will follow suit so what else goes into body first living um I already mentioned sleep exercise time and nature socializing like this is also it might sound kind of radical I mean that I call it radical alignment for a reason um but I did not come up with these ideas on my own a lot of this is based on principles from ikigai which is the Japanese concept of how to find your purpose in life it's based on Roger Walsh's uh therapeutic Lifestyle Changes TLC um so that is a very pragmatic framework for how to re revamp your life so that you're healthier have more meaning um and also what I will say is that body first living is only the first pillar of radical alignment I've got an entire framework that I'm working on I've got a book finally I have finished post nihilism after 17 drafts 87,000 words now I need to work on cleaning it up adding citations making sure that it's written in a flow state but yeah so body first living is just take a minute and imagine if you honored your body's needs Above All Else above the need to be productive above the need to be performative and you just said what does my body need at any given moment what food should I give it what exercise should I give it where should I be and I will say from firsthand experience that body first living one it is deceptively simple and very intuitive but we have so many habits and patterns built up over time that it can actually be kind of hard to break those patterns and habits because you end up doing stuff unconsciously but if more and more people do it and you're surrounded by people who do it you know so that's why I'm writing a book so that I can kind of characterize and lay it out saying here's how to do it hey maybe that would be a good idea for an app who wants to help me build a a body first living app a radical alignment app let's do it maybe I'll build a GPT anyways so this is just the introductory this is just the beginning this is what I'm pivoting all of my work to is radical alignment and systems thinking because those are the two ways that I think I can help the world the most so cheers thanks for watching have a good one"
