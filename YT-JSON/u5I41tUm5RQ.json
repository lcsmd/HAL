        "transcript": "so I just got these images from my creative director John he was playing around with a new tool and said look what I managed to generate and he sent me these images with my face on them that look awesome he made images of me as the Joker and I think maybe Captain America and Iron Manish as well as me as a wizard and maybe a vampire I don't know but they look really really good but before I go any deeper let me address the two elephants in the room yes I did get a cold while I was at CES so my voice might be a little off because I'm still getting over it and number two yes I'm wearing a sweater that looks like a rug it's very cold and rainy here in San Diego today so I busted out my cozy HubSpot sweater this video is not sponsored by them I mean it's not sponsored at all it's just a really comfortable sweater and I'm wearing it so get over it so after John sent me this initial set of images he sent me some more The Prompt for these ones were Matt as a gorilla human hybrid and apparently Matt as a gorilla human hybrid is just Dave Batista here's some with Matt as a bodybuilder flexing muscles upper body now you might be fooled into thinking these are AI but these are actually real images just ignore the fact that there's a prompt and it looks like they were AI generated these ones totally legit he also sent me these with Matt as a hockey player smiling missing a tooth I think it struggled to knock a tooth out but I definitely look like a hockey player now in the past to get images like this you had to use a crazy complicated Google collab where you adjust a whole bunch of settings and tweak a bunch of stuff and upload a whole bunch of training images and decide how many Epoch you want and it's a pretty intense process I did actually make a video about a year ago about how to train your own face into Ai and you can get much more custom and dialed into the exact image you want using that method and although these Google collabs look kind of complex and confusing conf using if you watch the video it's really not that big of a deal you just kind of follow the step-by-step process however JN made these with a tool called artflow which takes all of the confusion and complicated steps out of using something like Google collab now like I mentioned this video is not sponsored artflow has no idea I'm making this video we just came across it and were very impressed by what it could do and how easy it actually was to do what it can do now artlow which you can find over at artf flow. is actually designed to create consistent characters if you played around a lot with mid Journey or dolly or tools like that it is ridiculously hard to get any sort of consistency in the characters you create now stable diffusion is capable of doing that and from what I can tell artflow is using stable diffusion underneath the hood it's also most likely using dream Booth the same exact technique that I used to train my other like Ness into the AI under the hood as well but once you create a consistent character you can then generate images with that consistent character and even create videos with that consistent character now artflow itself isn't necessarily free they do have a free plan that gets you 100 credits a month a handful of minutes in video and it does actually have watermarks if you're using the free plan then they have other plans that give you more credits however from what I can tell one credit gives you four image Generations so you give it a prompt you get four images for that prompt and that will use one credit so 100 credits per month is roughly 400 image Generations per month and also to train your face into the AI it's actually free for your first training so if you just want to train yourself it's free to do that so I'm going to sign up for a free account real quick and once I'm logged in I'm going to click on character builder up in the left menu here we'll go ahead and press the button to create a new character it asks me to to define the character to start I'll just put white middle-age male with dark brown hair and a beard and then we have the ad consistent face button and I can click choose face and we have a whole bunch of existing faces that we can choose from and under characters we have a handful of characters that we can choose from but let's go back to actors and click train actor this is where we could train our own face into the platform here let's go ahead and click create your AI actor maale actor age adult actor name I'll just put Matt wolf as one word and then upload pictures we can drag and drop up to 20 photos here I just so happen to have 20 images of my face already in a folder on my computer from the last time I trained my face into an AI so I'll just go ahead and use these same images here drag and drop them all into our little box here and now we've got 20 images of my face and I can click start training you can see it says it might take 10 to 30 minutes to process so now we're just going to go ahead and let it run its process and we'll check back shortly if you remember when we were using the Google collab dream Booth method you actually had to leave the browser open you needed to sort of scroll around you needed to make sure the page didn't time out with this it looks like you could just step away and when it's ready you can come back and see what it's done and it took about 15 minutes you could see I now have the Matt wolf male adult here and if I tried to create another AI character you can see it now asks me to upgrade but that first training was free so let's go ahead and click on create image next to my face you can see over on the right side it actually created a whole bunch of images I didn't even prompt these these are just some of the sort of demo images I guess it created like these and these as a wizard and a couple with me as the Joker prompt on this one was Matt wolf as an invincible superhero here's some more that it generated some more that it generated that look like those vampires here's a few more and some more of me in front of a TV with you know various backgrounds and stuff so these were obviously using the same prompts as what John sent me here when he gave me the first example of what this is capable of but let's just go ahead and click on generate we'll go ahead and leave our aspect ratio on 32 they actually have this really cool director mode where if you turn this on you can actually choose how you want the character positioned in the image we want a full shot where we've got the full body we want it to be extreme closeup where we're just seeing the face so we've got some options here for our prompt we can do at Matt wolf that's our sort of key word to make sure it's generating my face we could do a prompt like Matt wolf with purple hair and a shocked expression on his face and then if we wanted we can add some negative promps I'm going to go ahead and leave that and then there's some styles by default it has cinematic selected but if we add style we've got digital art cinematic fantasy watercolor oil painting and just a ton of other potential styles that you can play with we'll go ahead and leave it on cinematic for this first test and you can see if I click generate V2 it's going to use just one credit again the free plan gives you 100 credits a month so let's go ahead and click generate and after about 20 seconds it generated four Images didn't do a great job with the shocked expression but it did give me purple hair and a couple of them and it even gives me the option to animate so if I click animate it brings me to this Animation Studio here and I can enter some dialogue I can have it say subscribe to Matt wolf on YouTube and if I click export and animate you can see it will use two credits to make this short clip and after a few seconds we get a video that looks like this subscribe to Matt wolf on YouTube now it's not perfect and it's definitely not my voice you do have the option to upload your own audio file so you could record an audio file of yourself speaking or create an audio file from 11 Labs that that's trained on your voice pull it into the upload section here and actually make it sound like you but still what I'm most impressed with by this artflow AI tool is the ability to quickly train your own face in and then generate any images you can imagine trained on your own face let's try one more time this time I'm going to leave director mode off Matt wolf as Superman flying above a city skyline and well it made an attempt as we know with AI art sometimes it takes a few prompts to get exactly what you're looking for here's what it thinks I'd look like as the Hulk here's me as a newscaster which is something I often create as part of my thumbnail strategy and here's one of me as a Viking Warrior now again I can't get him as quite dialed in and perfect like I can with dream booth and stable diffusion using something like automatic 11-11 or comfy UI but I can generate some images that look like my face on whatever subject I'm trying to put them on and it is probably 10 times faster than trying to do it with dream booth so if you just need a couple images here and there with your own face trained into the ai artflow ai is perfect for that and you can pretty much do everything you need to for free unless you need to train more than one model or you're planning on generating more than 400 images a month with it in which case it's probably worth paying the extra few bucks and being able to create a lot more Generations now if you love nerding out about Ai and the coolest AI tools as much as I do make sure you check out futur tools. this is is the website where I curate all of the cool AI tools
