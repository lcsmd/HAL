        "transcript": "so in the prior video in this six part series we talked about GPT or our GPT assistance announced by open AI in November of 2023 game changers for business professionals looking to 10x with AI in today's video the second video in this series we're going to talk about what sets GPT assistance apart remember how we've always talked about the dream of having AI just dive into our unique confidential data and get to get to work on our specific tasks and have our specific knowledge available to the GPT well guess what that day is finally here open AI announced gpts or GPT assistant and these truly are gamechanging tools so in our previous video we introduced gpts and discussed their importance for business professionals wanting to 10x using AI in this video we're going to take a deep dive into what makes gpts different from any other generative AI technology or app that's out there in our exploration of GPT technology in these video series we've made an important distinction between General AI tools like chat GPT the web app and more specialized GPT assistance while both of these tools the web app that's been available for about 9 months now and these new gpts while both are based on the same underlying technology their application and functionalities differ significantly especially for business users so watch until the end of this video and I'm going to share a list of 10 key advantages of gpts for business professionals this list is going to help you understand the importance of gpts in the development of AI tools for your your business for you to 10x your specific abilities in your specific industry so let's get into the differences between gpts and chat GPT these gpts as open AI refers to them or GPT assistants to try and be a little bit more descriptive about what they do these GPT assistants they're highly customizable assistance that you program using plain English as opposed to software program language and they're trained on your preferences in your the world of generative AI we call this kind of instruction PR engineering we prompt constantly as we interact with these CH GP chat Bots prompting means we speak to the assistant our input the stuff we type this is the prompt and we get good at these prompts when we practice and when we get really good we actually start engaging in in prompt engineering think of prompt engineering as software code spoken in plain English or complex algorithms that anyone can create and use on an AI model by simply speaking instructions to the AI chatbot we provide in in our case our professional User Group our community of members we provide free prompt engineering spreadsheets you go ahead and sign up for those in the description and I and I have some news for you even though those spreadsheets that we shared many months ago uh were comprehensive they're still Mission critical and prompt engineering Remains the most critical skill for any business professional looking to leverage GPT assistance the tips and the tricks that we provided you in those prompt engineering spreadsheets remain really critical pieces of information so you can create high-powered accurate and customized gpts in in our Advanced prompt engineering spreadsheet you might recall we discussed speaking to GPT chapot using things like roles what role are you what role is the chatbot tasks What specifically are you asking that assistant that chapot to do providing the assistant the GPT context what do it what does it need to know in order to do the task what would you tell your assistant your paralal your locker but you tell them and provide to them by context so that they knew what you wanted for the deliverable you might recall we talked in in those prompt engineering spreadsheets about providing examples to the chat GPT web interface and asking it for a particular format and output do you want in spreadsheet format plain text do you want it to be in a mind map format you can you can ask for a spefic specific format when you're assigning the task to your assistant and of course you have to always provide the the correct tone what do you want it to be providing output for formal tone friendly tone informal tone so these are the types of things that we taught when we taught you about PRT engineering and we provided really solid examples of great strategic approaches to prop day and you're going to use those same skills and customizing your gpts we going to be building in future episodes so we're going to get deeper into the prompt engineering of chat gpts in our next video in this series today we're going to be trying to really help you understand the difference between the web interface for Chad GPT that web app and these gpts which are a recent tool announced by open AI so here's the next important thing you need to know about these gpts or GPT assistant each GPT can be preloaded with knowledge this could be any uploading content such as case pleadings research reports company data spreadsheets business plans anything so gpts are built on Chad GPT 4 Turbo which is also recently announced by by Chad GPT so you can now upload up to 300 pages of your specific information into the GPT it stor is that every time you access that GPT assistant it's already got that information preloaded into it so providing the GPT with specific knowledge is going to make that GPT an expert and therefore a great assistant to you and a compliment to your expertise all right let's dive into some specific GPT examples so you can understand the nuances and impact of what I've told you thus far remember we're going to get to these these these tips but before we do let's go ahead and and see if we can make this a little bit more concrete what can a GPT do let's pretend that you're a marketing manager in a fintech startup specializing in AI for Bitcoin fund management all right that's a mouthful that's a very specific job that you might have that I might have so the marketing manager let's let's think about what that marketing manager might need in that ftech startup that marketing manager might need to design a campaign an advertising marketing campaign targeting Bitcoin fund managers in the United States showcasing the fintech startups AI tools that are designed for cryptocurrency portfolio optimization wow so you are going to design a prep you're going to engineer a prep specific to that task for that job in that industry so let me give you an example one one promt might be to preload into the GPT assistant this instruction develop a targeted marketing strategy to appeal to bitcoin fund managers emphasizing your tools AI driven analytics and predictive capabilities for cryptocurrency investment include Specialized webinars or industry specific SEO content and Linkedin and in a LinkedIn Outreach plan so that's the job that you've given this GPT assistant right so you've told that GPT assistant they're going to develop a marketing strategy the target audience is Bitcoin fund managers you told it what to emphasize the fact that your AI tool is driven by analytics and predictive capabilities for specifically for cryptocurrency investment and now you're telling it further instruction include specialized in the marketing plan include specialized webinars SEO content and specifically a LinkedIn Outreach plan that is all B laked into this assistant now you're going to launch that assistant and it's going to have all that prompt engineering stored in it now the next big thing that you can do is when you're creating this assistant for this for this Aid driven uh company you can upload knowledge so you might upload into this assistant above and beyond the promp that you've provided it documents such as reports on cryptocurrency market trends you could put in your company's investment strategies for Bitcoin digital Market marketing strategies that are effective in the in the fintech space you might find articles online about that SEO strategies for finance related content you might find information about that you might generate a report on that you might have a report for that and you might provide a LinkedIn marketing techniques or strategies that are suitable for reaching fund managers all right that would be an assistant that you would create for the specific task of help helping you remember where we started marketing manager needs to help designing a campaign targeting Bitcoin fund managers in the United States showcasing the fintex startups AI tools designed for cryptocurrency portfolio optimization you've created tools specifically for that you've given it a very detailed PR you've uploaded specialized knowledge it's now going to help you do that right so you could do the same thing if you are a marketing manager for a highend sustainable fashion brand they're just examples and you're going to do a very complex engineer prop with all the different elements of a good prop in it you are going to provide uploaded information that can be thirdparty information or information specifically from your company and then that system is going to be standing ready 24x7 to help you market and sell whatever it is that you're selling or draft whatever it is you're Drafting and you can follow you can create a a GPT for for just about anything an assistant for just about anything A specialized assistant for each job and you can follow the same process if you are a lawyer uploading documents from a specific case or the entire communication negotiation drafting history for a specific contract or to help you draft and negotiate a contract you can build a GPT for complex tasks that you engage in Daily at work or special projects or long-term projects that you know you're going to need an assistant for overtime in each of these scenarios each GPT assistant executes a task and provides specialized expertise and a specialized solution tailored to very specific customized information needs and context all right so that's what you can do with a gbt assistant and keep in mind in the future videos we're going to teach you how to actually build one so make sure you subscribe so you get notice of that and what we're going to talk talk about next is this t 10 key advantages of using the G these gpts at work this is really important to understand the advantages because the nuances of why these are special they really help you get in the right mindset for how best to create an assistant and for what jobs you should be creating an assistant in your everyday work life and so instead of just going to chat GPT web app anymore you're going to start creating assistance for each specialized job that you have all right 10 key advantages very important the first one is efficiency and information retention unlike chat GPT web app where you need to upload knowledge content context a new with every session a GPT assistant retains this information this means that once you've uploaded specific industry knowledge client details project information the specialized assistant is going to maintain this data across sessions you can come back in two mon months it's going to have all this knowledge still baked into it and it's going to eliminate the need for repetitive uploads or contact setting or prompt engineering it's going to have all of that created and built right into it right so this is going to help streamline your workflow uh in ways that just were not possible with the chat GPT web interface two chat GPT assistants or GPT they learn and adapt over time they have the capab ability to learn from interactions and refine their responses based on past inputs and Corrections this is crucial for business professionals as it means the assistant becomes more aligned with your specific style or needs or preferences over time they get better they get they go from a new assistant to you know an assistant that's been with you for for a year to an assistant that's been with you forever so they keep getting better that right there is magical they're going to be really enhanced over time and if you feel like you want them to do things a little bit different you just go change the prompt in the back end of the system or add more knowledge and you just keep building that assistant to be better number three this continual customization improvement with each iteration and interaction you can build upon and refine your GPT assistance capabilities ongoing customization is going to be the key because you're going to continue to go from a 2X to a 5x to a 10x the more you manage the more you interact the more you iterate on this assistant and this ongoing customization it's going to allow the assistant to essentially evolve with your changing business needs with your own expertise and so it's going to adapt over time and continue to be relevant and valuable as time goes on number four gpts are they're finally tuned for specific tasks within your industry so you're going to create lots of gpts for very unique things and whether it's creating a targeted marketing campaign or analyzing financial data or drafting legal documents you're going to create an assistant for each task and you're going to build that assistant out to do that job really really well so General AI tools simply can't do that and this is a massive step forward for generative AI because we haven't had this kind of capability before now we do all right number five consistency and reliability since these assistants retain knowledge and learn over time they're going to provide consistent level of service as your assistant and this reliability is key in a professional setting where inconsistency or unreliability uh is really not going to be acceptable it's going to keep you from getting to the multiple that you're looking for in your amplification all right number six personalization and user experience the assistants are going to offer a more personalized user experience for you they can be tailored to not only understand your business jargon but mimic your preferred tone style of communication your these interactions are going to be more aligned to who you are and they're going to be more natural and efficient seven privacy and security with GPT assistance there's more control over data privacy and security and since they can be configured for specific tasks and users sensitive information can be better managed and protected which is especially important for us professional users of AI all right so eight you want to think of these assistants as a highly skilled specialized team member who not only understands your specific business needs but also grows and adapts with you and your company and offers a level of support and efficiency that that is really going to be something you're going to have to learn how to work with um in order to get the most out of it and it can be an invaluable asset in any professional setting but you are going to have to evolve with it and we talk a lot in in this community about mindset you have to have the right mindset when you're working with these GPT web apps with the assistance with the gpts you have to think in a certain way in order to get the most out of your AI all right so nine is is this beautiful thing called tokens and they canot only take they can take up to 300 pages of uploaded data but they can also um connect to external sources of data your proprietary data so you can now with these gpts harness realtime information analytics that are just designed specific for your business goals based on your proprietary business information it's going to give you a huge Competitive Edge and you're going to be able to integrate diverse data streams into your into your workflow on a daily basis all right so 10 is that um you want to understand that the AI systems these gpts can be programmed to perform tasks such as sending emails or sking scheduling calendar invites so not only provide output help you draft or whatever answer questions it could actually execute tasks this means that gpts can be figured can be configured to automatically for instance draft and send personaliz these mails um based on some analysis or specific trigger they can organize and manage schedules in so much more over time as these tools evolve these integration capabilities of GPT assistance are the things that really set them apart and they can seamlessly integrate into whatever business workflow that you want to start start with and really help you with productivity and decision making all right so this is just the beginning these gpts that are available right now and while we're going to see this Tech get even more mind-blowing
