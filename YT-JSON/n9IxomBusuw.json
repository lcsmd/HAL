        "description": "In this episode, I am joined by Dr. David Sinclair, tenured Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and an expert researcher in the field of longevity. Dr. Sinclair is also the author of the book Lifespan: Why We Age & Why We Don't Have To, and the host of the Lifespan Podcast, which launches January 5, 2022. \n\nIn this interview, we discuss the cellular and molecular mechanisms of aging and what we all can do to slow or reverse the aging process. We discuss fasting and supplementation with resveratrol, NAD, metformin, and NMN. We also discuss the use of caffeine, exercise, cold exposure, and why excessive iron load is bad for us. We discuss food choices for offsetting aging and promoting autophagy (clearance of dead cells). And we discuss the key blood markers everyone should monitor to determine your biological versus chronological age. We also discuss the future of longevity research and technology. This episode includes lots of basic science and specific, actionable protocols, right down to the details of what to do and when. By the end, you will have in-depth knowledge of the biology of aging and how to offset it.\n\n#HubermanLab #DavidSinclair #Longevity\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\nROKA - https://www.roka.com/huberman\nInsideTracker - https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nMagic Spoon - https://www.magicspoon.com/huberman\n\nDr. David Sinclair Links:\nLifespan Podcast: https://lifespanpodcast.com\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/davidasinclair \nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/davidsinclairphd/ \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/davidsinclairpodcast \nLifespan (book): https://amzn.to/47MLimC\nAging Test Waitlist: https://www.tallyhealth.com\nHarvard Lab Website: https://sinclair.hms.harvard.edu\n\nOur Patreon page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman\n\nSupplements from Thorne:\nhttp://www.thorne.com/u/huberman\n\nSocial:\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/hubermanlab\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab\nWebsite - https://hubermanlab.com\nNewsletter - https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00:00 Dr. David Sinclair, Harvard Medical School\n00:03:30 ROKA, InsideTracker, Magic Spoon\n00:07:45 “Aging as a Disease” vs. Longevity & Anti-Aging\n00:10:23 What Causes Aging?

        "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast, where we discuss science\nand science-based tools for everyday life. I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine. Today, my guest is Dr. David Sinclair, professor of genetics at\nHarvard Medical School and co-director of the\nPaul F. Glenn Center for the Biology of Aging. Dr. Sinclair's work is\nfocused on why we age and how to slow or reverse\nthe effects of aging by focusing on the cellular\nand molecular pathways that exist in all cells of\nthe body and that progress those cells over time from\nyoung cells to old cells. By elucidating the biology of\ncellular maturation and aging, Dr. Sinclair's group has\nfigured out intervention points by which any of us indeed, all of us, can slow or reverse the effects of aging. What is unique about his work is that it focuses on\nbehavioral interventions, nutritional interventions,\nas well as supplementation and prescription drug\ninterventions that can help us all age more slowly and reverse\nthe effects of aging in all tissues of the body. Dr. Sinclair holds a unique\nand revolutionary view of the aging process, which is that aging is not the normal and natural consequence that we all will suffer. But rather that aging is a disease that can be slowed or halted. Dr. Sinclair continually publishes original research articles\nin the most prestigious and competitive scientific journals. In addition to that, he's\npublished a popular book that was a New York Times bestseller. The title of that book, is 'Lifespan: Why We Age And Why We Don't Have To.' He is also very active\nin public facing efforts to educate people on the biology of aging and slowing the aging process. Dr. Sinclair, and I\nshare a mutual interest and excitement in public\neducation about science. And so I'm thrilled to share\nwith you that we've partnered. And Dr. David Sinclair\nis going to be launching the lifespan podcast, which is all about the\nbiology of aging and tools to intervene in the aging process. That podcast will launch\nWednesday, January 5th. You can find it at the\nlink in the show notes to this episode today as well. You can subscribe to that\npodcast on YouTube, Apple, or Spotify, or anywhere\nthat you get your podcasts. Again, the lifespan podcast\nfeaturing Dr. David Sinclair, Claire begins Wednesday,\nJanuary 5th, 2022, be sure to check it out. You're going to learn a\ntremendous amount of information, and you're going to learn\nboth the mechanistic science behind aging, the\nmechanistic science behind reversing the aging\nprocess and practical tools that you can apply in your everyday life. In today's episode, Dr. Sinclair and I talk about the biology of aging and tools to intervene in that process. And so you might view today's episode as a primer for the lifespan podcast, because we delve deep\ninto the behavioral tools, nutritional aspects,\nsupplementation aspects of the biology of aging. We also talk about David's\nimportant discoveries of the sirtuins, particular components that influence what is\ncalled the epigenome. And if you don't know\nwhat the epigenome is, you will soon learn in today's episode. Coming away from today's episode, you will have in-depth knowledge\nabout the biology of aging at the cellular, molecular, and what we call the circuit level, meaning how the different\norgans and tissues of the bodies age independently, and how they influence the aging of each other. Today's episode gets into discussion about many aspects of aging and tools to combat aging that have not been discussed\non any other podcasts or in the book lifespan. Before we begin, I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford. It is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science and science related tools\nto the general public. In keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast. Our first sponsor is ROKA. ROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are the absolute highest quality. I've spent a lifetime\nworking on the visual system. And I can tell you that the visual system has to contend with a number\nof different challenges, such as when you move\nfrom a bright area outside to an area where there are shadows, you have to adjust a number of\nthings in your visual system so that you can still see things clearly. One problem with a lot of\neyeglasses and sunglasses is they don't take that\nbiological feature into account. And you have to take off your\nglasses and put them back on, depending on how bright or\ndim a given environment is. With ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses, you always see things\nwith the utmost clarity. In addition, they're very lightweight and they won't slip off your face. In fact, they were designed to be worn while biking or running\nand the various activities, but they also have a terrific aesthetic, so you could wear them to dinner or work. I wear readers at night and when I drive and I wear the sunglasses\nfor most of the day. If you'd like to try ROKA\nsunglasses or eyeglasses, you can go to roka.com, that's roka.com and enter the code Huberman, to save 20% off your first order. Again, that's ROKA, roka.com\nand enter the code Huberman at checkout. Today's episode is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker. InsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals. I've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done for the simple reason\nthat many of the factors that impact your immediate\nand long-term health can only be assessed from\na quality blood test. And now with the advent\nof modern DNA tests, you can also get a clear picture of what your biological age is and compare that to\nyour chronological age. And obviously your biological\nage is the important one because it predicts how long you will live and it's the one that you can control. The great thing about InsideTracker is that compared to a\nlot of other DNA tests and blood tests out there\nis that with InsideTracker, you don't just get your numbers back at the levels of various\nhormones, metabolic factors, blood lipids, et cetera, but it also offers clear\ndirectives to lifestyle factors, nutritional factors and\nsupplementation that you can use in order to get the\nnumbers into the ranges that are best for you and for your health.

Magic Spoon is a zero sugar, grain-free, keto friendly cereal. Now I don't follow a\nstrictly ketogenic diet. What works best for me is to eat according to my desire to be alert\nat certain times of day and to be sleepy at other times of day. So for me, that means\nfasting until about 11:00 AM or 12 noon most days. And then my lunch is typically\na low carb, ketoish lunch, maybe a small piece of grass-fed meat, some salad, something of that sort. And then in the afternoon,\nI might have a snack that's also ketoish. And then at night is when\nI eat my carbohydrates, which for me helps me with\nthe transition to sleep and allows me to get great deep sleep. That's what works for me. What that means is in the\nafternoon I'm craving a snack. And the snack for me is Magic Spoon. What I do lately is I put\nin some Bulgarian yogurt. Sometimes I just eat it straight. Each serving of Magic Spoon\nhas zero grams of sugar, 13 to 14 grams of protein and only four grams of\ncarbohydrates in each serving. So it really matches that\nlow carb ketoish approach. There's only 140 calories per serving, and they have a variety of flavors. Coco, fruity, peanut butter or frosted. I particularly like frosted\n'cause it tastes like donuts. I try not to eat donuts,\nbut I do love the frost. And as I mentioned before, I lately mix it with yogurt\npolo cinnamon on there. I'm getting hungry just talking about it.

It's good to see you. - This is mate by the way, that\nwe're toasting at 11:00 AM. Unlike other podcasts, we,\nwell, I don't drink alcohol, so I'm boring that way. But truly, thanks for being here, I have a ton of questions for you. We go way back in some sense, but that doesn't mean that I don't have many, many questions about\naging, longevity, lifespan, actionable protocols to increase how long we live, et cetera. And I just want to start off\nwith a very simple question. I'm not even sure there's an answer to, but what is the difference\nbetween longevity, anti-aging and aging as a disease? Because I associate\nyou with the statement, aging is a disease. - Right? Well, so longevity is\nthe more academic way we describe what we research. Anti-aging is kind of the same thing, but it's got a bad rap\nbecause it's been used by a whole bunch of people that don't know what they're talking about. So I really don't like\nthat term anti-aging, but aging is a disease and longevity are perfectly valid ways\nto talk about this subject. So let's talk about aging as a disease. When I started my research, disease here at Harvard Medical School, it was considered, if there's something\nthat's wrong with you. and it's a rare thing, it has to be less than\n50% of the population, that's definitely a disease, and then people work their whole lives to try and cure that condition. And so I looked up, what's the definition of aging and it says, well, it's\na deterioration in health and sickness and you can die\nfrom it, typically you do. Something that sounds\npretty much like a disease, but the caveat is that if\nmore than half the population gets this condition, aging,\nit's put in a different bucket. Which is first of all, that's outrageous, 'cause it's just a\ntotally arbitrary cutoff. But think about this, that we're ignoring the major\n'cause of all these diseases. Aging is 80 to 90% the cause\nof heart disease, Alzheimer's. If we didn't get old and\nour bodies stayed youthful, we would not get those diseases. And actually what we're\nshowing in my lab is, if you turn the clock back, in tissues, those diseases go away. So aging is the problem\nand instead through, most of the last 200 years, we've been sticking band-aids on diseases that have already\noccurred because of aging and then it's too late. So there are a couple of things. One is we want to slow aging down so we don't get those diseases\nand when they do occur, don't just take a bandaid on, reverse the age of the body and then the diseases will go away. - That clarifies a lot for me, thank you. Can we point to one specific\ngeneral phenomenon in the body that underlies aging? - Yeah, well, that's contentious because scientists like to\ncome up with new hypothesis. It's how they build their careers. But fortunately during the two thousands, we settled on eight or\nnine major causes of aging. We call them hallmarks 'cause causes was a little bit too strong, but these eight or nine causes, at least for the first time\nallowed us to come around and talk together. And we put them on a pizza so everyone got an equal\nweighting, equal slices. But before that, by the way, we were trying to kill\neach other in the field, that was horrible. - Interesting that you guys work on aging and you're trying to kill each other. - Yeah, isn't it? Well kill each other's careers. Well I like to think\nI was fairly generous, but I was one of the kids and the old guard really\ndidn't like the new guard. We just came along in the 1990s and said, free radicals don't do much. They're actually genes\ncalled longevity genes. And that caused a whole ruckus. And there was this competition\nfor what never happened, which was a Nobel prize for this. And it just led to a lot of competition. I would go to meetings and\npeople would shout at each other and backstab, it was horrible. But then unfortunately\nin the two thousands, we rallied around this new map of aging with these causes of hallmarks. But I think that there's\none slice of the pizza that is way larger than the others. And we can get to that, but that's the information in the cell that we call the epigenome. - Well tell us a little bit\nmore about the epigenome, frame it for us if you will,\nand then we'll get into ways that one can adjust the\nepigenome in positive ways. - Yeah, so in science, what I like to do, a reductionist is to boil it down and I actually ended up boiling, aging down to an equation, which is the loss of\ninformation due to entropy. It's a hard thing to overcome,\nsecond law of thermodynamics. That's fair, but this\nequation really represents the fact that I think aging\nis a loss of information in the same way that\nwhen you xerox something, a thousand times you'll\nlose that information or you try to copy a cassette tape. Or even if you send information\nacross the internet, some of it will get lost. That's what I think is aging. And there were two types\nof information in the body. There is the genetic\ninformation, which is digital. ATCG the chemical letters of DNA, but there's this other part of\nthe information in the body. that's just as important,\nit's essential, in fact, and that's the systems\nthat control which genes are switched on and off\nin what cell at what time in response to what we eat, et cetera. And it turns out that 80% of\nour future longevity and health is controlled by the second part, the epigenetic information,\nthe control systems. I liken the DNA to the\nmusic that's on a DVD or a compact disc for the younger people. We used to use these things. - I recall. - Yeah, and then the epigenome\nis the reader that says, okay, in this cell we need\nto play that set of songs and in this other cell, we have to play a different set of songs. But over time, aging is the\nequivalent of scratching, the CD and the DVD so that you, you're not playing the\nright songs and cells when they don't hear the right songs, they get messed up and\nthey don't function well. And that is what I'm saying\nis the main driver of aging. And these other hallmarks\nare largely manifestations of that process. - Can we go a little deeper into what that these scratches are. Is it the way that the DNA\nare packed into a cell? Is it the way that they're spaced? What are the scratches\nthat you're referring to? - So DNA is six foot long. So if you join your chromosomes together, you get a six foot post-sale. So there's enough to go to\nthe moon and back eight times in your body. And it has to be wrapped\nup to exist inside us, but it's not just wrapped up willy-nilly. It's not just a bundle of string, it's wrapped up very carefully in ways that dictates which genes\nare switched on and off. And when we're developing in the embryo, the cell marks the DNA\nwith chemicals that says, okay, this gene is for a nerve cell. Your cell will stay a nerve cell for the next a hundred\nyears, if you're lucky. Don't turn into a skin\ncell that would be bad. And those chemicals, there are many different\ntypes of chemicals, but one's called methylation. Those little menthols will\nmark which songs get played for the rest of your life. And there are other that change daily. But in total, what we're\nsaying is that the body controls the genome through\nthe ability to mark the DNA and then compact some parts\nof it, silence those genes, don't read those genes and\nopen others, keep others open that should stay open. And that pattern of genes\nthat are silent and open, silent, open, is what\ndictates the cells type the cells function. And then the scratches are\nthe disruption of that. So genes that were once\nsilent and you could say, it's a gene that is involved in skin. It's starting to come on in\nthe brain, shouldn't be there, but we see this happen and vice versa, the gene might get shut\noff over time during aging. Cells over time, lose these structures, lose their identity, they forget what they're supposed to do and we get diseases. We call that aging and\nwe can measure that. In fact, we can measure it in such a way that we can predict when\nsomebody is going to die based on the changes in those chemicals. - Are these changes, the\nsame sorts of changes that underlie the outward\nbody surface manifestations of aging, that most of\nus are familiar with, graying of the hair,\nwrinkling of the skin, drooping of the face. Walking around New York lately, it's amazing to me,\nthere are certain people that seem to walk looking\ndown at the sidewalk because their spine is\nessentially in a C shape, right? A hallmark, if you will, of aging, that most of us are familiar with. Are the same sorts of DNA\nscratches associated with that? Or are we talking about people that are potentially\nare going to look older, but simply live longer? - Well, it's actually, you\nare as old as you look, if you want to generalize. So let's start with centenarian families. These are families that\ntend to live over a hundred. When they're 70, they\nstill look 50 or less. So it is a good indicator. It's not perfect because you can like me\ngrowing up in Australia and accelerate the aging of your skin. But in general, how you look, and no one's ever died from gray hair, but overall you can get a sense just from the ability of\nskin to hold itself up, how thin it is, the number of wrinkles. A great paper just came out that said that an AI System looking at the face could very accurately\npredict someone's age. - Very interesting. So I started off in\ndevelopmental neurobiology. So one of the things\nthat I learned early on that I still believe wholeheartedly is that development doesn't\nstop at age 12 or 15 or even 25 that your entire life is\none long developmental arc. So in thinking about different portions of that developmental arc,\nthe early portion of infancy, and especially puberty, seem\nlike especially rapid stages of aging. And I know we normally\nlook at babies and children and kids in puberty, and we\nthink, oh, they're so vital, they're so young. And yet the way you describe\nthese changes in the epigenome and the way you have\nframed aging as a disease leads me to ask are periods\nof immense vitality, the same periods when we're aging faster. - Yes, yes. And this is something\nI've never talked about, at least not publicly. So this is a really good question. So those chemicals we can measure, it's also known as the Horvath's clock. It's the biological clock, it's separate from your chronological age. So actually what I didn't mention is that when the AI looked\nat the faces of those people, they could predict their\nbiological age, their internal age. So your skin represents the\nage of your organs as well. And the people that look after themselves, we can talk about how to do that later. But there are some people\nthat are 10, 20 years younger than other people biologically and it turns out if you\nmeasure that clock from birth or even before birth,\nif you look at animals, there's a massive increase\nin age, based on that clock, early in life. So you're right, so that's\na really important point, that you have accelerated aging during the first few years of life, and then it goes linear\ntowards the rest of your life. But there's another interesting\nthing that you brought up, which is that we're finding that the genes that get messed up, that get scratched that are leading to aging are those early developmental genes. They come on late in life\nand just mess up the system and they seem to be\nparticularly susceptible to those scratches. So what's causing the scratches? Well, we know of a couple\nof things in my lab, we figured out. One is broken chromosomes, DNA damage, particularly cuts to the DNA breaks. So if you have an x-ray or a cosmic ray, or even if you go out in the sun and you'll get your broken chromosomes that accelerates the unwinding\nof those beautiful DNA loops that I mentioned. We can actually do this to a mouse. We can accelerate that process\nand we get an old mouse, 50% older, and it has\nthis bent spine kyphosis. it has gray hair, it's organs are old. So we now can control aging,\nthe forwards direction. The other thing that accelerates aging is massive cell damage or stress. So we pinched nerves and we\nsaw that their aging process was accelerated as well. - Incredible, this is more\nof an anecdotal phenomenon. It is an anecdotal phenomenon, but at this experience\nof in junior high school, going home for a summer and you come back and then high school in the US usually starts eighth or ninth grade, or grade eight or grade\nnine for you Canadians. And then some of the kids, like they grew beards over the summer, or they completely matured\nquickly over the summer. Do you think there's any reason to believe that rates of entry\ninto and through puberty can predict overall rates of aging? In other words, if a kid\nis a slow burner, right? They basically acquire\nthe traits of puberty slowly over many years. Can we make some course prediction that they are going to live a long time versus a kid that goes home for the summer and comes back a completely\ndifferent organism or appearing to be a\ncompletely different organism. Like they basically age\nvery quickly in the summer. Does that mean they're\naging very quickly overall? - Well, yeah, I don't\nwant to scare anybody. - Sure. - That there are studies that show that the slower you take to\ndevelop it also is predictive of having a longer, healthier life. And it may have something\nto do with growth hormone. We know that growth hormone is pro-aging. Anyone who's taking growth\nhormone, pay attention. - Just look at someone\nwho's taking growth hormone. - Yeah. - They often will acquire these\ncharacteristics of vitality, like improved a smoothness of skin, but their whole body shape changes often. - Yeah, I mean you'll feel better for a short amount of time. You'll build up muscle, you feel great, but it's like burning\nyour candle at both ends. Ultimately, if you want to live longer, you want less of that. And the animals that have been generated and mutants that have low growth hormone, or sometimes these are dwarfs,\nthey live the longest by far. A guy in my lab, Michael Bankowski, he had the longest lived mouse, a mouse typically lives\nabout two and a bit years. He had a mouse that lived five years and he gave it chloric\nrestriction, so fasting, combined with one of\nthese dwarf mutations, low growth hormone, I\nthink he called it Yoda. You look at who lives the longest, it's the really small people. This is a bit anecdotal, but it sounds like it might be true, is that the people who\nplayed the munchkins in the Wizard of Oz, many\nof them went on to live into their nineties and beyond. - Really? - Yeah. - Huh, amazing. - And are there are some\nLauren dwarfs as well? There are dwarf mutations in South America and they seem to be protected against many of the diseases of aging. You barely ever see heart disease or cancer in these families. - So I having owned a\nvery large dog breed, a bulldog Mastiff who lived\na long life for a bulldog, 11 years, but there are\nmany dogs that will live 12, 16 years that are smaller dogs. Can we say that there's\na direct relationship between body size and\nlongevity or duration of life? - Well, there is, but that\ndoesn't mean that you're a slave to your early epigenome\nnor have to your genome. The good news is that\nthe epigenome can change. Those loops and structures can be modified by how you live your life. And so if you're born tall and I wasn't, and I wished at the time I did grow, but no matter what size you are, you can have a bigger impact on your life than anything your genes give you. 80% is epigenetic not genetic. - So let's talk about some of\nthe things that people can do. And I've kind of batch\nthese into categories rather than just diving right\ninto actionable protocols. So the first one relates to\nfood, blood sugar, insulin. This is something I hear a lot about, that fasting is good for us, but rarely do I hear why it's good for us. One of the reasons I'm\nexcited to talk to you today is because I want to drill\ninto the details of this because I think\nunderstanding the mechanism will allow people to make better choices and not simply to just\ndecide whether or not they're going to fast or not fast, or how long they're going to fast, I think should be dictated\nby someone understanding of the mechanism. So why is it that having\nelevated blood sugar, glucose and insulin ages us more quickly and or why is it that having\nperiods of time each day or perhaps longer can extend our lifespan? - Well, let's start with what\nI think was a big mistake was the idea that people\nshould never be hungry. We live in a world now where there's at least three meals a day, and then we've got companies\nselling bars and snacks in between. So the feeling of hunger, some people never experienced\nhunger in their whole lives. It's really, really bad for them. It was based, I believe\non the 20th century view that you don't want to\nstress out the pancreas and you try to keep insulin\nlevels pretty steady and not have this fluctuation. What we actually found,\nmy colleagues and I, across this field of longevity is that when you look\nat first of all animals, whether it's a dog or a mouse or a monkey, the ones that live the\nlongest by far 30% longer and stay healthy are the ones\nthat don't eat all the time actually was first discovered back in the early 20th century,\nbut people ignored it. And then it was rediscovered in the 1930s, Claude McKay did Clark restriction. He put cellulose in the food of rats, so they couldn't get as many\ncalories even though they ate. And those rats lived 30% longer, but then it went away\nand then it came back in the 2000's in a big way, when a couple of things happened, one is that my lab and others showed that there were longevity\ngenes in the body that come on and protect\nus from aging and disease. The group of genes that I\nwork on are called sirtuins there's seven of them. And we show it in 2005 in a science paper, that if you have low levels of insulin and another molecule called\ninsulin like growth factor, those low levels turn\non the longevity genes. One of them that's really\nimportant is called SIRT1. But by having high levels\nof insulin all day, being fed, means your longevity\ngenes are not switched on. So you're falling apart, your\nepigenome, your information, that keeps your cells\nfunctioning over time, just degrades quick. Your clock is ticking\nfaster by always being fed. Okay. The other thing that I\nthink might be happening by always having food around is that it's not allowing the\ncell to have periods of rest and re-establish the epigenome. And so it also is accelerating\nin that direction. There's plenty of other reasons as well, that are not as profound, such as having low levels\nof glucose in your body will trigger your major\nmuscles in your brain to become more sensitive to insulin and suck the glucose\nout of your bloodstream, which is very good. You don't want to have glucose\nflowing around too much, and that will ward off type two diabetes. - So hunger of course is\nassociated with low blood glucose and low insulin. Do you think there's anything about the subjective\nexperience of hunger itself that could be beneficial for longevity? - Yeah, I do, though you get used to\nthe feeling of not eating, so I'm kind of screwed that way. - It's like cold water,\nyou eventually adapt. - You get used to it, unfortunately, but there are some studies\nthat are being done at the National Institutes of Health that are able to simulate\nthe effect of hunger, but still provide the calories. And it's looking like\nthere's a small component that's due to hunger, but most of it, actually, is because\nyou've got these periods of not being fed and then the body turns on these defensive genes. There's a really interesting experiment that was published maybe\na couple of years ago by Rafael de Cabo down at the NIH. What he did was he took over 10,000 mice and gave them different combinations of fat, carbohydrate, protein. And he was trying to figure out what was the best combination. And then you also cleverly had a group. Well, two groups, one\nthat was fed all the time or ate as much as they wanted and the other group was only\ngiven food for an hour a day. And it turns out they ate roughly the same amount of calories, 'cause of course in an hour\nthey're stuffing their faces. It turns out it didn't matter\nwhat diet he gave them, it was only the group that\nate within that window that lived longer and dramatically longer. So my conclusion is, and mice are very similar\nto us, metabolically, I think that tells us that\nit's not as important, what you eat, it's when\nyou eat during the day. - What is the protocol that people can extrapolate from that? Or maybe I should just ask you, what is your protocol for when to eat and when to avoid food? Do you fast, do you ever\nfast, longer than 24 hours? What do you do? And what do you think is\na good jumping off place if people want to explore\nthis as a protocol? - Well, if there's one thing I could say, I would say definitely\ntry to skip a meal a day, that's the best thing. - Does it matter which meal or they're essentially equivalent? - Well, as long as it's at the end or the beginning of the day, because then you add\nthat to the sleep period where you're hopefully not eating. - I think that that's an excellent point. I realized it's a simple one, but I think it's an excellent one 'cause I think one of\nthe things that people struggle with the most\nis knowing when and how to initiate this so-called\nintermittent and fasting. And the middle of the day\nobviously is not tacked to the sleep cycle in the same way. So it's much harder as\nwell for many people. - Yeah, well, I'll tell you what I do. I skip breakfast, I have a\ntiny bit of yogurt or olive oil because the supplements I have\nneed to be dissolved in it. And then I go throughout the whole day, as I'm doing right now, here\nwith this glass of water here, I'm just keeping myself\nfilled with liquids. And so I don't feel hungry, be aware that the first\ntwo to three weeks, when you try that you will feel hungry and you also have a habit of wanting just to chew on something that there's a lot of\nphysical parts to it, but try to make it through\nthe first three weeks and do without breakfast\nor do without dinner and you'll get through it. And I did that most for\nmost of my life, actually, mainly because I wasn't\nhungry in the morning. Some people are very hungry in the morning and they may want to consider\nskipping dinner instead, but I will go throughout the whole day. I don't get the crashes\nof the high glucose and the low glucose that anyone who goes, oh man, it's three O'clock,\nI'm going to need a sleep. If you do what I do, you will not experience that anymore because what my body does is it regulates blood\nsugar levels naturally. My liver is putting out\nglucose when it needs to, and it's very steady\nand gives me pure focus throughout the day. And I don't have to even\nhave to think about lunch, I'm just powering through. At dinner, I mean, I love\nfood as much as anybody. So I will eat a regular,\npretty healthy meal. I'll try to eat mostly\nvegetables, I can eat some fish, some shrimp, I rarely will eat a steak. In fact, my microbiome is\nso adapted to my diet now, if I eat a steak, it will\nnot get digested very well. I'll feel terrible. - If I don't eat a steak, I feel terrible. [David laughs] - Argentine lineage, but\nwe can talk about that some other time. - Well, everybody's different,\nthat's the other thing. What works for me may\nnot be perfect for you and we do have to measure\nthings to know what's working. I rarely eat dessert, I\ngave up dessert and sugar when I turned 40 and occasionally I'll steal a bit of dessert 'cause it doesn't hurt\nif you steal it, right.? But other than that I avoid sugar, which includes simple carbohydrates,\nbread, I try to avoid, I've actually noticed,\nthis is just a side note. I used to get buildup\nof plaque pretty easily and every time I went to the dentist, they'd have to scrape it off. And I even bought tools to scrape it off. 'cause it was driving me nuts. I don't get pluck anymore and I think it's because of my diet. I don't have those sugars in my mouth that the bacteria feed on and then form the biofilm on the teeth. Much better breath, by the way. - That's a benefit. Should you ever fast longer than this. It sounds if you go to bed, well, you used to tend to stay up late. I know because I get texts from you at like two in the morning my time, which means you're out very\nlate and up early as well. But assuming that people go to sleep sometime around 1130 or\n12, plus or minus an hour and wake up sometime around 7:00 AM plus or minus 90 minutes,\nyou're eating more or less on. It sounds something like\na 20 hours of fasting, four hours of eating\nor 16 hours of fasting and eight hours of food intake, et cetera. But do you ever do longer fast, like 48 hours or 72\nhours a week long, fast? - Occasionally I do. So my typical day I would only\neat within a two hour window. Just usually I'm either eating out or. - 'Cause you're 22 too. - Yeah, but I love well. - And if you exercise,\ndo you feel like you, then you just power through\nand maintain that fasted state? - Absolutely, I can exercise and now I've already so used to it. I don't feel like I need food\nafter exercising, I used to. But have I gone longer? Yes, but not very often. I find it quite difficult\nto go more than 24 hours. But when I do it, maybe it's once a month, I'll go for two days after\ntwo and actually even better, if you go for three days without eating, it kicks in even greater\nlongevity benefits. So there's a system called\nthe autophagy system, which digests old and\nmisfolded proteins in the body. And there's a natural cleansing that happens when you're hungry. Macroautophagy its name is\nbut a good friend of mine, Ana Maria Cuervo at Albert\nEinstein College of Medicine discovered a deep cleanse called the chaperone mediated autophagy, which kicks in day two, day three, which really gets rid\nof the deep proteins. And what excites me is you\njust put out a big paper that said, if you trigger\nthis process in an old mouse, it lives 35% longer. - [Andrew] Wow. - Yeah, so it's a big deal. If I could go longer, I would. But I just find that with my lifestyle and I'm going always\nday, 110% I need to eat at least once a day unfortunately. - One more practical question\nthen a mechanistic question related to this, the practical question is when you are fasting,\nregardless of how long, I know you're ingesting fluids like water and presumably some caffeine\nI heard you had several or more espresso today,\nwhich is impressive, but are you also ingesting electrolytes? Like I know some people get lightheaded, they start to feel shaky when they fast. And that the addition\nof sodium to their water or potassium magnesium is something that's becoming a little more invoke now. Is that something that you do or that you see a need for people to do? - Well, it makes sense, but I\nhaven't had a need to do it. So I don't, I drink tea\nduring the day and coffee when I'm first awake and\nI don't get the shakes. So I don't fix what's not broken. And I do add things to my protocol that I think will improve\nme and avoid those things of course that wont. But yeah, because I\ndon't have a need for it, I don't try it. But it does make sense, especially if you've had a\nbig night the night before, you'd probably want to\nsupplement with that. But I think there's fair\namount of good stuff in tea and coffee as it is. - Okay, so then the\nmechanistic question is, you've told us that there's ample evidence that keeping your blood sugar\nlow for a period of time is 24 hours, can help\ntrigger some of these pro longevity anti-aging mechanisms. And that extending them\nout two or three days can trigger yet additional\nmechanisms of gobbling up of dead cells and things of that sort. How is it that blood glucose\ntriggers these mechanisms? Because we've said, okay, remove glucose and things get better. You've talked before maybe\nwe could talk more now about some of the underlying\ncellar and genetic mechanisms, things like this are sirtuins, but how our glucose in the sirtuins actually tethered to one\nanother mechanistically. - There's a really good question, that proves you're a scientist\nor a world-leading one. So what we've now know is\nthat these longevity pathways, we call them these longevity\ngenes, talk to each other. And we used to say, oh, my longevity genes is\nmore important than yours. It was ridiculous. 'Cause they're all talking to each other, you pull one lever and\nthe other one moves. And the way to think of it is\nthat there are systems set up to detect what you're eating. So the sirtuins will mainly\nrespond to sugar and insulin. And then there's this\nother system called mTOR, which is sensing how much\nprotein or amino acids are coming into your body. And they talk to each other, we can pull one and affect\nthe other and vice versa. But together when you're fasting, you'll get the sirtuin\nactivation, which is good for you. And you'll also through\nlack of amino acids, particularly three of them,\nleucine, lysine and valine. The body will down-regulate\nmTOR and it's that up sirtuin, down MTOR that is hugely beneficial and turns on all of the body's defenses, the pro chewing up the old proteins, improving insulin sensitivity,\ngiving us more energy, repairing cells, all of that. And so these two pathways, I think, are the most important for longevity. - So interesting, you mentioned leucine, within the resistance training\nslash body building slash fitness community. Leucine gets a lot of attention because there are long-standing debates about how much protein one needs per day and how much you want and\ncan assimilate at each meal. It makes for many YouTube videos\nand not much else, frankly. However, it's clear that\nbecause of leucine's effects on the mTOR pathway, that\nthere are many people, not just people in these\nparticular fitness communities that are actively trying\nto ingest more leucine on a regular basis in order\nto maximize their wellness and fitness and in some\ncases muscle growth but also just wellness. But what I interpret your\nlast statement to mean is that leucine, because\nit triggers seller growth is actually pro aging in\nsome sense, is that right? - Well, it could be that's\nwhat the evidence suggests. And again it goes back to the debate. Should you supplement with\ngrowth hormone or testosterone? All of these activities will\ngive you immediate benefits. You'll bulk up more. You'll feel better immediately, but based on the research, it's at the expense of long-term health. So my view of longevity, the way I treat my body is\nI don't burn both candles. I have one end of the candle lit, I'm very careful I don't blow on it, but I also do enough exercise that I'm building up my\nmuscle, but I'm not huge. Anyone who's seen me, knows that I'm not a\nprofessional bodybuilder, but I tried to actually, here's the key. And I haven't said this\npublicly, that I can remember. I pulse things so that\nI get periods of fasting and then I eat, then I take a supplement, then I fast, then I exercise and I'm taking the supplements and eating in the right timing to allow me to build up muscle sometimes because you can't just expect\nto take something constantly and do something\nconstantly for it to work. And that's why it's\ntaken me about 15 years to develop my protocol. And there's a lot of subtlety to it. - Yeah, it sounds like a\nvery rational protocol. Does the name Ori Hofmekler\nmean anything to you? - No. - Okay, just briefly, I\ndiscovered Ori Hofmekler about 15 years ago, he was\na in Israeli special forces. He's now got to be close to 70. Forgive me Ori, if that\nnumber is inflated. He wrote a book called 'The Warrior Diet', which got very little\nattention at the time. But what he said was when he\nwas in Israeli special forces, they rarely ate more than once per day. And sometimes once every\nsecond or third day. And this is a guy who maintains incredible physical stature,\nhe's very lean, very strong and very vital at, I\nwouldn't say an advanced age, but he's getting up there and he just seems to be\ngetting better and better. Ori Hofmekler was the person\nwho essentially founded, if you will, although\nour ancestors founded, to be completely fair, the so-called intermittent fasting diet. He called it the warrior diet and this book didn't get much attention. But one of the things that you just said really reminded me of Ori. I sat down with him, I\nactually went to his home and sat down with him and he\nsaid, fasting is wonderful but these pulses where\nyou nourish the body or even slightly over nourish the body provided they aren't too frequent, have a tremendous effect on vitality. And so I want to use\nthat as kind of a segue to address this issue of\nvitality versus longevity, because here you're telling me and certainly the evidence supports that growth hormone will make\nyou feel better and younger taking testosterone or estrogen,\nwe should probably say. There are women who take\nhormone therapies later in life who take estrogen, they experience a strong\nincrease in vitality if it's done correctly, but\nthere is an effect of aging, the body more rapidly, it's sort of a second puberty if you will, but this idea of restriction\nand then pulsing, not necessarily feast and famine, but certainly famine and\nfeast in lowercase letters, there really seems to\nbe something about that. So at a cellular level, we'd kind of go back to\nmTOR and the sirtuins. How do you think that the\ncells might be reacting to this kind of lowercased\nfeast and upper case famine type protocol? - Right, well, the pulsing, I\nthink is what you want to do is to get the cells to\nbe perceiving adversity. Okay, 'cause our modern\nlife we're sitting around, we're eating too much,\nwe're not exercising. Our cells respond. They go, hey, everything's\ncool, no problem. And they become relaxed and their own turn on their defenses and we age rapidly. We can see it in the clock. People who exercise and eat less, have a slower ticking clock, it's a fact. But my protocol is\ndifferent than most people's because I am pulsing it. Now, first of all, let's get to, why did I even think\nthat might be possible? 'Cause I didn't read the warrior diet. What I found in my research was that if we gave resveratrol on\nthis red wine molecule, that became well known in the 2000's. If we gave it to mice,\ntheir whole lifespan, they were protected\nagainst a high-fat diet, which we call the Western diet. They had lean organs. They live slightly longer, but not a lot. And if we gave them a high-fat\ndiet without resveratrol, they actually lived a lot shorter. So it resveratrol protected\nthem against the high-fat diet. We gave it to them on a normal diet, they just ate it when they wanted, and there wasn't much effect. This is what's not known though it's in a supplemental data of the paper that nobody ever reads. The mice that were given\nresveratrol every second day on a normal diet live dramatically longer than any other group. - [Andrew] Interesting. - So people out there, my\ncritics say, resveratrol didn't extend the lifespan\nof mice on a normal diet. Therefore it's not aging, it's just protecting\nagainst a high-fat diet. Well, look at the\nsupplemental data, please. If you give it to the\nmice every other day, we had mice living over three years. - Wow, that's a long time,\nI have got many, many mice in my owner ownership\nat my lab at Stanford and that's a very long life for a mouse. - It was, by far. And so it was a long life span extension. And what that told me is that probably, you don't want to be taking\na supplement every day. You can take it either every other day or give your body a rest. And I do the same with my meals, I rest during the day and then\nI give a nutritious dinner to my body and then give it\na rest, same with exercise. And then I try to time it\nbecause there are times when I'm taking the drug\nMetformin, which mimics low energy. For those of you who don't know, Metformin is a drug given\nto type two diabetics to bring down their blood sugar levels. But it's been found that\nlooking at tens of thousands of veterans and all those, that those two type two diabetics live longer than people that don't even get type two diabetes. So it's a longevity drug, right now you have to get it\nfrom your doctor in the US, in most of the countries\nyou can just get it over the counter and you protected. It looks like, based on\nepidemiological data, cancer, heart disease for LT. What else? Dementia. So I take Metformin. - In addition, you take Metformin end\nfast fasting each day. So when do you take it\nrelative to the fasting? - Yeah, I always take\nMetformin in the morning, along with the resveratrol,\nbecause for a number of reasons, but mainly because my body responds better and I've been measuring\nmy body for 12, 13 years. But here's the thing, if I'm\ngoing to exercise that day, I will skip the Metformin. And a lot of people who do pay attention to this kind of thing, think that they should\nstop taking Metformin 'cause they're never going to get muscle, or it's going to affect their\nability to build up muscle. But that's not true, what\nMetformin does to you, it actually just reduces\nyour ability to have stamina because it's inhibiting your\nbody's ability to make energy. And so what happens is\nwhen you're on Metformin, you do fewer reps. But guess what? Those muscles that you\ndo build up on Metformin, have the same strength and\nhave much lower inflammation and other markers of aging. You just won't have that\nextra 5% size of muscles. So if you want large muscles, don't take Metformin and you'll be fine during your exercise. But for me, I'm not trying to get giant. I want strong muscles\nand I want to live longer and healthier. So I just try to time it\nso that I get the most reps out of my exercise regime, but sometimes in scientific literature, it's worth bringing this up. If there's a 5% difference in a graph, then either the press release\nor some reporter will say, oh my goodness, big difference, 5% contact Metformin during exercise. That's the headline. And then you go in and\nit's barely significant. And the graph is distorted\nbecause they've changed the axes to make it look bigger. And now it's become a myth that Metformin greatly inhibits\nour ability to exercise, which is not true, but in\nan abundance of caution, I skipped my Metformin on\ndays I'm going exercise. And not only that, I'm one of the 20% of people that has a stomach sensitivity to it. So if I'm not feeling great that day, I don't take it either. - You mentioned Metformin is available only by prescription from a\ndoctor, at least in the US. Berberine is a substance\nthat comes from Tree Barco. I also learned about\nmany years ago from Ori. He said, if ever, I'm going to overeat like a Thanksgiving meal or something, I take berberine, those were his words. And I tried it and what's\nremarkable about berberine is that you can eat\nenormous quantities of food and not feel as if you've eaten\nenormous quantities of food. I'm not necessarily\nrecommending people do this. But what I noticed was\nif I took berberine, which my understanding is\nit works very similarly to Metformin where some\nof the AMPK pathway and the mTOR pathway, et cetera, that if I didn't ingest food\nin particular carbohydrates, I would feel a little dizzy\nand kind of get a headache, like almost hypoglycemic. What are your thoughts on berberine as an alternative to Metformin? And are there any cautionary notes? Obviously people should\ntalk to their doctor before adding or subtracting\nanything from their life, including breath order,\nanything that comes up, but with all of that set aside, what are your thoughts about berberine and timing of low blood sugar\nand these sorts of things? - Right, well, before I\nhad access to Metformin, I was taking berberine. It's often known as the\npoor man's Metformin. - He just called me poor. - Women can take it too. So the thing with berberine\nand we started it in my lab, it is effective at boosting\nenergetics in the body, just like AMPK and Metformin does. And we've actually given\nit to rats and mice and seen that they are very healthy, especially on a high-fat diet. So I think it's likely to be good. There are some human studies that exist, clinical trials showing that it increases insulin sensitivity. You have to take high doses. - Which is a good thing, right? I think when people hear\ninsulin sensitivity, sometimes people think,\noh, well that's bad, right? No, but you want your cells\nto be insulin sensitive. You don't want a lot of\nblood sugar floating around that can't be sequestered into cells. - Exactly, so this is\nanti type two diabetes. And so that this berberine\ndoes have wonderful effects on the metabolism of animals\nand in some clinical trials on dozens of people that's being tested. Now, there's one cautionary\ntale, which just came up, Caenorhabditis lab\npublished that berberine reduced the lifespan of worms, but I'm not sure worms\ntrump human clinical trials at this point. - Not in my opinion, no disrespect to my C. elegans colleagues or rather my colleagues that work on C. - Yeah, well, what I like to do is to give all the information, people can decide what they want, but I would say based on the worm data, I wouldn't panic just yet. And I think berberine has been shown to be really safe in humans. - You mentioned resveratrol, think now would be a great time\nto talk a little bit about, protocols for resveratrol,\ngreat seed extract, et cetera. Let's start with the obvious\none that I know you get a lot, but for the record, can't\nI just drink red wine and get enough resveratrol, David. - You can try, you need to\ndrink about 200 glasses a day. - I'm sure it's been tried. - There are some, and I drink\na glass of red wine a day if I get the chance,\nbut any more than that, it's a lot of calories and\nyour liver will get fatty and it's all bad. So, I mean, realistically, you can only get the thousand milligrams that I take a day from a\nsupplement that's pure. Now there are a lot of\npeople selling resveratrol. If it's not light gray or\nwhite in color, throw it away. The brown stuff has gone\nbad or is contaminated. And the contaminated stuff\nbeware it'll cause diarrhea. But regular resveratrol\nshould not do that. - So a thousand milligrams\nper day is what you do. - Yeah and I had for about 15 years now. And you ingest that with\nsome fatty substance, like olive oil or yogurt, is that right? - Yeah, you have to, and other supplements of course it's in curcumin. These are crunchy things, that is not going to get through your gut. And I'm not just making this up. I always base my statements\non human studies. So we've done a lot of\nstudies on resveratrol as have others since,\nand we know that from, we found out early, I was\none of the first people to take a high dose for resveratrol. And when we included it with food, the levels in my blood went up five fold. And so you want to have\nsomething in there. If you just drink it with water, it's not going to get through. And unfortunately, some people\nhave done clinical trials without even thinking that they might need to dissolve it in something. - So are you taking this\nall at once in the morning and chasing it with some olive oil or are you dissolving it in yogurt? What's the specific protocol? - Yeah, I've been improving perfecting what I do for about 10 years I would take some Greek yogurt, a couple of spoonfuls, put\nthe resveratrol on there, mix it around, make sure it's dissolved and put that in my mouth and swallow that, these days, what I like to do, because I've realized that olive oil and particularly oleic acid,\none of the mono unsaturated, fatty acids is also an activator\nof the sirtuin defenses. So I'm trying to ingest\nmore of oleic acid. So I switched to olive oil. What I do is I put a couple\nof teaspoons of olive oil in a glass mix around the resveratrol, and maybe some Coresatin\na similar molecule. Make sure it's dissolved. I put a little bit of vinegar and if I have a basil\nleaf, I'll put that in. And it's like drinking\nsome salad dressing. And it's very- - Delicious, that raises a\nquestion that I want to ask before we get to NMN\nand NR and vitamin B3, which is by doing that, do you think that it breaks your fast? And I want to just frame this\nquestion of breaking the fast in a more general scientific theme. And I'd love your thoughts on this. One of the questions I\nget asked all the time is does ingesting blank break the fast, does eating this or drinking this, coffee? If I walk in the room and\nsomeone else is eating a cracker, does it break my fast? People get pretty extreme with this, my sense and please tell me if I'm wrong, but my sense is that it\ndepends on the context of what you did the night before, whether or not you're\ndiabetic, lots of things. So for instance, if I eat an\nenormous meal at midnight, go to sleep, wake up at 6:00 AM. I could imagine that black coffee or coffee with a little bit\nof cream might quote unquote, break my fast, but the body doesn't have a breaking the fast switch. The body only speaks in the\nlanguage of glucose, AMPK, mTOR, et cetera. So do you worry that\ningesting these calories is going to quote unquote break your fast? And more generally, how do you think about the\nissue of whether or not you're fasting enough to\nget these positive effects? Because not everybody can manage\non just water or just tea, or we should say not\neverybody is willing to manage on just water or just tea for\na certain part of the day. - Well, my first answer is not scientific, it's philosophical. If you don't enjoy life, what's the point. And so I'd like a cup of\ncoffee in the morning, a little bit of milk, spoonful of yogurt, it's not going to kill me. Olive oil doesn't have protein\nor carbs in it, not many. And so I'm probably not affecting those longevity pathways\nnegatively, but without that, first of all, I wouldn't\nenjoy my life as much. Second, well, the olive\noil isn't is not as great as the yogurt, but I'm trying to optimize and there's no perfect\nsolution to what we're doing. And we're still learning. We don't know what's optimal for me, let alone everybody else. But I'm with you, I don't believe that taking a couple of spoonfuls of something, unless it's high fructose corn\nsyrup is going to hurt you because I've now got the rest of the day till about eight, 9:00 PM\nof not eating anything. And that I forgive myself for that. And that there's a really good point here. You and I were discussing this earlier. The point about doing this is\nthat you try to do your best. If you go from regular living\nto donate the whole day, you're going to fail. It's like quitting smoking, cold turkey. It's easy to chew gum\nand stick the patch on because your body has to get\nused to all sorts of habits. And it's social, it's physical,\nputting stuff in your mouth, chewing, not just the\nlow blood sugar levels and your brain will fight it. Your limbic system is going to go, hey, do it, do it, do it. And you're going to have to fight it but once you get through\nit, you'll be better, but you do it in stages. Do breakfast first, then do small lunch and then eventually cut lunch out. Don't go cold turkey\nbecause everyone knows. It's a fact that if you\ntry to do a strict diet right out of the gates,\nthey'll almost always fail. - Now, I think that captures the essence of the fasting rationally\nand irrational approach to supplementation very well, along the lines of supplementation. What about NMN, NR and B3, niacin? How does one, I want to know what you do. I also want to know what I should do, and I think most people want\nto know what they should do. These are molecules that\nimpact the sirtuin pathway impact the pathways that control aging or rates of aging in the epigenome. How do they do that? And how does one incorporate that into a supplementation protocol? Should they choose to do that? All right. - Well, disclaimer is I\ndon't recommend anything, but I talk about what I do. So a bit of scientific background, these are two in genes that we discovered first in yeast cells when I was at MIT and then in animals as I\nmoved to Harvard in the 2000's one of my first post-docs, actually literally my\nfirst postdoc Haim Cohen, published a great paper\njust a couple of months ago and found that turning\non the sirtuin six gene, middle of the seven, number\nsix gene is very potent. It extended the lifespan\ndramatically of mice that he engineered both males\nand females, which is great. So what you want to do\nis so naturally boost the activity of these sirtuins. They are genes, but\nthey also make proteins. That's what genes\ntypically make or encode. And then those proteins\ntake care of the body in many different ways as we've discussed. So how do you turn on these\ngenes and make the proteins they make even more active? You want to rev up that system. So exercise will do\nit, fasting will do it. What about supplementation? Well, the first activator of\nthe sirtuins that we discovered that acts on the enzyme\nto make it do a better job of cleaning up the body\nand protecting resveratrol We looked at thousands\nof different molecules, eventually tens of thousands. And the one that was the best\nwas resveratrol in the dish. And then we gave it to\nlittle organisms, worms, and then flies and\nmice, eventually humans. And we saw that it activated that enzyme. So resveratrol is one way to activate it. And you can think of it as the\naccelerator pedal on a car. It revs it up, but there's\nsomething else that the sirtuins need to work and that's NAD\nand is a really small molecule, little chemical in the\nbody that we need for life. It's used by the body\nfor chemical reactions, for a hundred different\nreactions in the body. And without it, you're dead\nwithin seconds, you need NAD. The problem that we've\nseen is that NAD levels decline as you become\nobese, as you get older, if you don't ever get hungry and the body not only doesn't make enough of it, it's chewing it up as well. There's an enzyme called\nCD38 that Eric Verdin over at UCSF showed choose up. Now he's now at the Buck\nInstitute in California, choose up NAD as you get older. So it's a double whammy. You don't make as much and chew it up, which is really bad because\nwhat we've shown in my lab and so have others is that NAD levels are really important for keeping\nthose sirtuins and defenses at a useful level. And you can give a lot of resveratrol but if you don't have the fuel, you're basically accelerating a car that doesn't have enough gas. So you want to do both. And that's what I do. I take a precursor to NAD called\nNMN and the body uses that to make the NAD molecule in one step. And so I know from measuring\ndozens of human beings, that if you take NMN for\nthe time period that I do, I've been taking it for years. But if you take it for about two weeks, you'll double on average, double your NAD levels in the blood. Okay, that's not public information. That's from clinical trials\nthat are not yet published over the last two years. There are other ways\nto increase NAD levels in someone like me, who's\ngetting older, I'm 52 now. You can take NR, which\nis used to make an amend, which is used to make\nNAD, and both NMN and NR are sold by companies in the US. NR is laxter phosphate, the phosphate is a small\nchemical the body needs. You've probably heard\nof the atom, phosphorus. Let's go back one step. How do you make NR? NR gets made from vitamin B3, often. You can also find it in\nmilk and other foods, but sometimes people ask me, why don't you just take vitamin B3? And won't that just force\nthe body to make NAD? And the answer is no, it\ndoesn't work very well. We know this just by doing the experiment, but the reason I think is is that NAD, I said, it's a small molecule, but relative to vitamin B3, it's big. It's got those phosphates\non there, it's got a sugar, it's got the vitamin B attached. So you've got all these\ncomponents that come together to make this very complicated\nlittle molecule called NAD. When you give NMN, it\ncontains all three components that the body needs to make NAD. If you give NR or just vitamin B3, which is an even smaller molecule, the body has to find\nthese other components from somewhere else. So where do you get phosphate, well, the body needs it for\nDNA, it needs it for bones. So high doses of something that requires additional phosphate makes me a little concerned. And we have compared to\nNMN and NR head-to-head in mouse studies, for instance in NMN, we've shown in a cell\npaper a few years ago, makes mice run further, old\nmice can run 50% further 'cause they had better\nblood flow, better energy. NR are at the same dose, did not do that. In fact, it had no effect. - I see, dosage wise, if\nI were elect to take NMN in supplement form to\nincrease my NAD levels and presumably slow my aging, how much NMN should I take? What's the protocol that you do? And are the various\nforms that are out there, are some better or some worse? - Well, I'm always happy\nto tell you what I do and what my father does,\nmy 82-year-old father, we take a gram of NMN every day. - So it's a gram resveratrol\nand a gram of NMN. - Right. - Okay a thousand milligrams. - Now another important point, which is, I'm not the\nsame as everybody else. I have a different\nmicrobiome, age, sex, right? And so I've been measuring myself and so I know if something's, or I think I know if\nsomething's making me better or worse based on measuring\n45 different things. So I just want people to be aware that what I do may not perfectly\nor work at all for others, but I have studied, as I said, dozens of people who take NMN, at a gram, sometimes two grams. And I know by looking at all those people that without any exceptions,\nthat if you do what I do, your NAD levels go up by\nabout two fold or more. And so I do that every day,\nthe thousand milligrams. Now people sell it. Now I never get into brands and all that. First of all, I don't have\nthe time to measure products. I don't know, though I should say, I do want to say I'm working on a solution for people to know what works and what's real and what\nisn't, but I'm not there yet. And in the meantime, I would say, if you do want to buy this,\nlet's say you want to buy NMN, look for a company that\nis well-established that has high levels of quality control. Look for three letters, GMP, which is good manufacturing practices. And so that means they make\nit under a certain level of quality control. You're not going to find\niron filings in there and it probably has the stuff\nin it that they say it does. But so that's all I can say right now. I'm working on something that's\ngoing to be much more helpful, but overall, make sure it's\nwhite, crystalline NMN, and that to me, it tastes\nlike burnt popcorn. - You crack open the capsules, and you'll take a little sample to make sure it tastes like burnt popcorn. - Well, when I'm making\nmy capsules, I'll taste it and I do a lot of quality\ncontrol on the stuff that I take. - Do you take that gram all at once with the resveratrol or do you take it spread\nthroughout the day? - It's all in the\nmorning for those things. So if I take Metformin, it's NMN and the resveratrol altogether. And there's a good reason for that. It's all scientific, I try to be. The levels of NAD go up in the morning in our bodies naturally. Our bodies actually have a\ncycle of NAD, it's not steady. - It's Arcadian? - It's Acadian. In fact, NAD controls your clock. This was shown by Shin Imai and colleagues in this nice science\npaper about a decade ago, that if you disrupt the NAD cycle, which is controlled by the\nsirtuin gene that we worked on, that is what's telling your\nbody, oh, it's time to eat, it's time to go to sleep. And if you take these, the NMN\nlate at night, for example, you can disrupt your circadian rhythms. - Interesting. - Conversely, when I travel\nand I want to reset my clock to the time zone, I will take\na boost of NMN in the morning and I feel great. - Does this protocol for you, does it produce any immediate effects of increased energy, et cetera? You mentioned that one would,\nif it's right for them, would have to take it\nfor at least two weeks to start to see the NAD levels increase. At that point, when NAD levels increase, could one possibly expect an increase in overall energy, focus, et cetera? I realize we're not making promises here, but I'm just wondering whether\nor not the only measure of whether or not this protocol is working is whether or not you die at\nage blank or blank plus 20. And of course, once you're dead, you can't really know if\nyou would've lived longer if you'd done something\ndifferently and vice versa. - Sure, well, there was a\nstudy again by Shin Imai my good friend at Washington\nUniversity in St. Louis that showed that improves, remember this insulin sensitivity,\nwhich is a good thing. But you can't know your\ninsulin sensitivity unless you're measuring glucose, have a glucose monitor on your arm. - Do you have one on right now? - No, no, I used to, I learned a lot. - Yeah, last time I\nsaw you had this thing, it looks like a small leach, not a large leach and it was\nmeasuring your blood glucose. - They're very informative\nbecause you learn what your body reacts to\nand grapes were really bad. Rhonda Patrick agrees with\nthat, but the issue was, was what, where were we, Andrew? - The issue is whether\nor not you can expect any immediate effects on\nenergy, vitality, focus, just even subject. - So what do you feel, is the question. And anecdotally, 'cause I've been taking\nthis for a long time, if I don't take it, I\nstart to feel 50 years old, it's horrible. I can't think straight. It may be placebo, but who knows? But what we're doing now are\nvery careful clinical trials. We've done the safety for two years, and we're now treating elderly patients at Harvard Medical School with\nsome wonderful colleagues. And those people are actually going to be an currently in MRIs. So you can measure the\nenergetics and the NAD levels in their legs as they\nexercise in real time. And that will tell us if\nwhat we see in the mice is increased endurance actually works. In the meantime, it's fun\nto talk about anecdotes. I have a number of athlete friends, some of which have increased their load, their time in marathons, for example. There's a good friend\nof ours in our circle that is winning marathons at age 50 now. And he attributes that to\nthe protocol that he's on. - Interesting, I haven't\nstarted taking NMN, but I'm planning to do that\nwhen my next birthday arrives, which is in a couple months. But I do experiments on my\nsister and have for years, I have a sister who's three\nyears older than I am, who is very enthusiastic\nabout these protocols. And I'll tell you that\nafter reading your book, I started purchasing\nfor her and giving her an NMN supplement and she\nclaims and I believe her. She has a quite sensitive system and she's very tuned into it. She feels far and away\nbetter when she takes it, as opposed to when she doesn't and I've done the control\nexperiment of removing her supply, and then giving it back to\nher in this kind of thing. So that's my other laboratory. This is what younger brothers\ndo to their older sisters. I have a question about something that if it has no relevance, we can just treat it as a speed\nbump and then move right on. And the artificial sweeteners, these things that we\nshould say non-glucose, increasing sweetener. So you've got Stevia,\nwhich is a plant basically. And then you've got\nsucralose and aspartame and all these things. There is some evidence that\nI know we're both aware of, they've been publishing\nquite reputable journals, showing that they can\ndisrupt the gut microbiome in certain cases in particular saccharin, the one that basically\nnobody uses anymore. And it's questionable as\nto whether or not Stevia has the same negative effects, et cetera. That's not what this is about, but in terms of the sensation of, or the perception of sweet taste, is that itself a possible detriment to these pro-longevity,\nforgive me for using the term, the pathways. If I were to drink a\ndiet coke during a fast, am I somehow disrupting this? And I'm asking this question, because I get asked this question a lot. - Well, there may be small effects. I don't think they're\nworth worrying about. Joe Rogan laughed at me 'cause\nI was drinking a diet coke during the first\ninterview I did with them. I will drink diet coke, I've\nread the scientific literature. And again, it's this 5% thing that I think is blowing out of proportion. If I was to put a number\non it, I would say, if eating a high sugary meal or drinking a sugar-filled soda, what is that, 30 grams of sugar? Let's say that's a 10\nout of 10 bad for you. A diet coke might be a one. And if I'm, which am I going to do? I could have a 10 or a one\nor go without in my life. I'll do the one on occasion. I try to avoid them because I\ndon't like the ones as much. But you can't say that sucralose is equivalent to drinking a sugary soda. There's just no comparison. And I think suc, what is it? Stevia, I do use Stevia whenever I can, because it's a naturally sourced product. And I haven't seen any good evidence yet that it's bad for you. But I think a lot of this is overblown, and a lot of it's the media trying to give equal weight to stories\nas you know as a scientist. It can be frustrating\nwhen something's a 10 and something's a one,\nand they're equated. - How do I say this respectfully? I think if science\njournalists were required to post their credentials\nalongside their name, [chuckles] then people would take the articles into, with additional grain of salt, right? I mean, in other words, that I think that the science media is mainly generated\naround two specific goals. One is to make people very, very afraid or get people very, very excited, and oftentimes the get people excited part is sponsored content, and I think that's overlooked in any case. Thank you for that. I want to talk about iron and iron load. We were talking earlier about ferritin. And of course, women menstruate. And so their iron needs\nare greater than people, men that don't menstruate or women that don't menstruate. I don't think we can get right down into how much iron somebody needs because it'll vary person to person. But I was surprised to learn that iron is actually going to accelerate the aging process in various contexts. - Well, this is a new\nfinding out of Spain. Manuel Serrano's lab has\nfound that excess iron will increase the number of\nsenescent cells in the body. And senescent cells are these zombie cells that accumulate as you get\nolder and they sit there and they cause inflammation mainly and also can cause cancer. And it's found that if\nyou get rid of these cells or never accumulate\nthem, you stay younger. In animals, and there's some\nreally interesting studies out of Mayo Clinic in humans as well. So iron is a pro-senescent metal. And so what I think is that if you're taking\nexcess iron as a supplement, you're probably accelerating\nyour aging process. The other thing that I\nfound really interesting is I've looked at hundreds of thousands of people's metabolism and\ntheir blood biomarkers. I was one of the first people in InsideTracker as a board member, and I'm still their scientific lead guy. So I can look anonymously at hundreds of thousands\nof people's blood work. And we also know how fit\nthey are, how old they are. Some of them are marathon runners, some of them are CrossFit. And there's a signature of health that actually is different\nthan your average person. Now, I'm not going to\nsay bad things about MDs 'cause a lot of my best friends are MDs and I work with them at\nHarvard Medical School. The issue though, is\nthat with MD training, there's a scale of what's normal, and if you're out of that normal range, something must be wrong, that's the paradigm that they work under. But first of all, everybody's different, and you want to know their baseline and track people over years to\nknow what's normal for them. And what I find for example, is people who are really\nhealthy and live the way I do and have a diet that's fairly\nvegetarian, but not strict, still have slightly low hemoglobin levels, slightly low iron, slightly low ferritin, but we have super amounts\nof energy, we're not anemic. And we're getting along great in life. But a doctor who just\nlooks at that might say, oh, we need to give you more iron. All right, so what I'm\ngetting at is an example of, we need to personalize medicine and look at people over the long run to know what works for them\nand what's healthy for them, and not just work towards\nthe average human, but work towards what's optimal for human. - I love that answer. You mentioned tracking\nand tracking over time. And this is a really interesting area that I know you have been\nfocused on for a long time. I've been getting blood worked\non about every six months frankly, since I was in college. I just got, I like data and I got interested in\nsupplementation and exercise 'cause it made me feel better, but I also want to know what\nwas going on under the hood. So you get numbers back, you\nget this hormone, that hormone, this blood glucose measure, et cetera. How do you make sense of the data? I mean, what InsideTracker is doing aside, how do you personally\nmake sense of the data in ways that might differ from the way that a standard MD might\nlook at one of these charts? Because the standard practice is to say, is it red, yellow, or green, right? Is it basically too high or too low? Is it somewhere close to\nthe margins or are you okay? Are you in these ranges? Are there any things\nthat you pay attention to that you think are\nparticularly interesting for people to just take note of? I mean, we're not asking you to go against anybody's physician. But what sorts of things\nshould people start to educate themselves about in terms of what these\nmolecules are on their charts if they choose to get them,\nand what do you look at? - Yeah, well, there's a lot there. The first is that you\nshould be tracking things, because one measurement isn't enough. These things vary and over time. And if you can have a\ndecade or more of data, it's super important, informative, as you know, well know, as you know. So the physician, interestingly, my physician, let's\ntake him as an example. So he sees me, he says,\n\"How are you feeling?\" \"I'm feeling great.\" \"Okay, see you next\nyear,\" that's craziness. Anyway, so I say, okay, stop. Let's talk a little bit about. - Let me educate you, that's\nwhat David tells his physician. I imagine that the\n12-year-old David Sinclair says to a physician, \"Listen, let's have a\ndifferent discussion.\" Is that how it works?\n- It is. He finds me pretty annoying\nas does my dentist. But so I say, so hang\non, I've got this data. I've got the InsideTracker data. So I pull that up on the screen, and I'm showing him the\nchanges in my cholesterol and my CRP, which is\ninflammatory marker as you know. And we're going through it, and you can see things change over time, and I've corrected them as they go slightly out of\nthe optimal range for me, which is different than\nwhat he would do, of course. But what was funny is that he says, this is great, I love this data. But I'm not allowed to get\nthis because of course, the insurance companies won't pay for it. So again, you can pay out of pocket. It's not super expensive. I would say, if you save a\nbit of money on a coffee, you can afford this kind of stuff. But the main point is that\ndoctors do like this data. It's just that they're\nunable to spend the money on every one of their patients to get it. - Is there a code word that someone can use with their physician that will trigger a\ncomprehensive blood test? I keep trying to figure\nout what's the code that one needs to ask\nor tell their doctor, I'm feeling blank so that\nthey get a full blood panel. - Well. - Do you have to be hemorrhaging\nfrom the gut or something? - Well, I usually use the WTH method, which is what the hell? And then he says, \"Okay, we'll do it.\" - 'Cause I think a lot of\npeople out there are thinking, look, I'd love to have blood\nwork repeatedly over time, but that's hard to get\nfor financial reasons, but also a lot of people\njust don't know how to approach the conversation. And this is one of the things that I hope that we can educate people on, that they deserve to know what's\ngoing on inside their body, and that it makes a\ndoctor's visit worthwhile, and that you don't have to\nfeign illness in order to do it. - Right, yeah, and a lot of people do. So I would say, if you\ncan't afford these tests, there are increasing number of companies that offer these tests,\nInsideTracker is one of them. And you just do it a couple\nof times a year at a minimum. And then you can share\nthat with your doctor. If you can't afford that, then\nI would say to your doctor, here are the main ones\nthat Andrew and David do. - Yep, and we must. And there's an email that is something like 555, or a phone number, rather, it's 555-5555. I think if they have any complaints, they can just call that number. David will pick up on the\neast coast business hours and I'll pick up outside of those hours. - But there was the\nmain ones, I would say. Your blood sugar levels,\nyou want to do your HbA1c, which is your average glucose\nlevels over the month. There's CRP, which I\nmentioned for inflammation. - Yeah, let's talk about\nC-reactive protein for a second. 'Cause I think it's been shown to be an early marker\nof macular degeneration of heart disease, of a\nvariety of different things. CRP is something that we don't hear enough about, I think. Maybe, what do you know\nabout CRP that I don't, I'm guessing a lot, but. - Oh, it was originally picked up as something that was\nassociated with heart disease in the Framingham study, I believe. It is the best marker for\ncardiovascular inflammation and is also, we use it as\na predictor of longevity, and its levels go up with mortality. And so this is an association, but there's enough data that I would say, if you have high levels of CRP, you need to get your levels down quickly. And the levels usually go up with age and with levels of inflammation. So the ways to get it down\nwould be to switch the diet, eat less, try to eat more vegetables. You'll find it will come down, and there are also drugs that can do it. Anti-inflammatories can do it as well. But CRP is, it's actually, hCRP, there's a high sensitive\nhCRP, your doctor will know. Get one of those readings. 'Cause if you've got\nnormal blood sugar levels, your doctor, or fasting\nblood sugar levels, your doctor might say you're fine. But a lot of people\nhave normal blood sugar, but have high CRP, which is\njust as bad for you longterm, and can predict a future heart attack. - On the lines of heart attack. I want your thoughts on cholesterol and serum cholesterol\nand dietary cholesterol. I cannot, for the life of me, get my arms around this literature. And even if I ignore all\nthe essentially nonsense that's out there in various\nsocial media groups, as saying cholesterol is the\nworst thing in the world, or cholesterol is not, or dietary cholesterol has nothing to do with serum cholesterol and\nnothing to do with longevity. I can't seem to sort\nthrough the very basic data that essentially ask, is having high levels of LDL\ngoing to kill me earlier? Should I be striving to always\nreduce LDL and increase HDL? Is that a reasonable goal? And if so, is dietary cholesterol the\nprimary determinant of that? And just as a final point about this, I am aware of quite good data\nthat shows that anorexics, people that essentially eat no food, unless you force them to,\ncan often have very high LDL. So their dietary cholesterol\nis essentially zero, and so they're manufacturing\na lot of their own. So realize this isn't your\nprimary area of expertise, but you're a smart guy and you think about this\nkind of stuff a lot. What do you think is going on with the cholesterol literature? And will we ever get to the bottom of this as a scientific and medical community? Because to me, it is rather perplexing. - It is, but you can get\nthrough the politics. I know a fair bit about cholesterol 'cause it's in my family history. And I was headed for an early death, my grandmother had a stroke 30, that's how bad I am in\nterms of my genetics. So I went on a statin, and I\nknow there's a lot of people who say that statins long-term are bad. It's associated with Alzheimer's disease. I've been taking a statins since I was 29. And that's 'cause I forced my same doctor to give me the statin, the conversation was something like this. You're too young to be on a statin. And I said, what? You want me to have a heart attack before you give me\nsomething, give it to me now. So 29, I'd been on a satin, and my cholesterol was\nway up in beyond 300, which is a massive mess up. Basically my blood was creamy to look at. So I've now got my cholesterol down to low, low levels to what would it be. You can check on my InsideTracker, but so my ratio of HDL to LDL, which you want to be less\nthan five, is now two, and the LDL is below a\nhundred, so it's all good. And I've measured my\ncardiovascular health with an MRI. I've got a movie of my heart beating. I've still got a heart of a\n20-year old, so that's working, I'm willing to forgo the risk that the statin is causing problems later because of my family history. But other people, I would say, be aware that statins\naren't perfect drugs. There were some interesting new ones. There's one called the PCSK9 inhibitor, which is, I think fortnightly,\nevery two weeks injection, that blocks the release\nof LDL from the liver. And then that seems to be\ngreat for lowering cholesterol, but also has other benefits\nthat might be prolongevity. And there were some people that I was just talking to\non the cutting edge of this, and their doctors are\ntrying them on this drug instead of the statin. So you could talk to your doctor about. - Do you avoid dietary\ncholesterol for that reason also? Red meat, butter. I mean, I have been to love butter. I love red meat. I realized there's some people who don't. My cholesterol is a little bit high, but I'm working to bring that down a bit, although not by altering\nmy food intake yet. But what do you think is the relationship between dietary cholesterol\nand serum cholesterol, and what's going on with the liver? Why are anorexics? Why is there a certain cholesterol so high when they're eating nothing? - Well, there've been in a\nnumber of papers over the years that have been ignored. And our friend, Peter Attia, brought to my attention recently, a new study that I think definitively said that dietary cholesterol\nhas almost zero impact on blood cholesterol levels. - Good. - Yeah, so I'm annoyed\n'cause I'd been avoiding eggs and butter for most of my\nlife and I didn't have to. So I have eggs- - Plenty of time, or\nat least in your case. - Yeah, yeah. So that's the thing. You can eat these foods\nthat were ones banned because it's very difficult to take cholesterol up\ninto the body from the gut. And most of it's being\nsynthesized in the body. - Well, I'm just pausing\nthere for a second because I think that it's\nwhat we've been told. Six meals a day, eat a\nlot of grains and fruits and this kind of thing, avoid cholesterol. I mean, basically everything we learned in the '80s and '90s and early 2000s is getting flipped on its head now. But, and I think this\nis a very strong caveat that's important to mention, amino acids. In particular, the amino acids that come from animal products, right? Seem to have some pro aging\neffect on them, right? At least the way that I've\nheard you describe your diet. And I'm somebody who\nenjoys meat, I like it. But so I'm by no means, a vegan at all. But I've heard you say\nyou eat mostly plants, but a little bit of fish or chicken or something\nof that sort of eggs or. But is that specifically to avoid excessive amino acid intake? Or is it something specific about plants that excites you with\nrespect to? [chuckles] I mean, vegetables are\ndelicious too, but what is it? Is it something great about plants or is it something bad\nabout when I think of meat, I guess the biologist in me\nthinks amino acids, right? I don't think top sirloin,\nI think amino acids. And I think top sirloin as I'm eating it, but really what they are, are amino acids, including leucine. - Yeah, well, there are two\ngood things about plants, and neither of them is taste for me. I would eat steak all the time if I could. I did when I was a kid, I'm an Australian. But plants have two benefits. One is that they're highly nutritious, and they'll give you a lot of the vitamins and nutrients that I need. I don't take multivitamin, I don't want to have the\nexcess iron in my body. So there's that high density nutrition. So those dark leaves, if\nit's a spinach salad, great. The second is that there is what's called xenohormetic\nmolecules in plants. That term, xenohormesis is a term that I came up with\nwith my friend, Conrad. How it's, which means\nstressed plants make molecules that benefit your health. I'll break it down. Xeno means between species,\nand hormesis is the term, whatever doesn't kill\nyou makes you stronger and live longer. And the idea is that when\nplants are stressed out, think of a great vine that's dried out and then starting to harvest the grapes, which is typically how it's done. They are full with resveratrol, because resveratrol is\na plant defense molecule that I think is made to activate those\nsirtuin genes in a plant. So plants have sirtuins just like we do. But by purifying or at least concentrating in a light-proof bottle and\nkeeping it out of the air, we stabilize the xenohormetic molecule, or it's a cocktail, not just\none, there's others in wine. We then ingest those and get the benefits of activating our own defenses, because our food was getting stressed out. And by stressed, I don't mean\npsychologically stressed. I mean, biologically stressed. And so I try to eat plants that have gone through a bit of stress. They might be brightly colored,\nthey've had too much sun or got nibbled on by a caterpillar. So you go to places where it's\norganic or it's fresh, local, and those are the plants\nthat aren't perfect, and they probably have high concentrations of these molecules. And in addition, I also\nbuy the supplements to make sure I'm getting\nenough of those as well. - Which supplements mimic that? - So resveratrol will, there's another one called quercetin, or quercetin, some people call it, what you find in trace\namounts in apples and onions. And we also showed back in 2003 that it activates sirtuins as well. But others have, 20 years later, found that it kills senescent cells or helps kill senescent cells. So it's a double whammy\nwith that molecule. - And are you actively\npicking out the peaches that look like they were\nnibbled on by a caterpillar? - No, but I don't worry if\nthey've been banged up a bit. - What's the story with antioxidants? Are they of any value whatsoever, because the way that you\ndescribe them at the beginning, and what I've heard recently is that they are not all\nthe rage for anti-aging. What are they doing that's useful? Should we be seeking\nout antioxidants anyway for other seller health purposes? - Well, yeah, antioxidants\nare not going to hurt you unless you take mega doses. We do need some oxidants\nfor our immune system. And there's even, what's\ncalled mitohormesis, which is your mitochondria power packs, need to have a little bit\nof these free radicals to be able to function. So you don't want to overdose\non these antioxidants, vitamin C, vitamin E, don't overdo it. - You don't take a multivitamin, correct? - Right. - I think I'm going to stop\nafter this conversation 'cause I've always just taken one for the kind of insurance purpose, which is a stupid purpose. Not actual insurance, but just thinking, oh cap top off on my ACBD. - Right, and I'll pee out what\nI don't need, right, sure. - But that never bothered me. The whole expensive pee thing never got. That argument never got\nmade because of that. A good vitamin is not that expensive. I just figured better safe than sorry, but it may be that it's detrimental. - Well, it can in the case of iron as we discussed and the antioxidants. So when I came into the aging\nfield in the early 1990s, it was all about antioxidants. And we thought that enzymes\nby the name of catalyze and superoxide dismutase, well, they're going to be the key to longevity. It turns out that it's\nlargely been a failure that giving animals and\nhumans antioxidants, haven't had the longevity\nbenefits that we dreamed of. And the main reason is that\nthere's a lot more going on than just free radical damage. The epigenome gets disrupted, we've got these proteins misfolding. And so the problem really has\nbeen that we didn't realize that you need to turn on the body's natural defenses against that plus a whole host of other\nthings to get the true benefits. But I'm not going to say\nit's a problem taking it, an antioxidant drink, pomegranate juice for one\nis full of good stuff, including xenohormetic molecules. But resveratrol is a good case in point, which is when I worked on resveratrol as a longevity molecule, first we showed it in yeast\nand worms and flies and mice. Before that, it was\nthought that resveratrol was good for your heart in red\nwine when you drink red wine, because it's an antioxidant. So then we showed that\nit extended the lifespan of yeast cells through this\ngenetic pathway, the sirtuins. And we then tested whether resveratrol, if we change one atom to make it not an antioxidant, guess what? It still worked fine. So it wasn't its anti-oxidant activity that was extending lifespan. It was its ability to turn on the yeast's defenses against aging. Conversely, when we gave\nthe yeast antioxidants, they lived shorter. So yeah, that was the\nbeginning of my transformation into thinking turn on the body's defenses, don't give it the antioxidants. - This is an opportunity\nfor me to say something that I've been wanting\nto say for a long time, which is that, what's so\nwonderful about science is that because the goal is mechanism, you can really start to understand as you just described, what\nactually mediates a process is very different than\nwhat modulates a process. I mean, if a fire alarm goes\noff in the building right now, it's going to modulate our attention. That doesn't mean that it\ncontrols our attention, it's not mechanistically relevant. And so I think this\nthing about antioxidants is one of these cases, it sounds like where it's\nin the right ballpark, but until one really unveils\nthe mechanism as you have, you can be, one can or in a field, can be badly wrong for a\nvery long period of time. It sounds like the sirtuins and really getting down to\nthe guts of the machinery of what causes cells to age\nis really what it's about. Zooming way out, what\nare the behavioral tools that one can start to think about in terms of ways to modulate these? Basically the way that DNA is being expressed and functioning. I've heard you talk before about hormesis of other\nsorts, cold exposure. We talked about fasting. We talked about exercise in broad terms, but what about any evidence, if it exists, as to whether or not aerobic training versus weight training,\nthese sorts of things. In other words, what\nare the sorts of things that people can do to improve\ntheir sirtuin pathway? And I realized that there are caveats. We can't go directly from\na behavior dissertations, but in the general theme, what can people do, what do you do? - Right, well, we know\nthat that aerobic exercise in mice and rats raises their NAD levels and their levels of sirt,\none of the genes goes up two actually, number one and number three. What we don't know yet\nis what type of exercise is optimal to get them to change. We will learn, we're doing work. Now it's revealed that we're doing work with the military in the US, to try and understand that kind of thing. And I'll always tell you and the public, when I don't know something\nI'm not going to extrapolate. But what do I do? I base my exercise on the\nscientific literature, which has shown that\nmaintaining muscle mass is very important for a number of reasons. The two main ones are, you want to maintain your hormone levels. I'm an older male, losing my testosterone\nand muscle mass over time. And by exercising, I will\nmaintain that and have, in fact, I probably haven't\nhad a body like this since I was 20. So that's one of the benefits\nof having this lifestyle. - Sorry to interrupt you. You do know we did an episode on hormones and there are data in humans that show that there are some\nmales in their '80s and '90s where their testosterone is equivalent to the average of 25 and 30-year-olds. I can get you that information, is really impressive studies. Unfortunately, they didn't\ninclude a lot of information about the lifestyle factors, et cetera. But this idea that testosterone\ngoes down with age, it might be the trend, but it's not necessarily a prerequisite. - Right, I believe in naturally increasing and maintaining these hormone levels and I've been measuring\nthem for a long time. And I could see for me,\nmy testosterone levels were steadily, levels were going down. - And then you got tenure\nand they went back up again. [both chuckle] - No, I actually became complacent. And it was the worst. Actually my age changed in the\nwrong direction after that, 'cause I was relaxed. - Interesting. - And not worried about the future. But then I got serious. And I actually, according to\nthe InsideTracker algorithm, got my age down from 58 to\n31 in a matter of months. So that was a big drop. And I've been getting steadily younger over the last 10 years, according to that\nmeasurement, the blood test. - What about estrogen? Because women are different in the sense that they do the number of eggs that they, and the ovaries change over time, right? Do you think that they can\nmaintain estrogen levels in over longer periods of time using some of these same protocols? - Well, yeah, I get into trouble\nfrom a certain university when I talk about this too much. - About estrogen? - Just about fertility and long story. I don't want to get too\nmuch into the anecdotes, but I'll tell you the science, which is that if you take a\nmouse and put it on fasting or caloric restriction\nfor up until the point where it should be in fertile, so that's about at a year of age, a mouse gets infertile, female mouse. - Due to fasting or\ndue to simply to aging? - Due to aging, due to aging. The fasting, it's not extreme fast, it's just less calories. Then you put them back on a regular food, and they become fertile again for many, many months afterwards. So the effect on slowing down aging is also on the reproductive system. - Interesting. - And so that, I wouldn't\nsay to any woman, I wouldn't think that they\nshould become super skinny to try and preserve fertility,\nthat's not what I'm saying. But these pathways that we work on these, sirtuins are known to delay\ninfertility in female animals. Case in point, I'm one of the lead authors on a paper where we used NMN. Remember, this is the gas, the fuel, the petrol for the sirtuins. We gave old mice. One group of mice was 16 months old. Remember they became infertile\nat 12, gave them NMN. And I think it was only six weeks later, they had offspring. They became fertile again, which goes against biology,\nthe textbook biology, which is that female\nmammals run out of eggs. Turns out that's not true. You can rejuvenate the\nfemale reproductive system, and even get them to\ncome out of mouseopause as we call it. So that's a whole new\nparadigm in biology as well. - That's super interesting. Sorry to interrupt you, but I'm reminded by a set of studies that were done by your former colleagues 'cause they're no longer there, David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel, my scientific great grandparents. Won the Nobel prize for discovering, what are called critical periods, this phase of early development when the brain is extremely plastic. And a big part of their work was to show that after a certain point, the critical period shuts down, essentially the brain can't\nchange or not nearly as much. And then people came\nalong later and showed that you could open up these\ncritical periods again, but very briefly, and it takes a very specific\nstimulus, essentially, high degrees of focus, et cetera. However, there's a well-known\nphenomenon in this literature where if you take an\nanimal and to some degree, this has been shown in humans as well, and you let them pass\nthrough the critical period, but then you essentially\nsensory deprive them. You take away experience,\nyou close both eyes. You essentially reopen\nthe critical period. So it seems like I couldn't\nhelp but mention this, that there's this parallel between what we're talking\nabout here with fertility and neuroplasticity, where yes, there is a timer where\ncertain things are available to the organism early in life, and then they tend to taper off. It's not an open and\nshut, but they taper off. But then a deprivation\ncan actually reactivate the availability of that process. Forgive me, I just couldn't\nhelp him mention it, but to me, so both of those things\nare associated with youth, fertility and neuroplasticity. And so I think that\nit'd be so interesting. I'd love to collaborate with you on this to explore how neuroplasticity\nmight actually be regulated by these things like the sirtuins. - Right, and the sirtuins\ndo control memory in neurons as well. So what I think is really interesting is that what we're learning from work that you and your colleagues have done and in my lab as well, is that the body has\nremarkable powers of healing and recovering from illness and injury. And what we once thought\nwas a one-way street and you just can't repair, or you can't get over these diseases, you can reset the system, and the body can really get rejuvenated in ways that in the future will wonder, why didn't we work on this earlier? The future of humanity is more like us walking\naround like Deadpool. We'll probably be cleaner, and we won't smell as badly, but Deadpool, if you don't know, can get injured and just recover. It's very hard to injure this guy, and we're going to be the same. There are many species\nyou cut off the limb, the limb grows back. - Salamanders or. - Yeah. We are now learning how\nto tap into that system. And in part, what we're doing is reversing the age of those cells, and telling them how to read\nthe genes correctly again, reversing the age of that epigenome. And when you do that, the cells, the brain, for instance, the skin. We did the optic nerve. - Let's talk about those\nresults for a second. Then I want to make sure that we return to some of these behavioral protocols. You have this amazing paper\nat the end of last year, cover article, full article in nature, showing that essentially a small menu of transcription factors, which control gene expression, et cetera, could essentially reverse\nthe age of neurons in the eye and rescue those cells against damage. Essentially allow blind mice to see again, and offset degeneration\nof these retinal cells, incredible paper, and\nsuch a boom to the field. Where does that stand now in\nterms of human clinical trials? I mean, how do, what are you envisioning in terms of the trajectory of those data from mice into human someday? - Right, well, to get to\nthe point immediately, we're going to be testing\nthe treatment on monkeys, just for safety reasons. And then the first patient\nshould be done sometime in 2022, early 2023, and we're going\nto try to recover blindness. - This involves making an injection of a virus into the eye, right? Right now, there's no\nway that I am aware of to manipulate these transcription factors through a pill or some other? - And that's why, we working on in my lab at Harvard right now. So it will be- - It will base moderation of- - Well you pop a pill in the whole body gets rejuvenated by 20 years. That's what we're aiming for. Now we do it with gene therapy\nin the eye and other places. So in the IES, it's single injection, the genes go into the retina\nand we can turn it on, with a drug called doxycycline. And we do that in the mice\nfor four to eight weeks, then the eye gets younger. We can measure that' cause\nyou can measure the clock. And then the vision\ncomes back in those mice. And I don't see any reason,\nwhy it shouldn't work in people because it's the same structures\nand mechanisms that are on in the human as well. Now these- - And it's one injection. - It's one. - I should mention injections into the eye obviously nobody should do this outside of a ophthalmology clinic. And there definitely by\nan ophthalmologist but, the injections into the eye\nare painless if done correctly by the right person. It sounds dreadful, but it's actually, I've seen it done hundreds of times. I've done it, thousands of times and it's not to myself,\nbut to other creatures. And there's a way of doing this as completely painless to the person- - Oh you don't feel it. It's a tiny, tiny needle too. But the great thing about this is that it's a one-time treatment. Those genes go into the back\nof the eye and stay there, forever. And you can just turn\nthem on whenever you want. So what we found is you can\nturn them on in the mice, they get their vision back, and then you turn it off again. And so far, many months out, the benefit has remained, but if it does decline, we'll just turn it back\non and reset the system, rinse and repeat. So one day what's exciting is that we could potentially do\nthis across the entire body and just take this antibiotic, every five years and go\nback time and time again. - And thinking about the body and what's going on under\nthe head I'm amazed, still that there isn't a\nsimple, affordable technology that would allow me to just\nlook into my body and see whether or not there are\nany tumors growing anywhere. I mean, it's not that hard\nto look into the body. I mean that the technology exists. why hasn't anybody created an at home or pseudo at home solution,\nlike a clinic where you can go and pay 50 bucks or a hundred bucks and see if you have any\ntumors growing anymore. - Yeah, it's still expensive. You can get your doctor\nto try to get you in, there's some companies\nthat offer blood tests that look at circulating DNA, that'll measure it. We're getting there. It's still probably five to 10 years away from being really cheap. You can do things like a\ncolon cancer test at home. I think it's a hundred\nand something dollars. You ship off your shit,\nexcuse my language, and they measure it. And they tell you if\nyou've got colon cancer, with high probability, I did that during the pandemic because I didn't want\nto get a colonoscopy. - Mhmh, is it more accurate or\nas accurate as a colonoscopy? - I believe it's close\nto being as accurate. The downside is that during a colonoscopy, they can pinch off the polyps\nthat are looking dangerous, whereas this obviously isn't that, but it's certainly easier to do. And my father who's\nAustralian tells me that it's free for Australians. They get this test routinely. - Mhmh, interesting. I want to return to the topic\nthat I took us away from. So I apologize, which\nis behavioral protocols. Do you regularly do the cold shower thing? Ice baths, cold water swims,\nare you into that whole biz? [David chuckles] - Well, you do know that\nI've done it at least once 'cause we did it together. - That's right. Not the same bath, just to be very clear, same sauna, different ice baths, [David chuckles] the idea of Sinclair and Huberman taking an\nice bath together it's a, it might warm some people's hearts, but just to be very clear, different, same ice bath, different, different times. - Yeah, thank you for clarifying. - [Andrew] Yeah. I don't do them regularly. I do try to sleep cool. I sleep better anyway. I try to dress without\na lot of warm clothes. I'm here in a T-shirt and\nit's middle of summer, but in winter, I'll try\nto wear a T-shirt too. - So you're challenging your\nsystem to thermoregulate? - Right, right. I've got this, hypothesis with Ray Cronise. We published what's called The\nMetabolic Winter Hypothesis, which is, few tens of\nthousands of years ago, we were either hungry or cold or both and we really experience that now. And so, we try to give\nourselves the metabolic winter and part of the problem I\nthink with the obesity epidemic is that we're never cold and cold, when you're cold you have to burn energy. It may be only slightly,\nbut over the whole night, if you're a little bit cool, you'll actually expend more energy. So I try to do that, but I'm not a big fan of cold showers. The sauna, I don't have access\nto my gym as much as I did. So, but I do want to get back into it. I used to do it regularly with my son and I posted on Instagram once that he could stay in there for 15 minutes and I could only stay in for about three. Anyway, long story short, I try to compensate with\nchanges in my diet and exercise until I get back into it. - You reminded me of something\nthat I meant to ask earlier that obesity reduces NAD\nlevels and accelerates aging. How? I mean, okay. So again, this is the, the scientist in the us, so someone's carrying a lot\nof excess adipose tissues, subcutaneous and, visceral fat. But why should that reduce NAD in any ways that are independent of\neffects on glucose and insulin? If it, you know, is there's something direct\nabout white adipose tissue. And the reason I ask this, is not simply to dig into mechanism alone, but I think there are\nreally interesting data now that fat actually gets neural innervation. I mean, it's not just a, it's not just stored fuel. It's stored fuel, that's acting as an\nendocrine organ, essentially. So, why would being fat\nmake people age faster? - Yeah, that's a question that, is so obvious, but so few people ask it, that's what makes you a good scientist. And so that we don't know, but I'll give you my best\nanswer, which is that, obesity comes along with\na lot of problems that, include a lot of senescent cells in fat, if you stain old fat for\nsenescent cells, it lights up. - Mhmh. And when you kill off those cells, at least in mice, and maybe in humans, it looks like the fat is\nless toxic to the body. 'Cause those senescent cells\nin their fat are secreting these inflammatory molecules that will accelerate aging as we now know. We talk about the sirtuins in NAD. So if we, if we just look philosophically, at why this would be the sirtuins only, like to come on or get\nactivated when the body needs, is on the right adversity. And if a cell is surrounded by\nfat or contains a lot of fat, it's going to think times a good, it doesn't need to switch on. So that's the evolutionary argument. Mechanistically, we don't know, but it could have something to do with the response to glucose, which then responds to the sirtuin gene, but that hasn't been worked out very well. - And is there any evidence that leptin, this hormone from fat can actually, interact with the sirtuin pathway? - I don't recall seeing that- - Maybe I could do a\nsabbatical in your lab and that'd be a fun one. - Definitely- - Because leptin during\ndevelopment is what triggers, the permission for the hypothalamus\nto enter puberty, right? - Yeah. - This is why kids that eat\na lot when they're young and get overweight will also start to go and undergo puberty more quickly, although they have\nreproductive issues later. - Well yeah. We should study the\nhypothalamus together 'cause, the hypothalamus is, can control the aging of the body. - The most interesting part of the brain. [Andrew chuckles] - For sure. - Yeah, absolutely. - If you turn on the SIRT1 gene, the SIRT2 that we work\non, in the hypothalamus that actually, will extend lifespan. Also, it's been shown by Dongsheng Cai at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, that if you, inhibit\ninflammation in the hypothalamus, in a mouse, it will increase or maintain the expression\nof what's called GnRH, which is the hormone that, he found actually controls\nlongevity in the mouse in part. And so keeping inflammation\ndown in the hypothalamus, is sufficient to extend\nthe life span of animals. And I reviewed that paper for nature all about seven years ago. And that was the first demonstration that the hypothalamus is one\nof the leading regulators of the body's age. - I find this fascinating GnRH, for those of you that don't\nknow actually comes from neurons in the hypothalamus that then, literally reached down into the pituitary and trigger the release of\nall the things that control fertility, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera. It's such a powerful set of neurons, and it's never really been clear, what at a behavioral level\ntriggers the release of GnRH. There's all the stories about pheromones and timers and puberty, et cetera, but environmental conditions\nand dietary conditions and behaviors that can\ncontrol GnRH release, I think, is an incredible area for exploration. I'd love to do that sabbatical by the way. I have a couple, well\nseemingly random questions, but I can't help, but ask\nbecause one thing I like to do is forage the internet for\npractices that at least more than a few people are doing, and then wonder whether or\nnot there's any basis for it. You mentioned methylation\nas a detrimental process, the way it disrupts the\nepigenome and the CD reader, so to speak. There are people out there who\nare ingesting methylene blue. And when I was a kid, I used methylene blue\nto clean my fish tank. And I love fish tanks. I know you're into aquaria also, a different podcast episode,\nwe'll talk about aquaria, but why in the world, would\npeople ingest methylene blue? Meaning is their logic correct? And or is that a dangerous practice? I'm not sure I'd want to\ningest methylene blue, sounds not like a bad thing to do. - It stains your body if you've\nseen, yeah methylene blue- - Yeah, there was someone\nin my lab as a postdoc was using it to study a\ncompletely different process related to the blood-brain barrier and used to inject into animals\nand they would turn blue, but then again, people\ningest colloid silver. You know they'll put\nin there, there's this, please people don't do this or if you do, just don't tell me, 'cause I won't like it. They, people put it in their eyes and some people actually stain their skin. They actually become kind of\na silver purple brown color if they do it excessively. I mean, there's a lot of\ncrazy stuff out there. But what do you think they're thinking with this methylene blue thing or should we just get them\nto a good psychiatrist? - I don't know, for sure. I think methylene blue was found to extend the lifespan\nof some lower organism and that's where it came from. My recollection- - With the emphasis on lower organisms. - Yes smaller organisms. I think doesn't, do you\nremember Andrew does it, interrupt or interfere\nwith mitochondrial activity and that's- - Maybe that's why the are doing it. - Yeah.\n- [Andrew] Okay. - We need to look this up and post it. - [Andrew] Okay. - We'll get to the bottom\nof this, but those methods, let's talk about those. - [Andrew] Yeah. - Those methods have to\nbe placed on the right, part of the genome. They get attached to the right\ngenes in the wrong genes. And if you have a lot of methylation, it's going to mess up the epigenome. Smoking will do that, lack of\nexercise, all that good stuff. So you, what you actually want\nto do is you want to measure it and make sure what you're\ndoing with your body, is working. How do you know that if you do this or that is actually helping. And so you can test your age. I could take, a swab from your mouth and tell you how old you are biologically. And then we could work on\ntrying to bring that down and actually there were anecdotes now, that people are reversing\ntheir age by a decade or more just by doing some of the\nthings that we've talked about and some other cutting edge stuff that I'm going to write about. But yet, but you have to measure stuff. That's, I didn't want to\nforget to bring that up. I'm measuring stuff all the time. I have blood tests like you, I've got this monitor that\nstuck to my chest right now that's measuring myself\na thousand times a second and I measure my biological age. - What's it measuring a\nthousand times a second? A huge list of things. - Yeah, yeah. So this, this little device is stuck here and it's for two weeks\nthat you just recharge it or send it back and get a new one. It's got a body temperature movement, heart rate variability. It's an FDA approved\ndevice, it's not a toy. It's not one of these recreational things. It also listens to my voice, eventually will me if\nI need a psychiatrist or if I'm depressed, it will tell me how I sleep, obviously. But when you put all that data together and it's individualized and anonymized, it can now tell my doctor in real time, if I've got a cold that\nneeds an antibiotic, or it's just a virus. If I am suffering from COVID-19 or even if I'm going to have\na heart attack next week. And so these little devices\nare going to be with us all the time, instead of going\nto your doctor once a year, which is ludicrous. - I have to ask you about x-rays. 'Cause every time I go through\nthe scanner at the airport, I think, \"Sinclair would never do this.\" And the argument I heard\nyou give about this before was a really excellent one, which is that it's a low level amount of radiation, going through at the airport, but the argument is always, well, it's just as much as on the plane and your argument, your\ncounter-argument I should say was, \"Well then why would I\nwant to do both, right? Why would?\" So when you go to the airport, assuming you're not running late and you have to go\nthrough the standard line, what do you say to them? And do you say, \"I'm David Sinclair.\" And then they shuttle\nyou to your own line. What do you say? You do say, \"I don't like this thing.\" Do you have to give them a reason? - No, you don't. You can say, \"I don't want this.\" And they'll get annoyed\n'cause it's hard for them to pat you down, but you get a pat down and you you're done as long as you're not\nin a hurry, it's fine. If you want to pay for\nthe TSA Pre in America or the way to get around those\nscanners, you can do that. So I travel a lot, so\nit's worth it anyway, but I just go through the metal detector, I don't get scanned. - And the metal detector\ndoesn't have the same, same problem. And what about x-rays at the dentist? Yeah. - Well, you know one x-ray\nis not going to kill you. Two's not going to kill you, but I- - Three will kill you. No, I'm just kidding. [Andrew chuckles] - I try to limit it\nbecause it's cumulative. - Right. - And I went for six years\nwithout having a dental x-ray and then my last visit, I just gave up. I was tired of arguing with my dentist. So they gave me one, but they've got led coats on and they put lead all over your body. That's telling you something right there. And funnily enough, my\nteeth hadn't changed. Now you can balance that by saying, \"Well, one x-ray, two x-ray, three x-rays is worth\nit if I have cavities.\" And that's true, you want to know what's in there, but doing it regularly, for me, I don't think it was worth it because it, my teeth are in perfect\nhealth and I've always been, I don't have any cavities,\ndidn't have braces, they're fine. So stop scanning me. I mean, I know you have\nto pay for the machine, but you know, do I have a choice? Yes, so stop pressuring me. - You know, who shared your\nsentiments about x-rays and the dentist in general? My apologies to the dentists out there, was the great physicist, Richard Feynman. This is a story about him that's\nnot especially well-known, but he had very serious\nconcerns, health concerns, about x-rays because he\nunderstood the physics and he understood enough biology that, he was actually quite vocal about his, dislike of dental\ntechnology and its dangers. And he talked about some of that. People can find that on\nthe internet, if they like. Speaking of people who, are like Feynman, who've been engaged in public\ndiscourse about science. One of the things that I\nappreciate about you, in fact, the way that you and I, initially came to know one\nanother is through your public health education efforts. So, obviously we're doing this podcast, you've done the Joe Rogan Podcast, Lex Fridman's Podcast, excuse me Lex, I'm still adjusting that. Lex Fridman's Podcast\nand many other podcasts, you've written an amazing book. What are you thinking these days in terms of what the\nworld needs in terms of, education from scientists,\neducation from MDs, education in general as it\nrelates to these things because, I think if nothing else\n2020 revealed to us that there's a gap, there's a gap in understanding. And that the scientists too are guilty of, not knowing what to do\nwith all the information that's out there on pub med or elsewhere. I'm just, you know, what are you thinking for\nyourself and in general, I'd like to just know, what do you think the world needs there? Maybe we can recruit some\nmore public educators. - Yeah. Well, we've gone from a\ntime, when you and I were, in college and young\nprofessors where the only way, to get our voice out to\nthe public was either through a newspaper or a\nvery short radio interview, which for me was extremely\nfrustrating 'cause particularly the newspapers and my topic, every time was twisted into something that was not just embarrassing,\nbut Harvard university used to bring me into the back office and- - Frankenstein. - \"How did you say such a thing? We're all going to live to a 250.\" I didn't say that. So, we're now also in a world where we're overwhelmed with information, and most of it is wrong and anyone can pretend to be an expert. So we've gone from early\ndays to now the future, and we're experiencing it right now thanks to guys like you, people like you, is that the experts, some experts, a small number who are\nbrilliant and good communicators are talking directly to the public. This has never been able to be possible, until this time, right now. So another five years from\nnow, and certainly by 10 years, I would hope that there are\ntrusted sources of information of people who can not just\ncommunicate, the ideas directly, but are able to talk about\nthings that are going on that aren't even published yet to say, \"Here's what's really going on. And this is what the future looks like.\" But this is somebody, like yourself who spent their whole life\nstudying a particular topic and knows what they're talking about. And this, this is also something\nthat I think most people don't know that we\nscientists, if we tell a lie, we burst into flames, we absolutely cannot tell\nsomething, that's untrue. And to the best of our\nknowledge, we say it as it is, because if we don't, we're beaten up, and we, or we kicked\nout of the university. So the people who survive to our age, and I'm a little older than you. So I've survived a bit longer. - But a lot younger inside. [Andrew chuckles] - Nah, but we have to measure you with- - Yeah we need, I probably need a little\nhelp, hopefully not too much. - We'll measure that, and we'll work on your\neating, but this is really, really important is that, finally people like your are\nallowed by our universities to talk to the public. I used to do it, with a real threat to my survival. People would look at me, \"Oh, he's a salesman, he's\npromoting this and that.\" It was seen as a real\nnegative, but finally, I think we're in a world where, it's not negative anymore. And the pandemic showed that\nwe needed voices of reason, voices of fact, that you could trust. And you can see the\npopularity of your podcast, shows that the public, they're desperate for\nfacts that they can trust, 'cause they don't know\nwhat to believe anymore. - Well, I'm being completely honest\nwhen I say this, that, you know, I followed your lead. I saw you on the Joe Rogan\nPodcast and my jaw dropped. I was like, \"This is amazing, like this.\" Because, you get out other good\nscientists on before but, you're tenure Professor Harvard Genetics, Department of Genetics. And for those of you don't know, there's the Harvard and of\ncourse, Harvard Medical School and they're both excellent, of course, but these are the top,\ntop tiers of academia. And I certainly understand\nwhat it takes to get there and survive there and to thrive there, it's like a game of pinball. You never win. You just, you just get to, if you're doing really well,\nyou get to keep playing. And that's the truth in academia. And if you're not, you\nstop playing basically. But when I saw you,\nexplain what you were doing in a way that was accessible to people and also talking about, possible protocols that they\nmight explore for themselves to see if those were, right for them. I was just, I was just\ndazzled and excited, and I made every effort to\nget in contact with you. And, the rest is history, but, I think what's really\nexciting to me these days is because of 2020 and with\neverything that's happened and it continues to happen. There's a thirst for knowledge. There's also this direct\nto the public route that you mentioned. And, I think there's also an openness, I'd love your thoughts on this, but it seems to me that\nthere's an openness in, from the general public, about health practices, that there are actually things\nthat people can do to control their stress level, to control, their sleep, to control their cholesterol if that's what they to\ndo, maybe they don't and to even control their lifespan, which I think is remarkable. And, I know I speak on\nbehalf of so many people, when I just, I want to say, thank you. You've, truly changed\nthe course of my life. I would not be sitting here doing this were it not for your example. And I always say Sinclair,\nmany people have written books, many academics have\nwritten books, as you have, but in terms of doing podcasts and really getting out there\nwith your message in a way that I have to assume raised\nyour cortisol level and heart rate just a little bit, but you did it nonetheless. You are truly first man in and that, that deserves a nod. And, I have a great debt of\ngratitude to you for that. So thank you so much. - Oh thanks, Andrew. You're a, you've become a good friend and I'm super proud of what\nyou've done and what you, I know what you will do. - So in addition to your book and your presence on social\nmedia, Instagram, and Twitter, and appearances on podcasts, recently I've noticed\nthat you've opened up, a survey email/website\nthat people can, access, excuse me, to get some information\nabout their own health and rates of aging. Tell us about that and\nwhat's being measured. And what is this test that\nyou've been working on, secretly and now soon, not so secretly. - Yeah, well that, what I want, is a credit score for\nthe body to make it easy for people to follow their health. And there is a number, there's a, there's a biological age\nthat you can measure. Unfortunately, the test is many hundreds\nof dollars right now, but in my lab, we've been\nable to bring that down a lot. And so I want to democratize this test so that everybody has access to a score for their health that can predict their, not just their future\nhealth and time of death, but to change it. And I'm building a system\nthat will point people in the right direction and give them discounts for certain things that will improve, not\njust their health now, but 10, 20, 30 years into the future. And we can measure that, and very cheaply, keep\nmeasuring it to know that you're on the right track, 'cause if you don't measure something, you can't optimize it. And so this is the biological age test, we've developed it, it's\na simple mouth swab. We're rolling it out. We're building the system right now. And there was a sign up sheet 'cause a lot of people\nwant to get in line, go to doctorsinclair.com, you can get on that and you'll be one of the\nfirst people in the world to get this test and see what we're doing. - Oh, fantastic. Will people be celebrating their, biological age birthdays? In other words, if I'm\nminus, like if I can imagine, so I'm 45 right now, soon to be 46. But if I, if I were to be so lucky as\nto get my biological age to 35 within 12 months, maybe\nyou can help me do that. Do I get to celebrate, a negative birthday? - Absolutely. And my plan is that those\npeople who take their age back a year or more, we think we can\ngo back 20 years eventually, they'll get a birthday card from me and it's a negative birthday card. [Andrew chuckles] - I love it. And probably very little, actual birthday cake being ingested but, who cares 'cause you're\nliving that much longer. - That's full of stevia,* that'll be fine. [Both chuckle] And thank you for talking to us today. I realized I took us down deep\ninto the guts of mechanism and as well, talking\nabout global protocols, everything from what one can\ndo and take if they choose, that's right for them to, how to think about this\nwhole process that, that we talk about when\nwe talk about lifespan as always an incredibly illuminating. Thank you, David. - Thanks Andrew. - Thank you for joining\nme for my conversation with Dr David Sinclair.

It's hubermanlab on Instagram. I also have a Twitter\nwhich has also hubermanlab. So be sure to check those out. A lot of the material, covers things similar to the podcast, but oftentimes I'll\ncover a unique material, not featured at all on the podcast. So that's hubermanlab on\nInstagram and on Twitter. In addition, we have a Patreon, it's patreon.com/andrewhuberman. And there you can support the podcast at any level that you like. Today, and in many other\nprevious episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss supplements. While supplements aren't\nnecessary or right for everybody, many people derive tremendous\nbenefit from supplements. For that reason, we partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E, because Thorne Supplements are the absolute highest quality and the absolute highest precision, meaning what you see listed on the bottle is what's actually in the bottle, which is not the case for many supplement companies out there. Thorne is one of the\npartners of the Mayo Clinic and all the major sports teams. And so they really are very\ntrusted, very highest quality. If you want to see the supplements\nthat I personally take, you can go to thorne.com/u/huberman, and there you'll see the\nsupplements that I take, you can get 20% off any\nof those supplements. And if you navigate deeper\ninto the Thorne site, through that portal, you'll also get 20% off any\nof the other supplements that Thorne makes. So again, it's Thorne, thorne.com/u/huberman to get 20% off any of the\nsupplements that Thorne makes. Also take note that the\nlifespan podcast featuring Dr David Sinclair as a host, launches Wednesday, January 5th, you can find the first episode here on the Huberman Lab Podcast channel. They also have their\nown independent channel. You can find the link to that\nchannel in the show notes. So please go there, subscribe on YouTube, also on Apple and Spotify. I've seen these episodes,\nthey are phenomenal, and you're going to learn\na tremendous amount, about aging and how to\nslow and reverse aging from the world expert\nhimself, Dr David Sinclair. And last, but certainly not least, thank you for your interest in science. [upbeat music]"
