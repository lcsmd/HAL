        "transcript": "in this video I'm going to explain what is the difference between Microsoft co-pilot Studio versus what used to be power virtual agents so let's first start with what is power virtual agents and power virtual agents was a Microsoft Power Platform uh application or Studio that would allow you to build your own custom virtual agents that would allow you to say be able to do like call center deflection scenarios and things of this nature and so if we start with the understanding that that is what power virtual agents was it was the ability to create new bespoke uh implementations of conversational agents then we can start to explore what is Microsoft co-pilot studio so now the question you may be asking yourself is what is Microsoft co-pilot Studio well Microsoft co-pilot Studio does include the capabilities to be able to create your own custom co-pilot or custom uh virtual agent as well that's why it displaces power virtual agents as a Microsoft product but let's uh explore this a little more so not only can you build your own co-pilot within Microsoft co-pilot Studio but it is actually opening up the doors to do more than just building uh co-pilots it also is going to be the platform that you use across Microsoft to extend all the different co-pilots that Microsoft is offering now not all co-pilots today can be extended but as they start offering extensibility within those different co-pilot such as the M365 co-pilot you will see that this is going to open up the way that you can build these plugins for extensibility and make them available to those different uh Solutions and you'll see that uh this is going to be packaged as part of those co-pilots as the extensibility play so that you don't necessarily have to go by Microsoft co-pilot studio if you're looking to extend an existing Microsoft co-pilot it will just be available to you to be able to do that now if we look at I want to create my own custom co-pilot it's going to require that you go and license it um through the messages that are available and it's sold in message packs of 25,000 messages so just be aware that this is the difference a lot of people think that uh Microsoft co-pilot studio and uh PVA are the same thing and they're actually not because what was traditionally power virtual agents was a subset of the capability of copilot studio and as we kind of look at this slide here you can see that Microsoft co-pilot Studio becomes that extensibility uh point for all of the different um Microsoft platforms and different co-pilots that are out there now co-pilot Studio itself is built on top of uh a lot of different Azure Services um but not only can we extend these co-pilots using this co-pilot Studio but we can actually also build our own custom co-pilots as well so hopefully this helps you understand the difference between the two there's been a lot of questions about why you would use uh co-pilot Studio there's also a lot of confusion about M365 co-pilot so if you think about the M365 co-pilot those co-pilots from Microsoft that are are really branded for like M365 co-pilot or sales co-pilot or or co-pilot for service what these things are is they are experiences that have their own canvases and they are built for specific purposes so if you would like to add some custom Solutions or custom capabilities to those existing Solutions this is the way that you would do it with Microsoft co-pilot Studio but be aware that M365 co-pilot for example is a personal productivity co-pilot it wasn't intended to be something different and it will populate in canvases such as PowerPoint inside of teams inside of Windows and things like that if you're looking to build a a co-pilot of your own that you're in full control of it and you want to be able to put it into multiple channels say you want to put it in teams you want to put it on your website or things of that nature then that is a custom co-pilot that you will build with uh Microsoft co-pilot studio so I hope this helps to make you understand the difference between these and always feel free to subscribe uh to my Channel please let me know in the comments below if you would have a suggestion for anything that you would like for me to uh show you guys also you can always go and try this out by going to aka.ms SLT TR copilot Studio I hope this was super helpful"
