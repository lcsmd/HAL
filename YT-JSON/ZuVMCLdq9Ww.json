        "transcript": "Donald Trump a former president was back in court today this time the former president is answering for his business dealings in New York and his Empire might be at stake the self-described property Mogul has already been found liable for persistent and repeated fraud in this Civil Trial according to documents David K Johnston is a pet surprise winning economic economics reporter and he joins har strovas to discuss what this means for the Trump organization Christian thanks David k Johnson thanks so much for joining us uh last week a judge found that the president the former president of the United States persistently committed fraud as he built up his Empire of businesses in New York just kind of if you could for people who might not have been paying attention to exactly what happened last week walk us through what the judge said is there well the issue had to do with the values Trump placed on some of his businesses principally real estate and real estate is is a range of value you don't know what your house will sell for tomorrow but if you have a house you think's worth a quarter million dollars it's not going to sell for $200 million and Trump valued some of these properties at more than 10 times what a already generous appraisal had shown they were worth and he's been doing this for the whole 35 years that I've known him making claims like this and finally it's become a legal issue okay and and for those of us who aren't fam amiliar with how that translates into the rest of the business Empire inflating the value of say your Penthouse and how big it is or how much it's worth what is the advantage you get from that well it allowed Trump to get larger loans on better terms because it appeared to the banks that their risk level was lower because the share of the value that was represented by the loan was smaller and even though the banks all got paid back this time the fact is that me other people didn't get loans that they might have because Banks all have a limited lending capacity right now how big of a decision is this oh this is incredibly damaging to Donald Trump uh and it goes to the heart of who he is Donald is his money and he's always saying he has more money than he has once he told me he was worth $3 billion do I told him I didn't believe him and so said him that later that afternoon he told another journalist he was worth $5 billion he just makes this stuff up and this is the first time he's ever been held to account for it I mean in a large way the case that he made when he was running the first time was that I'm a successful businessman I've built this Empire and I can do the same for the country that's exactly his case here's the problems with it uh he's not a successful businessman uh as laid out in the his book The Art of the deal what he does is rip people off and then move on to the next victim and it's very clear if you read the book that that's what he does uh he has a long history of not paying his workers not paying vendors employing illegal aliens and refusing to pay them until they threatened to kill his supervisor um so Trump's whole life has been a facade and I admire his incredible skill at telling people and persuading people he's what he isn't so what happens now well this trial is only about the damages due to the state of New York the judge last week cancelled Donald Trump's business certificates business licenses he cannot do business now in New York there's a monitor watching the companies he can't take money out of them to support himself eventually when the amount due is set the businesses will be sold and all of the Trump organization Enterprises and more than 500 of them have to be divested because if you don't have a business license you cannot run a business unless like me as a book author you're a sole proprietor the judge in this case will appoint a receiver at some point there will certainly be appeals and arguments about that but because Donald no longer has business licenses in New York the receiver will accept all of the property he will put it up for sale uh just as happens in bankruptcy though this is State business law the sale prices are going to be much more fire sale prices than premium prices the uh creditors get paid first uh people have mortgages on the building or um second the government including the fines Trump below when the state is seeking $250 million in penalties and the person who gets paid last Donald Trump so could the children still profit from this no now that two of his sons are named in this uh litigation along with the Trump organization and Donald's eyes wide openen blind trust that he created when he became president and all of those are covered by this now Ivanka Trump got herself out of the case and the two younger children uh are not involved in it whatsoever so Donald is he's out of business in New York and well we're going to see a lot of litigation this will be a Full Employment Program for lawyers uh at the end of the day Donald Trump will not have his his Enterprises and his businesses and he may well lose Mara Lago was that also inflated in value oh yes in fact one of Donald's complaints is that it's worth hundreds of millions of dollars one of his sons was on the internet saying exactly that the judge says yeah it's worth around $118 million remember Mar Lago is a business uh it has hotel rooms they hold weddings and other functions there it's not a personal home so he can't Shield it uh from this action by the government but all of his property will have to be liquidated and it will be done by the courta appointed receiver and the person who gets paid last is Donal and given the inflated values you may not up with much if anything so couldn't Trump say look I am not an accountant I trusted everybody around me um you should take it up with uh Mr weiselberg you should take it up with lots of other things and frankly you should call the banks because they're the ones that approved my inflated numbers if that's what you're finding right if if shouldn't the banks have some responsibility here well well absolutely and it's a good example of the very poor job we do of regulating banks in America I mean in recent years we found one of the six too big to fail Banks created millions of fraudulent accounts and all they did was pay some fines and go on we're doing a very very bad job of regulating Banks and Bank regulation goes all the way back to hamar Robb's code 4,000 years ago uh as for Donald trying to blame other people he always does that I mean Donald was asked in the 2016 campaign Mr Trump you you're a Christian when was the last time you asked God for forgiveness and he said ask God for forgiveness why would I do that I've never done anything in my life that requires asking forgiveness Donald never assumes responsibility he always blames other people and there are people who are gullible enough to believe that but in a court of law arguments that may win you votes are not what's it issue the law is about fraud are very clear very well-developed and the evidence against Donald in this case is overwhelming and all you have to do is read the judge's opinion don't need to be a lawyer to understand it and he lays out very clearly this was calculated intentional fraud and as some of his Executives used to tell me and as Michael Cohen has said to me and to everybody else nothing happens in the Trump organization without the direction and approval of Mr Trump his uh Trump's lawyer uh Christopher ke said he will appeal the decision he called it quote completely disconnected from the facts and governing law and Trump said it was a political persecution W has kind of threw the potential appeals process for Donald Trump well in this civil case Donald can only Appeal on matters of law he cannot Appeal on the findings of fact by the judge which are thoroughly described in a 35-page opinion with specific examples including Trump's own statements where he in essence said about his financial statements oh everybody knows you can't rely on my financial statements and the judge said I'm sorry we're not living in a fantasy world uh he asserted that a rent regulated apartment was worth worth just as much as a free market apartment which is absurd and the judge knocked that down so they will appeal on anything that is the law they will be ignored and they may find some technical issue I haven't been able to find one and I've interviewed other people who know the civil law in New York well and they don't see anything there either that is appealable as a matter of law are successfully appealable and there is no appeal should be no appeal to federal court because there is no federal issue here this is entirely a New York State issue States decide who gets to run a business under our system not the federal government because the founding fathers never thought about corporations and regulation when they wrote the Constitution so how long are we talking about timeline wise for the progression of this that depends on how successful Donald Trump's lawyers are at delaying and Donald's always been big on delay but remember his lawyers here made up facts just like their client does five of them were each fined $7500 for frivolous arguments that is repeating arguments the judge had rejected but more importantly they actually limited the quoted language of an important court case in the filings to turn it on its head and given their unclean hands their misconduct here uh they're not going to have a sympathetic appeals court and frankly they may face disbarment or other disciplinary proceedings by the New York State Bar so if the president loses the appeals the status of his ability to do business is in the future is one thing but all of these existing businesses what happens to them they have to be liquidated they will continue to operate under right now the eye of a monitor Jud a retired judge named Barbara Jones Donald cannot take any salary or money from them and the reason is that uh these are illot gains if you committed fraud and you made a profit because of the fraud that is an illot gain and here's the way to think about that you have an employer who you work for who closes Friday night and opens up on Monday you take $100 from the employer you go to the casino you win $1,000 you put the $100 back before the business reopens you've committed two crimes one you're a thief but secondly your Casino win is an illot gain and if you're caught you have to give up all that money and that's what's happened to Trump here his illot gains have to be turned back and we don't know how much that's going to be we only know that the New York State Attorney General has asked for $250 million indicating the scope of this which is enormous so regardless of how people might feel about the president there are employees arguably in many of these dozens of these businesses from the groundskeeper at say a golf course to a doorman in a building what happens to them the employees will continue to get paid and businesses will operate until some new owner comes along so the businesses will will operate as they have been but not at the direction of Donald Trump or his sons or the two Executives that are named in the lawsuit so when you look at the the findings was there anything surprising to you I mean given you're not the average person who's been following Trump as closely as you have for the last 35 years but when you saw something any anything that jump jump out from you for you no that that that's a very interesting question and no Harry there wasn't anything that jumped out at me all of these things were consistent with Donald's long history of just creating his own reality he says it in his mind that makes it so and the overvaluations I'd written about a number of them in the past you know he claimed that his estate in Westchester County just north of Manhattan was worth at 1. $291 million His Highest appraisal put it at about 30 million but that was based on the idea that he could carve it up into a group of Other Mansions and yet local authorities said no we're not going to let you carve it up which means it's not even worth what that appraisal said so he was valuing this at about 40 times what it's probably actually worth and you know a little edge here if he said his 11,000 square foot Trump Tower apartment was 12,000 square feet but he said it was over 30,000 square feet that's fraud plain and simple you know this is different than when the Manhattan da was investigating the for for president and declined to bring charges um this is a result of New York attorney general Leticia James filing this suit is there a difference in the scope here the judge and the current civil case repeatedly cites criminal law and I and some others have written articles saying there's a very strong criminal fraud case but the difference is Criminal fraud requires proof Beyond a reasonable de out whereas in a civil case you only need a preponderance of the evidence more than half and so Leticia James took the easier route here uh I think it's a very good question will uh the Manhattan district attorney or the southern district of New York the federal prosecutorial agency uh go back and look at this as a criminal fraud matter I don't expect them to but uh I think they have plenty of grounds to if they want to bring a case you know the the former president also has a long history of settling out of court and is this a different era I mean are there kind of different Stars aligned here where there is an incentive not to settle uh on the part of the state if Donald Trump had not become president I don't think you would see any of these cases because he's engaged in outrageous behavior his whole life so he's not alone among business people who are really high level con artists who get away with stuff because that's not where law enforcement is focused and Donald is in my view the greatest con artist in the history of the world I mean I admire his success as a con artist he conned his way all the way into the White House David K Johnson thanks so much for joining us thank [Music] you [Music]"
