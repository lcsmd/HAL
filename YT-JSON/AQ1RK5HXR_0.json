        "transcript": "could chat gbt ever be more than just a chat bot what's up guys my name is Jason and this is learn build repeat open AI released chat GPT November 30th 2022 and almost right from the beginning I've been fascinated with it now I'm sure by now that you've likely heard of it and I've used the chat GPT website but I've always wondered to myself what would it actually be like to talk to chat GPT you know like a real person where you're able to use real sentences and Converse in natural language could it be more than just a chat bot could it be a mentor an assistant or perhaps even a friend so in an attempt to answer this question I built this a wearable chat GPT companion that you can have conversations with using natural language you can clip it onto your shirt and take it with you wherever you go and admittedly it is a little bit big and bulky and doesn't look very good because it's an early prototype but it actually does work let me show you Greg say hello to my YouTube audience hello YouTube audience Greg here hope you're all doing well and I'm excited to see what we can chat about today fire away with your question questions or topics and that's right I actually gave this thing a name and if you want to try this out I actually made a free website where you can go to to play around with it it's been kind of a side project I've been working on for the past year the link should be shown on the screen right now so if you want to check it out here it is now let's dive into exactly what this device is that I'm holding and how it works I built my wearable device from these three components here in the middle is a Raspberry Pi and no I'm not talking about desert it's actually just a little computer that sits on this board right here and then on the left and right are what are called called pie hats on the left is a battery so that I can make my device mobile and on the right is an audio card that has a microphone and speaker so that I can talk to it and it can talk back to [Music] [Music] me [Music] and then I just assemble it all together using a few screws but getting the software to work was a little bit more tricky but I'm a software engineer by trade so honestly it wasn't too bad to put it simply it works like this this device is streaming all the audio to a server I have set up in the cloud This Server is then streaming this audio to Google speech DET text service this is a service that Google offers that will convert everything I'm saying into text then once I have enough text I'm sending that off to gp4 to get a response once gp4 responds I'll convert that back into speech using open AI text to speech and then I'm playing the audio on these speakers here it honestly is fairly straightforward it is a lot of streaming data I'm dealing with but after a little bit of trial and error I was able to get it to work now the really cool thing about this is I'm using gp4 which is open ai's latest and greatest AI model it provides the largest context of any model out there there as it filming this video it provides up to 128,000 tokens of context in other words this translates roughly into half a million characters or about 83,000 words using some simplifying assumptions or to put it another way you would have to talk for 10 hours continuously to reach that 83,000 word limit this device can remember all of that and provide you with intelligent responses about anything you said within those 10 hours this brings me to my first point about why this thing is so incredible memory I don't know about you but if you're getting older you kind of realize that your memory isn't quite as good as it used to be sometimes you forget a fact here or there or you have to ask someone to repeat something to get around this you could take a lot of notes or just record all your conversations it would be so much easier just to have GPT 4 listen to everything you say analyze your conversation so that you can ask about it later in fact let's try it right now Greg could you tell me something I've been talking about it seems you've been excitedly discussing the capabilities of particularly its memory capacity which is significantly greater than previous models you've highlighted the ability of4 to hold a large context window of around 83,000 words which could compare to roughly 10 hours of continuous speech as one of the reasons why it's so incredible you've also touched on the challenges of human memory as we age and proposed that GPT 4 could effectively serve as a tool to compensate for these lapses by recalling information from conversations it has been privy to would you like to explore more about GPT 4's functions or continue discussing human memory and Technology now I'm not sure about you but I find this tremendously useful but this device goes so much farther than just memory and recall which brings me to my second Point knowledge the way gp4 works or any of these large language models is that theyve essentially been trained in all the publicly available data on the internet which is a lot of data this means they know all the Articles the documents books magazines and much more and this is a big deal because these taxs cumulatively essentially contain all of human knowledge and this little device can immediately tell you any question any topic that you might have and it brings it directly to you in a personalized manner to answer the question that you asked now there are some limitations with this it doesn't have the most up-to-date information and sometimes in order for it to have like a fluent flowing conversation with you sometimes it will hallucinate a little bit but as these models improve that will become less and less of a big deal so these things are pretty amazing you want to know anything you can just ask want to know how to build something just ask want to know how to cook something just ask in fact let's try it now Greg could you give me a short recipe for fish tacos sure I can give you a simple recipe for fish tacos one lb white fish like cod mahimahi or tilapia 1 tbsp olive oil 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon paprika or smoked paprika for a smokier flavor 1/ teaspoon garlic powder salt and pepper to taste eight small corn or flour tortillas 2 cups shredded cabbage or col SLO mix one ripe avocado sliced fresh cilantro chopped for garnish lime wedges for serving okay that's good enough for that and then this brings me to my final point about gp4 is that these things you're so intelligent gp4 isn't about accessing all this knowledge it's about actually having conversations with you and helping you reason about what you're trying to do it'll be able to analyze your conversations that you have for up to 10 hours if you were to talk to it continuously and give you intelligent insights about what you've said it'll be able to answer questions about your conversational history which is is super important and it does all of this in a very humanlike fashion but as you heard it sounds like a human too in fact one time I was waiting for a dinner reservation and I had this thing with me and because I was so bored I used it to play a game with me to help pass the time so let me so let me clip this onto my shirt real quick I'm just using a magnet to hold it in place so we set out to answer the question is this device more than just a chatbot is it a mentor an assistant perhaps even a friend well I can confidently say it's not a friend but it's definitely super useful when you're you're trying to actually do things in your life that require some knowledge that you perhaps you don't have and the way that I can talk to it using natural language and have it talk back to me is frankly amazing it makes it so much easier and so much more natural to have conversations with it and because it can remember up to 10 hours worth of conversations that you had with it all this context makes it give you really amazing answers frankly I am so surprised that this thing works as well as it does I plan on using this for a lot of daily tasks now in fact I was cooking dinner the other night and literally just opened up the fridge and it was able to like step by step walk me through a cooking recipe for those tailored ingredients and alsoon was incredible and it turned out pretty well and I think going into the future you're going to see more devices like this these are going to become ubiquitous because it they're so useful it's hard to deny the usefulness of these devices because they bring so much knowledge directly into your particular situation and they do it in such a personalized manner that it's so easy to ingest but just remember you saw one of the first wearable chat gbt devices here so to sum it all up I do think that these will become more than just chat Bots and become super useful companions that you'll use in your daily life with that being said thank you guys for watching and I'll see you in the next [Music] one"
