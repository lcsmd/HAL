        "transcript": "in this video we're going to take gpts and then we're going to add something to it and the combination of these two it's kind of a big deal here's why one a lot of this is no code meaning that you don't have to be a software developer you don't need to know how to code to get up and running with this about 20 minutes from now you know how to put together some pretty incredible automation processes with zero lines of code being written and two this is getting very close to autonomous AI agents we're not right there yet but boy are we close gpts are pretty cool in and of themselves but there's some things they can't do there's a lot of software they can't interact with you have to initiate them you have to click on things you have to be there to get the function out of it they don't run 24 hours a day doing things on your behalf but you add some zaps that's what the zapier automation things are called and Magic starts to happen you're a wizard hairy this video will have two parts in the first part we will go over how to use zapier we will build an automation also known as a Zap for this example we will create a custom AI generated video for each customer that signs up in the second part of the video you will see how to connect gpts and zapier make sure you subscribe to this channel that will allow you to learn how to build these god tier AI automations so when I signed up for haen the founder joshwa sent me a little video to welcome me on board now I assumed it was a cookie cut or video that he sents to everybody it's just the same video he shot once that he sends to everybody that signs up but it was actually a personalized video for me take a listen Hey where's R thanks for your interest in our ultra realistic Avatar feature for teaching generative a we appreciate your enthusiasm he knew my name and he knew that I was using this technology to teach generative AI knowing that he took the time to shoot that video made me feel special unique and cared for and we'll get back to you soon by the way this is a ultimated video message share the with my Al hope you find it helpful and we'll talk soon okay so maybe I wasn't as special as I thought cuz this is AI generated could we utilize the same technology yes let's do it so here I logged into my hey Jen account so we need to find my API key we're going to go over here to space settings and here's the API so it looks like it's available for business or Enterprise members I think I have the Creator like the the first paid tier but hoay for us they do have a trial token where you can do up to five videos per day and they have the API instructions here in case you wanted to take a look so if you're using the API they do have the outline of how to do that here but for us again we're using zapier to do this so we're going to go here we're going to click activate we're going to copy this token then we're going to go into our zapier account yes I do have the 20,000 task per month plan and yes I think I do need to downgrade it cuz I'm not really using it so we're going to go into the apps and so the apps is all the software that you can use to integrate using zap beard to other pieces of software or to gpts or to whatever so you might recognize some of these beehive Circle clickfunnels Gmail MailChimp optin monster Etc but we're going to search for hen hey there's haen click connect and this little message window pops up and so it says do you want to connect your haen account to zapier all we have to do here is pay p in our API key and once you've pasted that in Just click yes continue to haen I've blocked my haen API key because I know that if you get your hands on it you're going to make me say all sorts of dirty stuff and I don't want that to happen all right so now we have that connection and now we can use any of zapier's whatever it is 6,000 apps to connect to haen so let's take a look at how we do that all right next let's attach Gmail to this so that we can control some of these actions that are triggered some of these actions based on triggers that happen in Gmail so for example when you get a new email with a new subscriber something happens so let's go here and put Gmail Gmail all right there's Gmail we're going to click connect all right so I've signed into my account and I'll click allow and now we've connected Gmail to zapier all right now the fun begins let's create a zap and so here it has this little cool uh sort of 3D display where we can zoom in zoom out and basically it's kind of like a mind map of things that happen so so Step One is the thing that starts the snowball rolling so what is the first thing that happens that triggers the series of events that you want to happen so in our case that's a Gmail that happens in Gmail so some sort of an email comes in right so in Gmail what event triggers this so in our case let's use there's multiple different ones you can use and so here let's try the new email matching search for example there are different ways of doing this you can do any specific label in Gmail or let's try this depending on what you're trying try to create there's going to be a few different ways you can do it so here there's a search string so there's some sequence of characters that appears in the email that's going to flag it as a something that zapier needs to run so for example let's just make something up something that's unlikely to appear in a regular email so for example here we're going to do in single quotes new cust as a new customer and we're going to finish that with a single quote so anytime we see an email with that in it appear this will trigger this zap to run we'll see how that works in just a second so we'll click continue so here we're going to shoot a quick email to that Gmail account so we're going to put the new cust the trigger word in the title and then for the body of the email we're just going to put the name of the new customer so so we're going to write babo how about that babo that's going to be a new customer so we'll click Send all right so we have our trigger and here we're going to have Hy Jen as as the thing that we want to happen once this email comes in so here's the email that came in so the snippet is Bob o that's the one we're looking at we're going to continue with the selected record and then for hey Jen once that comes in we're going to create a video and on the input text so this is the thing that we wanted to say so we're going to say we're going to use the customers name babo comma welcome to the machine I don't know whatever test success so part of setting these things up is running what sometimes is referred to as unit tests so it's basically test each portion of this to make sure that it's working so then once you figure out how to make one thing work then you connect everything together and you know that the whole process is going to work but if if this fails then we know okay this is the thing that we have to fix so it's just so we're doing this for testing purposes and then we select the voice ID so so well we need English for sure since we're talking in English so we'll do Paul natural English mail let's try that and we click continue and now we're going to to see if it works and so a video was sent to hey Jen and it confirmed that it was a success all right so it says your zap is on and so I'm seeing it now being processed here so to recap an email came in with the new customer and their name so it automatically took the customer's name and it added some text and it sent it to hey Jen to generate that image or that video rather he Jen started processing that that video with the Avatar that we selected and again it could be me doing that we would just have to hook up my avatar to it or could be one of their sort of generic avatars that they have their pre-existing pre-recorded avatars whatever language you want so if you have um customers from different languages you can even have it automatically select what language you want to do all of that is fully customizable within the zappier platform so here it's completed so I guess this is whatever his name was Paul in a yellow sweater let's see let's see how it worked out Bob oh welcome to the machine test success Bob oh welcome to the machine test success all right so he's saying Bob oh welcome Bob oh welcome to the machine test success all right so that worked now I'm thinking about it it would be better if he started with some text like you successfully signed up and then said the name but we'll we'll come back to that so let's take a look at our zaps so let me so this is so I'm back in this view let me click on this and see if we can edit some of the stuff all right so we're going to click edit zap so we're going to click on this to edit and now for the text so we're going to start with hello there comma and then the name and then we're going to end sentence and we're going to start a new on saying welcome to the machine so he's going to say now he's going to say hello there babo welcome to the machine also Alex and yellow sweater is not doing it for me no offense Alex let's see if we can do better so let's do female and we're going to do this is kind of insane looking this is like a Victorian Garb welcome to the new era of video Creation with hey Jan let's try that so this is going to be Monica and dress so we're use Monica and dress and then we also going to make sure to change the voice so let's do English female and whatever we'll use something that's cheerful Anna continue all right all right we're going to test the step so they're going to send that video to hey Jen all right so let's see how that works so this is the video that was created let's take a listen hello there babo welcome to the machine it's not quite what I had in mind but I guess it will be memorable the whole thing is just a little bit scary right hello there babo welcome to the machine all right yeah that's frightening but you know what we're just testing this out obviously when you're doing it live for customers you want to make sure that the Avatar is good the voice is good all of that can be set for the time being we're just going to go with it all right so the next step will be to once that video is completed we want to retrieve that video to make sure that we have that we're able to send it to people so so how we do that is once again we pull up haen and so the next step is going to be to get the actual sharable link from from that video so we're going to retrieve sharable link for a video continue we're going to click continue and here here's all the videos that we've been doing uh so custom one we're going to click custom and this shows the steps that we did so far and those will have all the data that that we need to make this happen so you know all the data in that emails here when we've created the haen thing all the data for that is here so here basically what we need is the output video ID so it's a unique ID that was generated so we'll put that in the video ID column and we're going to continue and then we're going to click test step perfect and so that's our little sharable link that was sent to us so we're going to copy that and we're just going to go ahead and paste it in here and test it so I pasted it into my browser and there it is and now comes the last and final step is we're going to send that video to our customer and hope he doesn't unsubscribe so we're going to add another Gmail step we're going to say send send email continue from that account continue and who is it going to now normally what you would do here is if you have the customer's email you know that original email you got in Gmail you would find it here and use that you would plop that email right in there right now just for testing purposes I'm going to go ahead and just send it to ourselves and the subject will be test video now keep in mind that since we have all this data if you wanted to customize the subject to for example include the name of the person we can do that so for example if we do test videos comma and then we'll select the name of the person so that's going to get put into the video and in the body of the email we're going to say hello here's a video I made for you and then here we're going to link the video that we made so there it is we're going to click on the sharable link and that's it we're going to click continue so let's test that step all right and so there it is test babo so it sent this email with the name of the customer in the subject line it says hello here's a video I made for you and it has a link that we click on hello there babo hello there babo and so that's it so our zap has been created it has been tested and now every single time that email comes in matching those specifications zappier will extract the details that it needs to create a video in haen it'll retrieve that sharable link and then send the customer an email now obviously as you can see the there's a lot of things that you can customize in here there's a lot of data there's there's tons of fields that you can customize and and tweak and optimize so this is just a sort of basic framework for how to do that but you see how easy it was how fast it was you didn't need any code you didn't need any any complicated stuff it's all in there you can do this with 6,000 different apps that's under sort of the zapier radar The Next Step would be to really test it from beginning to end you know for example here between the time you create a video and retrieve a video some time passes as a develops thatat so you want to make sure that this this doesn't fail if it takes too long so here you might use a step for example you can do delay by zapier so you can do like a delay for a set amount of time or delay after Q which is going to be very important especially if you're using the gpts that have rate limits let me go back here for a second so it says here so delay after Q so this waits for a certain amount of time after the last delay in a given Que used to deal with race conditions and rate limiting so with gpts you are going to deal with rate limiting so using this is going to help you deal with that but basically you know you do one thing then you wait a minute then you do another thing then you wait a minute to make sure you're not running into any limiting actions and getting error messages so once you have the set up and it's working you still got to make sure you kind of stress test it make sure that if something doesn't run quite properly that the whole thing doesn't break and zapier does a great way of notifying you when things don't run so you will get messages is going hey this might not be working take a look and then it it'll show you and it's all pretty straightforward it's not because this is supposed to be a no code application they do a pretty good job of kind of breaking it down and making it simple you now know how to build full-blown automations using zapier now let's move on to part two in this section let's see how to combine the power of gpts with the simple automation abilities of zapier the first step is to join your open AI account with your zappier account so one of the things you have to do is connect your openi account to the zappier account an easy way is to just visit this URL so this is zappier URL actions. zapier.com GPT actions so I'll provide this link in the show notes but just you know visit that link and then so you're going to see this thing saying openai wants to access your zappier account for AI actions all right so we'll click allow so looks like I got an error message but I think that's because I haven't defined any AI actions yet so I just went back to the page page actions.com GPT actions so I just reopened it and so this page appears this is once you've connected it this is the page that will show all the actions that you have and you can add a new action here all right so we're going to click add a new action and here we have so we can type to search thousands of apps and actions so for example with Gmail we can do the following things with Gmail if we wanted to do stripe Payment Processing for example there's stripe clickfunnels if you use that to build various landing pages there's your clickfunnels Google various Google things so you can do Google Docs Gmail Google Slides Google contacts Google Drive so we can find a file in the Google Drive that is very cool YouTube so looks like you can get some specified data from your own channels I did not know that I was in there Google tasks that could be interesting we have R create new link post Tumblr GitHub Facebook so Twitter looks like it doesn't have direct integration but let's see X twily video allows you to send cheap SMS messages text messages even call numbers by the way I just finished reading demon by Daniel Suarez about this Rogue AI that but it's it's really good just this idea of calling somebody's phone and using AI text to speech if you read that book you know what I'm talking about and this of course is just your basic Gmail if you have a Gmail account connected to zappier you can have chat GPT the gpts compose various emails for you and just send them to various email addresses or have them answer emails as they come in I I don't think people are getting where we are what what time we're living in right now because this is we're going to start seeing some pretty wild stuff that's going to begin to happen all right but let's set up our first real action so this going to be Gmail we're just going to send email just so we can walk through the process of doing this and to see how that works so we're going to click Send email that's going to be my corporate account so if you have multiple Gmail accounts connected you can use those you have to connect one first so step one would be connecting all those accounts that you need to connect in order to make this work we already covered that earlier so you know so if you need to connect it go back to the dashboard connect the apps that you need to and then they're going to show up here and then we're going to have the two field who are we sending it to the subject and the body of the email all right and then here at the bottom so you can fill out whatever you want but let's just leave it let's just leave it as is and we're going to have the GPT do all this for us all right and then the action name so this is the thing you're going to call this action and this is what we're going to tell the GPT to do so I'm going to call this send email from natural 20 Gmail how about that and here we're going to click require preview before running AI action so when you're setting this up when you're just testing it this will allow you to see what it's doing before it does it later on once you know everything's working you can disable that and have it just run automatically all right and then we're going to click enable action so as you can see here now at this page which is actions. zapier gbt actions so again a lot of this is going to be on this page that's that's the page that we're talking about so keep in mind this is the zapier domain so we're on their domain and this is just a page that has a list of all the actions that we can connect to open AI so then you can add a new action but right now we got our first action which is send email and now we're going to go back to the GPT Builder so I know this can be a little bit confusing so this is we're back to the open AI site here is so here here's that website so for readability it's chat. openen eyes.com gpts editor or you can just do SL create and that's going to forward you over here you know obviously just put those as bookmarks so you can just click on it versus trying to remember all this stuff the reason I point this up here is just so you can kind of mentally understand whose site we're on who who we're dealing with so with actions we're on the zapier site when we're building gpts were on the openingi site that's that's just the main point of all this so now we're conversating with GPT Builder which if you saw my previous video every once in a while he Goofs up so I don't know if I like GPT Builder I think I prefer to just click configure a less chance of stuff going wrong so name your GPT so we're going to call it zapier test and description will be testing zapier I'm feeling very creative today all right so instructions let's hang off on that let's just enable all the capabilities just so we don't run into any issues later obviously once we know exactly what we're doing we can disable the ones we don't need we obviously going to need web browsing for this one since it's communicating with zapier actually I'm not sure if that's true or not but I feel like we are safeer just having that on all right next and so this is where it gets a little bit tricky so scroll to the bottom of this configure screen right at the very bottom you have your actions and actions are described as apis this GPT can use all right we're going to click add actions and so here it's a little bit hidden right because this is what we need import from URL it doesn't even look like a button but you click on that and you need to put in the URL into here it's a specific URL that comes from zapier that will import all the needed functionality where do you get that so I'll leave a link in the description obviously but if you ever forget just Google zapier AI actions GPT and so this this second one under docs is the one that we're looking for here's what that bee looks like and if you just scroll down you know here's is where we have the get started section so it's saying copy this special URL to your clipboard and so basically this is from zapier and it's giving the GPT all the apis that it's going to need you don't need to really understand what this is just copy it and then do all the things that we just went through so open a new GPT create a new GPT click configure scroll down click actions and then click that button again just like we talked about so let's go back to so again this is where we were right so let me go back so you scroll down add actions import from URL bam right and this is where that is going to go so we're going to copy this full thing plop that right in there by the way this is probably the most difficult part of this so if you can get through this you're in the clear all right then we're going to hit import and so that's going to contain all of this uh text in there you can pretty much ignore it it just gives opening eye the gpts all the information they need to do certain actions on your behalf using zapier all right and down here it says available actions so it gives us two it has list what's available and then run a particular action and there's an available action ID that goes in there all right then I clicked back all right and now when you scroll down here under actions you have actions. zapier.com additional settings is just you can opt out of this AI getting trained on your stuff so I'm going to save this really fast and it's going be just for me for the time being this one you don't want out there because it's using your zapier API so you don't want to be sharing that all right so we're going to message it and we're going to ask what are all the available actions with zapier let's see okay so it knows what we're talking about so it's saying some info will be sent there so it's basically running this API call to see what actions are available so remember that's this page right so right now we only have the send the email but as you add more and more more more more you're going to be able to see which ones are available and then you can turn them on and off so for example if you have one but you don't want to show up you turn it off so it asks me to click on sign in again even though we did this already so keep in mind this is Alpha this is this still very early on so sometimes you might have to do a couple different things over and over again so I'm going to click allow once again by the way so there's some stuff here I've cut out because sometimes it'll break it'll crash so just whenever you run into any issues just try refreshing it try and going back to the original page if it keeps breaking start the GPT process the creation over again I feel like you know very quickly within a few weeks or a few months all this is going to be solved but if you're doing this early this is part of the process you got to put up with some crap but you know just just don't get frustrated just reset it try it again Etc so let me try this again I'm going to ask the same question again so what are the available actions so some info will be sent okay so see it's asking me allow I'm going to go ahead and click always allow so look at that so it found our zapier our zapier action send email from natural 20 Gmail and it can even uh we can even click this uh config uration link to go to zapier and configure that further all right so we're going to say use that action to send an email to so use that actually to send an email to contact natural 20.com the email subject line will be available zaps and the body is your description of the available actions that I have and a brief explanation of what they do so basically this so what we're going to be doing is we're going to be having GPT draft an email for us I'm not going to write the email it's going to do it now obviously this is just a test so it's kind of like not very useful but just imagine what can be done so instead of sending an email to this to myself basically you know you can have it answer customer questions you can have it text message people if you want to get fancy you can even create a text to speech and have it call somebody and leave a voicemail for example you can have it send you motivational emails every morning can even be in the style of Arnold Schwarzenegger right something like work hard and be useful that was terrible it's more like get to the chopper all right so that's it let's click Send message let's see what it does so this is interesting so here sometimes you're going to see two different responses and so if you're not aware you know there's a few reasons for this one is you can choose the better response that helps you get the better response but if you've heard that term R lhf reinforcement learning with human feedback it basically trains these models with human feedback to provide better answers in this case the human feedback the human is you you're training it to be better in this case it's well it's identical really so let's allow actually I assume it's identical but maybe there's some stuff it's not showing me ohay so I'm oh here we go okay so this I can actually see what's available and the instructions is this so let's first of all review the email when we click on review the email so that takes us to zap here so two and and it sends it to that email subject is available zap which I think that's what we said yeah and so well the problem is so the body is it just copied and pasted what I told it to do so as you can see here you're actually you're able to see it here so as you can see here this is what it's sending to Z here so instructions is you know the body of the email should describe the available actions with a brief explanation of what they do so so right now keep in mind again this is very early there's going to be a lot of bugs there's going to be a lot of issues your ability to get the most benefit out of it is going to be determined by your ability to learn its little quirks and eccentricities and figure out how to get around them Wes struggled for quite a while to get this GPT to write out this email I'll edit out his struggle except for this part nobody okay you know that Meme where the guy picks up his uh his keyboard he just like smashes everything around his office that's that's that's we might get there yet all right let's try that again there are a few keys that you need to mention in the prompt to make it work one ask it to work through it step by step two tell it to send the full body text in the API instructions but still no body pass the pass the body text in the instructions field so I'm going to ask you to pass the body text in the instructions field all right so what it did now is it wrote this out and including this code and now it's preparing that request and uh it's going to show me a preview all right so the email has been successfully prepared let's see fifth times the charm oh baby is it okay to feel proud about the GPT you have just created figuring out what you wanted to do is that okay so yeah as you can see here it nailed the body YouTube's going to think I'm talking about something completely different I'm saying it correctly identified the body text all right and here's that email that was sent so just to recap cuz um I ran into some issues with giving it the proper instructions for it to be able to send that email correctly with the zapier actions if you run into issues where it doesn't include the body field the body text the key to fixing that I so what I told to do is is pass the body text in the instructions field so when it sends the thing to zapier the only two the only two things it needs is this available action ID which is the so that's the action idea that it's used and then the instructions so as you can see here it includes the two field the subject line and includes the body the body text it goes all the way that whole thing's in there and now that's it so we have just used a GPT to use zapier to send ourselves an email that may not seem like a big deal but as we've discussed these are the Lego pieces that you can put together to create some incredible automations you've connected Ed two very powerful pieces of software one is zapier this logic based thing that just hooks into 6,000 plus apps on an internet that's super easy to use that's no code and the second thing is well just the most advanced AI that we have access to this is an absolute game Cher as we're going to be building more and more stuff with it you're going to see how far this can take you just these two things so stick around as I'm recording this it just turned 420 on 1111 it's 4:20 p.m. on November 11th that's weird is it I don't know Wes didn't know it at the time but that was recorded in the same moment Sam Altman posted this weird but my point is this is big make sure you're make sure you're following along cuz um it just it it this seems like it's a lot bigger than most people realize at this time please subscribe to his channel we're going to be doing a lot more tutorials keeping up on the latest things what we've been seeing is just scratching the surface I think by next year the stuff that we're going to be able to build with this is going to be is going to be mind-blowing and it does seem more and more that writing code being able to read code being able to develop software you know it's still important it's still beneficial it's still a incredible skill to have if you're a coder you have an incredibly useful skill obviously but what this is showing to me is that if you're not a coder if you haven't put in the 10,000 hours needed to master software development that's okay it really seems like that's not going to hold you back you do still need to learn you still need to keep up with this stuff you still need to learn a few new skills but it does seem like maybe that's not going to be it's not going to be a prerequisite to be successful with this stuff anyways I hope you enjoyed that my name is Wes rth thank you for watching as a special bonus here's a song about open Ai and zapier lyrics audio and vocals all AI generated of bril where genius is found down together they embark on a journey so Grand synthesizing AI with automation hand in hand open eyes power Symphony of code s finest CL Untold Unison of Minds a Harmony so true Innovation rings as they dance me and you"
