Genuinely hyped for the team and can't wait to see where things go. Will this help me stop missing Sublime Text? Will my search for the perfect IDE stop here?

        "transcript": "VSS code love it or hate it it's become the norm for quite a while now I still remember working at twitch being the one person who just would not give up on Sublime Text when I started writing more unit tests for weird typescript functionality I was introduced to the VSS code debugger by a cooworker which was a huge help in me running the tests and playing with things as I went along and ended up slowly making the shift as a result that all said I missed the performance while I could sit here and defend electron all day I'll admit the performance is something you feel in a text editor while vs code is way faster than Alternatives were like Adam you definitely feel that it's a browser not a native editor and when you use something like Sublime Text or even things like Vim the speed at which a key press results in a key being on your screen it's small but you feel it and I definitely understand why people miss a native IDE this is why I'm really excited to talk about Zed today Zed's a really interesting editor because it's trying to find the balance between native performance you would expect from things like vim and a plugin UI focused ecosystem similar to vs code where you can kind of get the best of both worlds it is not just being cre cre by some random people it's actually being built by the original creators of Adam and those Adam creators didn't just invent one of the first modern text editors they actually built electron just to make atom possible in a lot of ways you can almost see this as an undoing of the damage that electron did where this team wants to make a much better performing editor that doesn't compromise on the user experience the same way other things might do Now Zed is open source this is a huge change that I honestly didn't expect because Zed's a startup they have to make money somehow open sourcing the editor is a bold to make but not only are they open sourcing they actually rewrote most of the code in the process so why the big rewrite last week was my first week at Zed I joined right as the team was preparing for this week's release which they referred to as zed 2 big things in the air this release marks the end of the team's multi-month rewrite of zi framework GPI from V1 to V2 all hands on deck everybody fixing the last bugs polishing Zed and I the newcomer had so many questions why the big rewrite how'd you pull it off what does this get you how do you organize it this is really cool that they're like publishing this type of stuff about why they're doing these bold rewrites and that the whole video is on YouTube as well I'm not here to talk about the rewrite though I'm here to talk about the open source release and actually play with z a bit if you want to hear more about big rewrites like this let me know in the comments and maybe I'll make a whole video just about this rewrite we're excited to announce that Z is an open source project the code for Z SS available under a copy left license to ensure any improvements will benefit the entire Community GPL for the editor a GPL for serers side components interesting that they went with standard GPL for the editor and the Apache modification of it for the serers side stuff makes sense for them to make sure they a business they can sell but fascinating to see this type of like split licensing for a product if you think I should talk more about licensing for open source let me know cuz it's thing I have a lot of weird opinions on they also mentioned the GPI rewrite that they are Distributing as well under Apache so anyone can use it to build high performance desktop apps and distribute them under any license that's huge that's really cool good open source why are they doing this most importantly they believe that making Z open source will make it the best product our mission is to build the world's most advanced code editor and get it in the hands of millions of developers there's a ton of surface area on the platform and will need all the help we can get considering that all of Zed's users are programmers it makes the most sense to open Zed to the maximum pool of talent this is a really good point since everyone using Zed is going to be a developer letting them contribute to it makes a ton of sense makes a ton of sense really cool to see them thinking in this way on a more selfish level we also think going open source will be a lot more fun one of our favorite aspects of software is connecting with people we're not only proud of what we've built but also how we've built it we want to share Zed's inner beauty with all of you and we're confident we'll learn a lot from you in the process to make it even better they're also introducing this idea of Fire hacks where you can hang out with people in The Zed channels talk with other developers people contributing people not and they'll be running Fireside hacks in them where they work on Zed live and a public Channel this is super cool I love these like Community opportunities to hang with people really nice stuff and then they talk about the money aspect cuz this is important too CU they're a startup they need to make money eventually and they say specifically that they strongly believe the best way to build and maintain the world's best editor is by associating it with a sustainable business model it's the only way they can continue to invest in a full-time team to spearhead Dev some may wonder if making it open source undermines that objective but they thought about it a lot and they don't think the openness is at odds with the commercial success rather than selling you a proprietary editor we'd much prefer to sell you services that seamlessly integrate with your Editor to make you and your team more productive said channels is just one example it's free for anyone today but they intend to begin charging for private use after a beta period of experimentation providing serers side compute to power AI features is another monetization scheme they're seeing getting traction and I've seen this more and more with companies recently where they're trying to become a standard first and then monetize later I think it works really well I'm curious to see how it goes for an editor nobody's really tried this at this integration level usually editors either charge or don't make money charging later to make money is an interesting strategy that requires more investment for them to find success but seems like they're building something really special here and I'm excited to see how it goes for them they're not at one point oh yet though so know this is still early but it is a really exciting rewrite I want to play with it so I guess there's nothing else to do other than click this download button so let's do it download for Mac OS one more thing of note at this point in time Zed is Mac only they do plan to support other Platforms in the future but let's be honest with the things that they're targeting Mac devs are going to be the majority of users anyways and they'll certainly be the majority of potentially paying users in the future so as a business tries to figure out if they have something with traction that could possibly make money in the future it makes a ton of sense that they're not supporting windows and Linux just yet anyways here is Zed one of the cool things they actually have a Vim mode built in does that mean this is officially Prime agine approved to be determined I don't have Vim bindings in my head anymore so I'm not going to check that they really thought of the setup process here where you can pick a theme doesn't seem like they have the PO Manders theme I don't know you could install custom ones or not but they don't have my preferred one which makes sense it's a pretty Niche theme so let's go with the default for now choose a key mapping vs code yes please don't make me learn new things it's cool that they let you take the mappings from other programs and the default is vs code where they're just copying the vs code keepy bindings really good idea don't make me learn all these other new things when I'm just trying to play with a new editor and then install the CLI we'll take a look at the upload thing public code base so cool here's our project it is very minimal I've seen people saying that already but I do like how how muted things are I don't love the lack of color in the icons cuz like I can mentally map things when they have color but it's also like almost everything's just TS TS TS TS in blue so how much does that really matter debatable I don't know if you guys know this but the VSS code CLI is slow as [ __ ] so if I type code period we're going to press enter right now and that took like a second plus to switch over I actually have a custom binding that you might have seen me use C that is an alias that just calls the vs code application directly and when I do this instead I'm going to press enter right now it's literally instant and as seems to care about that this lets you load the application way faster and the specific CLI thing they're using to get those ARs and parse them is just not very fast let's start by playing with the hot keys that worked great is there a Hut key for hiding and showing the sidebar command B that's Snappy scrolling feels a little Jank I don't know how much this will come up like in the recording because I'm recording 30 FPS even though my screen's running 120 but the scrolling feel less good this is actually something I noticed when I first played with Z is that scrolling felt a little weird yeah a ton of inertia that's a good way to describe it Vim Tim in chat so love that a vimmer has opinions on this one thing that really annoys me in vs code is when I'm trying to delete like a section of text so let's try and delete here up to functions CU When I go here it Scrolls too fast this is way better for that already it's a small thing but these are the things I want to test CU I want to see what my day-to-day is like in this editor let's say I want to delete everything from line 122 to like 200 something let's say to 205 how easy is it for me to get to exactly 205 that was pretty easy versus in vs code we'll start at 122 and I want to get to exactly 205 and it Scrolls way too fast no matter how far you go and it's a good bit harder I've had a lot of annoyance with that why not scroll down to the line and shift click cuz I don't think that far ahead probably a good call oh look at that they light things up bright green when there are changes in git okay am I crazy or does that icon look like Source control to you cuz this icon looks to me like Source control not like files I might be insane but that looks like a source control icon with the branching how fast does the git update that's a good question too and let's see what happens that was instant that was instant good [ __ ] yeah vs codes is not anywhere near that fast now all these things are staged you can't even see it in vs code commit DM init commit and vs code doesn't update these things in the background in order to see the update I have to go back here and then it will update but I bet some older files oh no it updated everything I'm sure all of you that use VSS code really hard have had the problem where it doesn't see certain things have been commit some things haven't been commit and it just yells at you the whole time didn't do it there I've experienced it a lot I know y'all have too it's really cool that Zed does not seem to do that and is like weirdly immediate I don't love this icon what is this move to a new file I don't love that UI don't know what this does or is for it seems like probably one of their weird AI things but can I see if Zed supports Auto rename tag interesting thought let's first off test the typescript go to definition here's our trpc proxy client let's rename symbol to internal API rename no there's no like confirmation button or something I would assume there' be like a button at the bottom here that says go nuts what is this Mt about why why is this upset about the type definitions oh it's the es lint I think the es lint is out of date but the types script isn't because you can see here I have the type definition but eslint is saying it's an unsafe assignment of an any because eslint didn't get the change that we have a different name for this thing internal API now very interesting very interesting I have saved the changes they've been saved in all the files that I did them in so they also get this sync issue in VSS code I get the issue where I have to reset the typescript server but usually the es lint server catches up es lint being broken separately is new to me is there a reset there's restart language server it looks like while I was doing that this corrected itself interesting it might have been because I hadn't opened this file since the change and it was caching that editor level I can't know any of this for sure the goal here is just to like play with it and see which quirks it does or doesn't have if I should actually commit to using this editor for a bit again let me know in the comments and I'll give it a shot for a little longer other people are saying they often have to reset es lint more than they have to reset the typescript server very interesting someone else pointed out it's cool you have es lint support out of the box I absolutely agree having es L to typescript in all of this without any plugins CU like I don't have any plugins installed on this I don't have anything installed right now like here are my settings there's nothing let's try some other fun things more typescript quirks I should be able to command click hello and get to the trpc function in the server folder and it works dope having that type of deep type inference is essential for any editor that I use so if I'm in some client or like user facing code and I want to quickly do anything like I want to just figure out where this is coming from or like make a change to what it's returning having command click working here is huge and the last time I played with a zed this was not working previously it would bring me to weird places in like my type definitions for trpc itself now it actually goes properly all the way to the place where this is written hopefully it still does this on client components one way to test that it still does good stuff should I actually try typing now cuz thus far I have avoided actually editing in the editor let's see how this feels this is a test to see how typing here feels overall I'm impressed the auto comment continuation is also a nice touch I don't know if you guys saw that it's hard see cuz I don't have my key presses on screen but when I press enter it continues the comment for me that's really nice it's doing some type of Auto formatting here too not quite as much as I would have liked but let's see if I tab this out that looks like it's doing pretty your stuff properly Mark pointed out there was a lot of pop-ups when I was typing here when I wasn't typing it in a comment there was but it seems like when I'm in a comment it chills out but when I'm typing here this is a test typing yeah the um the spam of like it trying to autocomplete [ __ ] is a little annoying because it's so fast that it does it quickly but it just it flashes all over the screen when I'm typing like do you see how annoying that is that would piss me off so much I would just add a debounce to that so when I type a letter you don't prompt me with that until I've waited for at least a few milliseconds that I also find this really annoying ESP when I'm making content because I'll be typing something and just my screen's flashing all over the place and it makes the video super distracting so for me in particular that's kind of a no-o yeah also the dialogue should be smaller people are saying it's pretty big I will say I I'm on a 720p effective screen when I'm doing content so I don't know if it's less bad in other cases but now it's taking up a ton of my screen that said VSS code sucks about this too and I type trpc like it still starts to do things but it's nowhere near as brutal about it the jsts server immediately crashed five times great sign responsive test this is me getting a gut feel of the responsiveness in vs code this is me getting a gut feel of responsiveness in said I'll be honest guys doesn't feel much better just typing like that does that come off in the video does this seem faster because it doesn't feel very different to me curious if that Quirk was still happen in comments what happen here I am adding cool it does not so when I press single quote or double quote double quote it will automatically double up but single quote it won't because a single quote might be a contraction but a single quote here doesn't necessarily know that and it always doubles it up so when I'm doing I'm now m is surrounded even though it's in a comment so kind of annoying that when I'm typing a comment I have to go through and delete a bunch of things it's randomly adding for me I'll be honest I've always been annoyed when you make a tag and it autoc closes it for you I don't want that on single Pern in a comment ever but in general I've never been a big fan of it so I am biased there one of the really interesting things that Z's trying to do different is focus on collaboration most editors have some crappy plugin where you can share an instance and I'll be honest every time I tried it was a Jank experience I've never had a good time using VSS code with two people on different computers and usually I just prefer to screen share and Discord or something I am curious how this works with multiple people working in one thing together first off there's a chat which is actually really nice to have a built-in live chat they have a concept of channels where I can create a channel if anybody has Z let's try it we're going to make a t3g channel it wants my microphone is there a way I can mute that oh there it is it's in the top right corner very interesting to have AV built into the editor also a share screen option so I can share my screen Beyond just the editor so if I want to showcase like what I'm actually working on like I want to showcase what the the browser does in the background while I make changes really cool that it supports that can people join the t3g channel is this public or private how does this work cool I trust you Yash I don't want to call you no I sorry I do not think just clicking your name would call that's uh unintended I am sorry I don't know how to stop calling either there's no way to do that remove contact yeah just on a call yeah the UI for this is a little Jank I do not like that I can accidentally call somebody by clicking on their name like call things should should at least have like a separate button for it there's no rightclick Behavior at all like I'm right clicking on people and doesn't do anything I just don't get this join Channel none of these things appear to be doing anything it still has me calling Yash and I don't know how to to stop that does revoke right access do it no share leave call okay that was dumb on the channel invite members oh I can just make it public and now you have been invited aore there's join Channel and open Channel notes okay the channel notes is this thing in the middle here so we can save like a markdown dock notes hi friends aore are you able to edit those notes is this safe though can you run a terminal command fantastic question oh hi from aore hi aore do you have access to my terminal here let me try can't open my terminal can you see what I typed in it though you have your yours open cool um yeah I'm very curious how much you do and do not have you can't even see it interesting I have mixed feelings on this on one hand it's actually pretty cool to think about your coding environment as a a shared collaborative place can you see that you're on your project you already did Z clab at work it's fun oh interesting I have mixed feelings on this it's a really cool idea to have good collaboration tools baked into your editor it gives you a ton of Opp opportunity to innovate in ways like a plugin simply can't and I like the idea that it's not a plugin for this like the vs code live share plugin despite being somewhat baked in is pretty Jank this despite being early and Jank feels like it has more potential to integrate deep in and I am excited to see where it goes but the ux is rough like the fact that when you click someone's name it starts an audio call with them in my editor is terrifying to me I hate that that's that's not something I can support like ever and I will probably be disabling this feature until there's like a major update I want to better understand what the AI autocomplete experience is like oh I can sign in for co-pilot here cool co-pilot is enabled look at that we got co-pilot working dope pump that even though they have aspirations to do their own AI stuff that co-pilot is already built in and working as I would expect that's dope it's nice that I don't feel the need to run and grab any plugins there are little things that I've been using a lot in vs code recently that I like I go through my extensions obviously having language things like um Astro and such is really nice I love cloak for hiding Secrets Dino is nice to have support for directly they already have es lint built in they have co-pilot built in haven't played with their git stuff I'm not a big G in the IDE person but a lot of other people are so that'll be missing which is notable the things I've been thinking about though obviously my themes I love the PO Manders theme it'd be really nice if they had a way to import VSS code themes because it's like a standard-ish syntax somebody will probably hack that or at least make a converter in the future it seems like it's doing all the prettier stuff for me already so that's cool the two I was thinking of the that I'm going to miss are pretty typescript errors and quick lint JS these two plugins are very good I already have a video for pretty typescript errors the typescript just got so much better if you want to know more about the pretty typescript error plug-in check the video out it required a ton of hacks by the dev to make it work but the results super cool and I rely on it a ton you can see here that it will actually make you this nice printed out formatted error thing instead of the absolute mess that typescript normally gives you super super cool and then quick lint if you're not familiar I haven't made a video about this yet it checks for a bunch of basic JavaScript typescript things like using an equals accidentally in an if statement awaiting something that isn't async little type errors that are pretty common and it's super super fast so you get feedback like immediately which is really cool that like on each character you're getting feedback I've been enjoying quick lint quite a bit and again let me know in the comments if I should do a whole video about quick lint because it is a pretty cool project but in order to care about those things we first need to see how Zed handles when you do something wrong so let's spell post wrong how quickly when I add the T will I no longer have a type error pretty quick and if I have the type error and I hover over oh no it's the super unreadable type errors also if you notice I get different type errors depending on how far in I am because these are all accessing an unsafe any I don't know if vs code is smart enough to not do that but there's only one way to check so have here we get the nasty tyri error but then we get the much better formatted error from the Pretty typescript error plugin but over these further down things now this is all the unsafe any yeah so equally bad there but at least I can use my plugin here which I cannot use in Z in my opinion if Zed's goal is to make something better enough than vs code that we all start switching these types of ux wins are a really big thing if you can do them because if you produce enough of these wow moments for a developer that might not know about these plugins might not know about these other things this can be a huge huge win for building like positive sentiment and getting them to go shill it to their friends and getting me to talk really positively about it in a video all those types of things seeing if there is do they have any plugin system at all I don't think they do not upset with it in any way one more thing we should probably test is auto importing what's the I can import okay we have the create post deleting this component deleting the import for this component let's try mounting it now the flash of that is so annoying and also that all these mdn references come up before my own code like I have to press arrow down how many times to get to my thing and also the width of this changes that's Jank that feels not good that all like this UI shifts around as I try to get to the right thing and that what I'm here for is so low priority I have to type the whole word create and even just type in create it still has credentials container canvas capture media and all these other things that don't start with create because the fuzzy search sucks create all those letters are in order in credentials container it has the letters for create in order but something that starts with create should be first for sure this is [ __ ] these are the little things that like are hard to get right that will be fixed over time but feel Jank right now and if the goal of something like Zed is to offer a meaningful user experience improvement over vs code these things matter way way more so that's a little disappointing if I click it did it Auto Import correctly it did cool so at least the auto importing works but the ranking there was terrible I'm happy I checked that one good one is EnV this is a new project so this won't leak anything but it looks like it would have if I hadn't like been sure that it's good ahead of time is that a that's a no co-pilot icon something I have to rely on is the ability to hide secrets with something like cloak because there's nothing worse than accidentally exposing your secrets on stream if I go to here I can turn on cloak and now you'll see all the secrets are hidden very very useful and I try to turn this on before I stream code so that I never accidentally leak environment variables again these things are small but enough of them add up and one of the things you need in order to win with a challenging new product like this is you need to win sentiment from the people who can sprad spread that and share that sentiment so I as a a creator with reach as dumb as it is that I'm saying you should prioritize my quirks and my needs because most users won't benefit that much from having their secrets autohide it makes me more confident when I use it to make content which then reaches the users you want to potentially have this is the thing I've been talking with a lot of companies about especially when I'm Consulting it's the idea that targeting creators despite their weird needs that might not overlap with your users it's actually a really powerful tool to hit product Market fit earlier and get your product in front of others earlier there's two reasons one we have the reach so if we can use the product we'll reach that audience but two and arguably more important if you can't win us you can't win our fans creators and influencers in these spaces especially nowadays deeply understand the things that their viewers and Their audience want to use and work with we might be pickier but we're also more understanding and we're more willing to have these conversations and hear these things out and I've regularly been surprised at how much value I and other creators can bring to companies by giving feedback on the product and why we would or wouldn't use it we are kind of a representative minority of the space because in order for us to get people to watch our videos we have to understand what they like and what they resonate with and with that deeper understanding we're often positioned to to give better feedback and also we spend more time thinking about what our audience would like so if you can't convince us to use your thing despite us having that mindset where we can think kind of the way all of our different viewers think and all the different groups and if you can't convince us that it's good enough for one of those groups it's going to be really hard to convince them yourself so again I feel bad saying make the things creators want but if your target audience is the people who watch those creators making them happy can help a ton I will say I'm impressed especially when you consider that they don't get to lean on much existing work here like they have treesitter in fact the treesitter devs are some of the core team for Zed they have the typescript language server running in the background and allowing them to get all the data they need here but they are missing a lot of the pieces that exist because of the size of the existing VSS code and JavaScript ecosystem like another thing people just brought up is the Tailwind auto complete oh wow looks like they hardcoded the Tailwind auto complete in it's PT this I don't love like weird things get mixed into the autocomplete but at least that works does it have the hover to see the actual CSS that applies it does not interesting and does the prettier organizer organize things correctly it does not okay so this is again like because they can't lean on the existing tools they have to build their own versions of it so we do get a lot of the Tailwind autocomplete help here which is really nice like I can Tailwind like group or Tailwind like lgp whatever and it's smart enough to know what that is but it doesn't let me hover over to see what these things are versus in VSS code I hover over one of these and tells me the exact class there another thing it doesn't seem to support that I push really hard is the auto sorting prettier plugin for tailin which makes your tailin code way more readable because everything's in the same order I intentionally put this padding too far forward because now when I save it's going to get moved to the right spot which is in this Chunk in either the middle or the end depending on which classes you have that has all the padding behaviors I've learned this order it's really good the prettier Auto sort Tailwind plugin is dope and I genuinely think everyone should be using it if they're using Tailwind so not having that sucks because they didn't Implement prettier bindings they implemented a bunch of prettier functionality into their editor they didn't implement the Tailwind plugin they implemented a bunch of Tailwind functionality into the editor this is also why open sourcing is so important because if they didn't open source building and maintaining all of these things becomes really really difficult really really quickly and I'm hopeful that the choice to open source will make it more likely the community supports these things going forward that said if the Tailwind stuff is written rust I'm curious to see how that goes we can check the source code quick though interesting they have the tail and prettier plug-in package it should work then although if you think about it it's pretty wild to see tailwind and prettier in the source code of Zed especially when you compare to like the vs code GitHub if we search in here for Tailwind nothing search in here for pretty a they might use it but it's not part of vs code itself because these are all plugins that are external extensions whereas with zed these are all built-in features and rust I don't necessarily love this but open sourcing is a huge step in making future extensions that are more usable also how hilarious is it that Tailwinds considered a language the point stands having to support things that deeply in your editor is a scary thought and the amount of work that the poor Zed team has had to do to create all of these bindings is a little terrifying oh no oh no I see what they're doing since Tailwind is a subset language not a proper Lang language which obviously Tailwind is not a programming language in order to get their auto complete in their adapter working in all the other places you might use Tailwind they had to manually bind the Tailwind parser to every language you might use Tailwind with including we not limited to CSS Elixir heeks hex I've no idea what heex is TSX JavaScript HTML Erb spelt PHP and more referen coming up there but yeah the fact that they have to bind Tailwind hardcoded to every single language for it to work is incredibly not extensible and again with like not having plugin support for other things like Tailwind to exist or for Tailwind changes to happen or God forbid Tailwind version 4 has different classes than Tailwind version 3 you're [ __ ] the fact that these language parsers have to have such weird additional assignments made for it to work is scary also like the first line in the language in nit is an Elixir settings register so Elixir has to do some special things and they always run this code even if you're not using Elixir so these types of hacks are necessary when you don't have a plugin system and they're a little scary that said they did just open source this code and I'm not here to just [ __ ] on people's code like this isn't bad code it's scary to maintain as an open source project and that's a thing we should think about and be honest about they do have a plugins directory interesting for child and children if okay path child path config read language config if it matches then they register it enter interesting yeah and they're registering it through a wasm layer too that means they can safely run rust code in like a virtualization layer and also they can run other languages including JavaScript and typescript this is very interesting how this is architected I'm even more excited about reading through how that rewrite worked so again let me know in the comments if I should make a video about the whole rewrite the file for all the language support including loading plugins is under 300 lines of code that's not too bad and enough you pointed out that GPI is cool that I'll quickly touch on it it is actually really interesting the goal of GPI is to do a GPU accelerated UI framework written in Rust so that you have rust code that runs native UI there hasn't really been anything like this before at least that I know of they've stated a lot of their goals here and actually really surprised the quality of what they've written here they point out there three different registers that they've created depending on the way you want to build this UI interesting this is Swift UI I know most of y'all aren't Swift UI users but this is Swift UI this is the Swift UI sytax look familiar yeah that is fascinating to me I haven't talked much about Swift UI and I have a lot of opinions but I think they they took the right lessons from react and it is interesting to see other things doing it I am very curious about the decision to use div here as the example is Zed using a web container that's rendering divs or are they rendering native UI wasum is not a UI layer it has like if this is running in a browser shell this is would be wum doesn't I don't care about how where it's running I care about what it's rendering to does this render to some type of extension of a canvas or a dawn or is this making native UI with like GPU calls cuz they pointed out that it's GPU accelerated a GPU accelerated UI framework for rust create a new window with app context open window and register your first view there is nowhere near enough info here seems like it's running native I'm very confused by the choice of using a div in their example because if you're deep enough in web that you don't know this divs are a web concept even react native doesn't have a div like if you write react native code you cannot render a div in it you have to render a react native view or text element leveraging rust in the GPU to render user interface at 12 FPS they're calling out my concern if like divs are slow because you're doing the web layer good old Evan Wallace code if you don't know Evan Wallace he also created es build this dude is like the JavaScript and JavaScript accessories performance wizard yall remember in my recent video where I said game devs don't appreciate the web and US finding new ways to render and render because they're still trying to get text to render and a bunch of people in the comments were like you don't know anything about Native devs and like performant Dev if you think we don't know how to R text or you think that's hard to do here's a five page section on why it's not that easy to render text you stupid [ __ ] I'm sorry but like if you're building native stuff and you're trying to build native stuff for performance reasons you do have to care about how text renders and as you see here it is not easy to do they also cited the Pathfinder crate which seems to be the existing rust UI rasterization layer that they didn't think was good enough for their needs fascinating this is proof they're actually doing native code code they're not doing things in the browser which makes me really confused about the choice to have like div and flex all in their example because div and flex are both very Web Concepts as well as justify Center item Center all these things are very Webby if you have the opportunity to build something new from scratch I'm a little confused why you'd bring the web Primitives somebody said they just picked the name div instead of View kind of but they also picked Flex they also picked justify Center and item Center they're taking a lot of the way we do things in web which is very interesting and not necessary react native took very little from web they took a bit but not a lot and even things like Flex they they tried to take but they they built them differently like it's a silly thing but a really interesting example of how react native differs from react for web by default react web Flex boxes are horizontal and you have to specify B vertical react native Flex boxes are default vertical you have to specify horizontal it's a small detail but these things add up as you swap between platforms a lot I'm interested in why they chose to go the web Direction here there's a lot going on in this project and I'm really curious to see where it goes from the Native layer and rust for the GPU stuff to everything they're doing with collab and AI there's an interesting thing going on here and I'm really excited that it's not just happening but it's now open source I don't see myself leaving vs code anytime soon but I am excited for a future where there's more competition and more Innovation happening within our editors what about you do you still use vs code have you made the switch over to Vim or are you one of the few remaining Sublime Text holdouts that just won't move yet I'd love to hear what you're using if you want to see me make vs code even worse I have a great video in the corner here where I let chat decide what I would do to my vs code and I promise you it's terrible see you guys in the next one appreciate you all a ton peace NS"
