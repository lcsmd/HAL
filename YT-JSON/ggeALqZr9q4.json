        "transcript": "all right good afternoon everyone hope uh that everyone's doing well and avoiding the coronavirus today we're going to talk a little bit about peripheral neuropathy i have some questions that were submitted previously anybody who's watching or following along is is free to to add questions um in the the ticker there and i'll try and get to those at the end of the discussion i thought what i would do is um anybody who's at home or around a computer or even on their smartphone whatever um i'm just gonna use the the web page from the mayo clinic uh so if you just type in peripheral neuropathy definition or mayo clinic peripheral neuropathy or something like that you will uh be brought to that page and um i'm just going to use that sort of as a template for our discussion um there's a lot of information on here that's good and and correct and then i'll be able to add some additional information with regards to peripheral nerve surgery and how that can be an effective treatment for certain patients who suffer from peripheral neuropathy so um maybe the first thing we should start with is a definition of peripheral neuropathy like a lot of words in medicine the the two words put together peripheral neuropathy can mean different things to different people at a very basic level any kind of a nerve problem could be described as quote unquote peripheral neuropathy however the most by far the most common understanding of that term if you use it to a doctor or even more generally amongst patients what they're going to understand is peripheral neuropathy i.e the condition that usually affects both legs and feet or sometimes the hands and the feet and if you're diabetic then they'll term it diabetic peripheral neuropathy if you have an underlying diabetic medical condition if you if you if there's if you're not diabetic basically then you're going to fall into the other categorization which is idiopathic peripheral neuropathy and idiopathic is just a latin term for we don't know what the cause is so but we don't like to say that as doctors so we we use idiopathic um so that's sort of a basic definition of peripheral neuropathy there's it can really be applied to any kind of nerve problem but in more common parlance you know most of most of the time when you use the phrase peripheral neuropathy people are going to understand you to mean the type of condition that diabetics or others will develop where they have pain numbness etc involving their feet or their hands and their feet i would say it's more commonly present in the lower extremities although not infrequent in the upper extremities um nerve compression syndromes are much more commonly recognized in the upper extremities so it could be that patients are less likely to be diagnosed as having quote unquote peripheral neuropathy and more likely to be diagnosed with having mechanical nerve compressions and have surgery and have that problem relieved in the upper extremities than they are in the lower extremities um part of that is because things like carpal tunnel syndrome and cubital tunnel syndrome have been long recognized as affecting the hands and arms whereas the idea that you can have nerves compressed in the lower extremities is much much well less thought of or thought about by both patients and doctors um i think it would also be helpful to maybe define the anatomy a little bit when you're talking about the nervous system in general first of all you break it down into two main categories you have the central nervous system which is made up of the brain and the spinal cord and the nerve roots which is the nerve tissue that comes directly off the spinal cord and resides within the bony spine um once once nerves leave the skull base or the bony spine then they become peripheral nerves and so all the other nerves in your body away from the skull or the spine are make up what's called the peripheral nervous system so you have central nervous system brain and spine and peripheral nervous system all the other nerves in the body essentially and then when you talk about the peripheral nervous system you can break it down into somatic and autonomic somatic is the voluntary nerves so like when you think about moving your arm and your arm moves or you grab something those are those are somatic nerves usually in involved in um moving parts of your body and they they and that part of the system is made up of both sensory nerves and motor nerves so the motor nerves are where it goes some muscle sensory nerves can go to skin other structures within the skin joints etc and within the autonomic nervous system um that's your your fight or flight nerves and most relevant to our discussion will be the sympathetic um component of the autonomic nervous system there's sympathetic parasympathetic and enteric but for our for the purpose of discussion today this the sympathetic is what's most important and that's the part of the nervous system as we talked about that can be involved in in the clinical manifestations that you see in patients with crps but also patients with peripheral neuropathy where you you may get excessive dryness of skin or excessive sweating of skin the color changes that can happen in the feet or the hands where they go red or dark purpley blue those kind of things those are those are inappropriate nerve signals being mediated by the sympathetic nervous system so that's kind of the anatomy when we're talking about the type of nerves that that i deal with as a chronic pain focus peripheral nervous chronic pain focus peripheral nerve surgeon we're talking mainly about uh those nerves that are that fall under the category of somatic nerves those are the ones that you can actually find and operate on and manipulate to relieve pain and or restore sensation and improve strength etc so looking at this uh description on the mayo clinic website they start off with symptoms um you know what are the symptoms of somebody who has peripheral neuropathy well obviously the symptom that um [Music] gets everybody's attention is the pain peripheral peripheral nerves the nerves that i deal with sort of have three main functions one is the perception of pain uh the second one is movement you know the nerves innervate a muscle and cause it to contract and the third is sensation like sensation to a joint sensation of a piece of skin in a certain location of the body etc and so if you think about those three functions pain movement and sensation these these types of nerve fibers can all run together the closer a nerve is to the spine the more likely it is that you're dealing with a mixed nerve a nerve that has you know both sensory which includes sensation and pain and motor function so you call those nerves mixed motor sensory nerves the further away you get from the spine the more likely you are or or maybe another way of thinking about is the smaller the nerve branch the more likely you will be to be dealing with a purely motor nerve although there are some sensory fibers in motor nerves but in terms of function it goes and innervates a muscle or a purely sensory nerve which has no motor function in it a useful way to think about peripheral nerves for example let's take the sciatic nerve we talked about that that nerve when we addressed the sciatica issue in the first video but if you think about the sciatic nerve the trunk it's like an upside down tree in your leg with the trunk part being deep in the deep gluteal space underneath the big butt muscle and then as that nerve travels down your leg it's like it's literally like think of yourself standing on an upside down tree branches are coming off and the the main core trunk is getting smaller and as as you get further and further down to the toes you're having smaller and smaller branches coming off going to joints going to muscles doing whatever they're supposed to do so that's kind of you know a visual of what the actual anatomy is like in nerves as they travel from the spine to the periphery or you know to fingertips or toes so when when when a peripheral nerve is in trouble symptoms will depend partly on what level the problem is at so or or another way to think of that is what type of nerves are involved if if the point of compression let's say is high enough that it involves motor and sensory nerves then you could have all three symptoms you could have pain you could have loss of sensation and you could have some kind of motor or muscle weakness if the nerve is simply a sensory nerve then you're then you're typically going to only get pain and some type of sensory loss or numbness or something like that and sometimes if the nerve is sim is mainly motor you may not have much in the way of sensory problems or pain you may just have weakness in sometimes in larger nerves that are both sensory and motor because the nerve is a three-dimensional structure and because pressure being applied to an earth sometimes affects one side of the nerve more than the other side in those situations sometimes it it [Music] what can happen is you may only get predominantly motor fibers affected or predominantly sensory fibers affected so that the clinical picture will be one that's more predominantly pain with maybe a little bit of weakness or just weakness with no pain at all or maybe weakness with some numbness or sensory loss but no real pain so there can be quite a variation of presentation and combination of presentations when you think about those those three major groups of function of the nerves when a nerve is in trouble in terms of uh so let's go back to this mayo website here you know uh symptoms some of the signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy so you can get the numbness sometimes you get things like pins and needles sometimes it involves loss of sensation that is not perceived as you know my foot is numb per se or pins and needles the patient will often tell you that you know if you ask them do you have any loss of sensation in your foot for example they'll say no my foot feels normal but if you test them with two-point discrimination they will actually show a degree of sensory loss but it's it's the type of loss of sensation that doesn't involve numbness or a tingling or pins and needle sensations so they are really not aware of it until their balance may start to be affected or something like that um in terms of you know when when a motor nerve is involved that's just going to present as some degree of weakness in the muscle that's affected in terms of pain this is where you can get a real variety of types of pain a lot of people are under the misconception that if it's a nerve problem the pain has to have a burning quality that's absolutely false if you if you think of literally any um sensation that you're capable of experiencing whether it's you know a live ember falling on your skin your hand being put in a bucket of ice water a bug crawling across your hand a match being lit and put against your skin like any of those sensations can be reproduced by somebody who has a peripheral nerve problem it's commonly a burning sensation but it could be a severe aching sensation it could be um a sharp stabbing pain it could feel like a pressure pain or like something is pulling something apart pain like literally and then a lot of people who have who are experiencing nerve pain really can struggle to actually find uh the words to describe the pain it's like it could be something that they really have never experienced before and don't really have the language to describe so it can be very very strange sensations as well um and apart from pain and apart from weakness and apart from numbness there can also be a lot of weird sensations that aren't necessarily painful but they could be aggravating or disturbing things like you know bugs crawling across your skin or a sensation of a limb being very heavy or tired and and this may not have anything to do with the muscles really but this sense of weight or tiredness can all be sort of a trick that's being played on your brain because of the signals that are being generated by the peripheral nerve that may be damaged or under pressure or something like that as i mentioned before you know most of what i deal with is the somatic part of the peripheral nervous system the the nerves that um move muscles and and supply sensation to the skin and all that but if you have the the sympathetic nerves involved this is where you can sometimes have things like the the color changes the um excessive sweating the dry skin all those kind of things um the next section on the mayo clinic website talks about causes and you know this is an area where nothing is really defined most of these quote unquote causes are more like associated risk factors probably the the most studied one is diabetes but there can be other autoimmune diseases infections there can be inherited types of peripheral neuropathy [Music] just many many different things anything that applies pressure to a nerve can cause peripheral neuropathy other other examples they give here are things like alcoholism exposure to um certain poisons or toxins or chemicals sometimes industry in the industrial environment or that kind of thing um and again they list causes of just about any cause that could cause sort of the generic meaning of peripheral neuropathy but when you're talking about sort of that the type of patient that would fall in the category of a diabetic peripheral neuropathy most of the time in terms of associated risk factors you're dealing with somebody who's got diabetes or if they're idiopathic neuropathy it's somebody who will often have hypothyroidism and usually uh or it's much more common in women but you know people who've had chemotherapy or been exposed to certain toxins or other chemicals um you know those are going to be the ones that the history that you have in patients who who have sort of the more specific type of peripheral neuropathy meaning numbness tingling pain in the hands or feet or both and actually probably the the largest single group of patients would be that component of the idiopathic neuropathy group which doesn't really have any known or identifiable risk factor so they're not they're not obviously not diabetic but they're not hypothyroid and they don't have any of the other sort of common uh risk factors that you might see so and really when when it comes down to sort of trying to figure out the cause of peripheral neuropathy most of the time that's just an exercise in frustration and there's no real way to prove one thing or another unless unless you're diabetic but even then even if you're diabetic and you become and you develop neuropathy symptoms it doesn't necessarily mean that it's the diabetes that caused it some people with diabetic diabetes don't ever go on to develop peripheral neuropathy probably about 30 or so never have peripheral neuropathy or any type of neuropathy problems and other people can you know based on the history they develop their peripheral neuropathy when they're 50 and then when they're 70 they develop diabetes so it's not a hard and fast like cause of peripheral neuropathy it goes through risk factors and complications one of the big complications of peripheral neuropathy especially in the lower extremities is that it can lead to amputation that's really the the big one i would say um in patients who have peripheral neuropathy and who develop significant sensory loss that's usually the reason why they don't they go on to develop uh the need for an amputation it's it's it's a minority of situations where it's actually poor blood flow that results in the need for an amputation or you know they develop sort of that black gangrene because they just have no blood flow to the limb and therefore they need to have it amputated in most patients who with peripheral neuropathy either diabetic or idiopathic who go on to develop a situation where they require the amputation of a limb it's because they developed such dense numbness that then they were at they were susceptible to developing some kind of chronic wound that then leads to a bone infection called osteomyelitis which can be very difficult to treat other than by amputation and sometimes that can flare up into a wet gangrene which is can be a life-threatening situation to require you know sort of a an emergent amputation so one of the important things about trying to either preventing if you can or addressing the lost sensation through nerve surgery is that it really essentially reduces that risk of an amputation almost to zero so that's an important point you know a lot of a lot of what the mayo clinic site talks about is managing conditions or or prevention and you can do to some degree you know if you're a diabetic and you eat perfectly and watch your weight and all that it does decrease your risk but it doesn't completely take it away you know there's been studies where they've had patients with diabetes who have managed their diabetes just to perfection and still some of those will some of those patients will develop um peripheral neuropathy so um in terms of diagnosing peripheral neuropathy this is kind of one that i chuckle about a little bit because very often patients who come who finally find me who have significant peripheral neuropathy symptoms may have had four or five or more emg nerve conduction studies they get these big workups by neurologists and i do think it's appropriate if you're your first time to rule out easily treatable things like a vitamin b deficiency or something like that but that applies to a very small minority of patients especially in the west where we typically don't have vitamin deficiencies unless specific situations arise i mean if somebody sits down in front of you and says yeah my feet are numb and they burn or tingle or whatever i mean they have peripheral neuropathy there's you don't really even need to do these emg nerve conduction studies almost always in the setting of sort of classic clinical symptoms of peripheral neuropathy an emg will just come back saying yep you got peripheral neuropathy they are uniformly bad at actually identifying the presence of underlying compression neuropathies and so you know they're not pleasant for the patient and they usually don't add anything to the diagnosis that you can't make just from listening to the patient for five seconds so in patients with peripheral neuropathy i never get emg nerve conduction studies because they're they're not really relevant or useful and they're fairly uncomfortable um you know again just to reiterate in somebody who's developing or experiencing peripheral neuropathy symptoms for the first time i do think it's it's valuable to go see you know either their doctor or a neurologist and have a good work up for some of the conditions the medical conditions that could be if treated appropriately could reverse those symptoms and to be honest i think most people do do that because that's how the system is designed so anybody who goes to their doctor or their neurologist and complains of these classic neuropathy symptoms are going to get put through the whole gamut the whole work up for you know things like a vitamin b deficiency or whatever but the problem is that only a very small percentage of patients with these symptoms actually have a problem that's treatable and so then they go on to be coming a patient who has peripheral neuropathy so in terms of treatment um you know it sort of comes down to pain medications or and and those will be things like percocet and norco etc sort of the the common run-of-the-mill opioid-based pain medication they would give somebody for who had an arthritic knee or whatever there's also another class of medication that is used to try and treat the pain and these are these are broadly termed neuropathic pain medications these are things like your gabapentin um cymbalta lyrica and you know there's there's always ones coming on the market in my experience a very small minority of patients get really good relief with one of those drugs and at the same time don't have side effects that are so severe they can continue on with that drug so i think it is worthwhile to try these drugs initially and see what your response is i would say though that probably 90 to 95 percent of people who have significant neuropathy symptoms who get put on one of these drugs fall into one of two categories the first is that um you know they have some incremental improvement in their symptoms on the drug so meaning like if you're taking your gabapentin you might have 10 to 15 percent less pain than your than if you're not taking it the problem is that for most of these patients they're still suffering so horribly on the gabapentin that it's only when they go off it that they realize it's actually a little bit worse off it but either often or on it their quality of life is horrible and then the other half the other category would be patients who are on it but it doesn't do a darn thing for so i would say that's probably even between people it doesn't do anything for it and people it does a slight a bit of improvement for and then a very small percentage of those patients have really great results being on something like a galapagos and also don't have side effects that are so severe that they can't tolerate the drug because of the side effects and that's actually worse than the neuropathy problem to begin with um it's it's interesting how many times i see patients who are on one of these drugs and i ask them well you know have you noticed any improvements since you've been on they'd be like no but yeah they their doctors keep them on it for months or years even even when it you know hasn't done anything at all for them um and so what ends up happening a lot of times especially in patients who have a very painful form of neuropathy is that they're on you know some kind of opioid narcotic a gabapentin they're still suffering horribly from the pain and they're dealing with all the side effects the central nervous system side effects the grogginess the sleepiness the nausea the constipation and all that from the drugs so it's really kind of sad for a lot of these patients when it comes down to treatment um you know there's things that you can do and there's a lot of snake oil out there in the peripheral neuropathy world in terms of people promising people that their neuropathy can be cured by shining lights of various colors on them or putting 10 units on them etcetera etcetera physical therapy chiropractic you know maneuvers or treatments almost always these types of treatments may make the patient feel good while it's while they're undergoing the treatment but once they leave the office or whatever all their pain is essentially back for patients who may have an immune mediated type of peripheral neuropathy sometimes infusions of ivig or other types of plasma exchange and whatnot can be quite effective at helping those types of patients but again that's a small minority of patients compared to the you know the the main pool of people will suffer from peripheral neuropathy so that brings us to uh surgery um you know how does surgery or what role does can surgery play in patients who have peripheral neuropathy so surgery is a form of treatment for peripheral neuropathy especially when you're talking about like the diabetic peripheral neuropathy or idiopathic peripheral neuropathy is a very new radical concept to most of the medical community the the dogmatic view of peripheral neuropathy [Music] since forever has been basically that there's no it's a medical condition and there's no role for surgery it's a um a progressive incurable condition that you can really only hope to manage versus actually cure so i think in order to get a a good understanding of why surgery is effective in the patients that it is effective in and we'll talk about the success rate as well but it's important to understand what's actually happening inside the body and this is one that one advantage that i as a chronic pain focus peripheral nerve surgeon have over say a neurologist or a patient's medical doctor they sort of i always analogize this to a to a mechanic it's like a mechanic that's never opened the hood of the car they don't really know what's going on inside so it's very hard to diagnose things and and impossible to really do anything if you're not at the root of the problem so just sort of as a to give you a basic understanding of the problem in patients who respond to surgery who have peripheral neuropathy what's typically happening is there's a couple of layers to the problem think of it like a two layer cake so the first layer of the cake is can be whatever the metabolic issue is whether it's diabetes or hypothyroidism or maybe exposure to some kind of a toxin or chemical or previous chemotherapy what have you very often it's impossible to really identify what that first layer the cake is the second layer of the cake is there because what happens to nerves and again so maybe let me back up for a second if those of you who are old enough will remember those coke pepsi challenges where somebody would take a drink of coke and somebody take a drink of the pepsi and be blinded and they wouldn't know which one is which as a surgeon when you operate on somebody who has um peripheral neuropathy it doesn't matter if they if they're if they have diabetes in their medical history or hypothyroidism or no known risk factor the nerves look identical they're all swollen they're all infiltrated with fatty tissue and surrounded with fatty tissue and so whether you can identify the first layer of the cake or not is not that important what's what's crucial in terms of whether a patient is a candidate for surgery to try and relieve the symptoms of their peripheral neuropathy is do they demonstrate evidence of mechanical nerve compression when you examine them physically and when i say mechanical nerve compression terms like pinched nerves or entrapped nerves that all means the same it means that the tissue around the nerve is putting pressure on the nerve now this happens in only in certain defined places in the body um if you think about uh you know if you if you look at the walls in the room that you're in you have you probably some dry wall up if you're able to just sort of remove the drywall what you'd see is the the two before studs and you'd see the wiring in the wall and you would notice that um in between the two by four studs there's a lot of space around the wires there's just maybe some soft insulation nothing really tight where the wire has to pass through a 2x4 stud there's usually a a fairly small hole that's been drilled and and the bundle of wires has to sort of compact down and pass through that hole in the two before stud before it can pass into the next wide open space and this is sort of like the the nerves in your body are a very good way to think about them is that's the electrical wiring in your body just like the electrical wiring your house passes through all these tight spaces at certain locations so do the nerves in your body these tight spaces often occur around joints and um so what can happen is you know when you when you're a young kid or when your nerves are not a problem the nerves tend to fit appropriately in these spaces and they're able to glide back and forth and everything's fine what happened what happens to the nerves because of that first layer of the cake whether it's the diabetes or whatever the nerve tends to start to swell it starts to develop fat tissue inside the nerve and surrounding the nerve and so if you think of like um you know just just taking your wedding band or a ring that fits on your ring finger if you if you take that ring off and you slide it over your little finger you'll see that there's a little bit of room everywhere but the little finger fits good even your ring finger fits okay because you can get it on and off if you try to take that ring and put it on your thumb you'll immediately recognize you know you can probably get it on halfway down to the first joint of the thumb but you'll see that the tissue is kind of squeezed where it passes through the the ring and this is sort of what happens to peripheral nerves when they swell up like a balloon if you think if you take a balloon and thread it through a napkin ring you start to blow it up you know at first it fits just fine but after a while as the diameter of the balloon increases that napkin ring starts to act as a as a compression point on the on the balloon and that's essentially what's happening to peripheral nerves as they become swollen and infiltrated with fatty tissue the tight space that they used to fit in doesn't increase in size to accommodate the increased volume of the nerve and so that tight space will start acting as a compression point on the nerve and it's actually that pressure on the nerve that produces the clinical symptoms that everybody thinks of as this medical condition called peripheral neuropathy the probably the best known example of a peripheral nerve compression would be carpal tunnel syndrome which is where the median nerve is compressed right at the base of the palm wrist area you know people get that a lot when they've been typing or using computers a lot etc and and so the carpal tunnel is a tight anatomic space the median nerve has to pass through there whatever set of circumstances whether the nerve swells or in a traumatic in a situation if the the volume of that space is reduced for any reason it starts to put pressure on the nerve and then the patient develops pain numbness tingling etc in in the four fingers of the hand excluding the small finger typically so the same thing can happen in the lower extremities and the thing about the thing that i think made it hard to recognize patients with peripheral neuropathy is also having mechanical nerve compressions is because it affects multiple nerves at multiple levels and so what this does is give that the classic the way they describe it to you when you're in medical school as the stalking glove distribution so very often patients who have peripheral neuropathy symptoms the pain and the numbness if you put on a pair of crew socks or even knee-high socks and a pair of gloves where where the socks and the gloves cover your hands and feet are typically the distribution that you'll get these symptoms in and it was thought because the symptoms were sort of globally distributed and not in a specific anatomic nerve that this couldn't be the type of peripheral nerve problem that could lend itself to surgical treatment and if you couple this with the general ignorance amongst physicians about peripheral nerve anatomy you know it was no wonder that it sort of evolved to be considered a medical condition for which you could only treat it medically and that there was no role for surgery but in someone who has peripheral neuropathy who undergoes a comprehensive peripheral nerve examination by somebody who knows where all these potential compression points are located and can examine the patient for that and that exam is done as a combination of a very careful examination of the motor or muscles because if you think back to what we started talking about at first if a muscle is weak and you know the nerve anatomy very well you know which nerve innervates that muscle and then you automatically know that what levels that nerve may be compromised at uh to produce the weakness at that location um and it's all very anatomy-based and very logical and so you can go through a methodical careful uh peripheral nerve evaluation and and see just based on the motor exam alone you can get a good idea of where a problem might might lie based on which nerves at which level excuse me which muscles at which level are affected so the first part of any good peripheral nerve examination involves a careful motor examination and then the other part is really examining the peripheral nerves themselves and testing by physical examination at these potential anatomic tight spaces if the nerve actually demonstrates signs of compression or not you can have often a very good idea of whether what you're going to find even before you examine the nerves based on what the patient tells you in terms of their clinical symptoms so if somebody has pain and numbness on the top of their foot but not on the bottom of their foot then you know you're you're automatically going to be expecting to find something affecting the common perineal nerve system or nerves downstream from from the lateral knee area if you find somebody with weakness when they bend their knees so meaning their hamstrings are weak then now you're looking at for a lesion that's much higher up either at the buttock level or possibly the spine and that's why it's always important in patients with symptoms up that high to evaluate and rule out the lumbar spine but for most people who have the classic peripheral neuropathy their symptoms are mainly going to be from the knee down and it's especially sort of mid lower leg down into the foot or if they have it in the upper extremities it's going to involve more the hands or maybe some of the forearms and hands and if you're dealing with somebody with those kind of symptoms especially if they're sort of symmetric and in bilateral which is sort of part of the classic definition of a peripheral neuropathy patient you would expect to and somebody who only has these kind of symptoms in one hand or one foot you're much more likely to be dealing with somebody who's had some kind of surgical insult or traumatic injury which has then led to nerve problems in somebody who has some kind of underlying metabolic problem that has led to the development of more global nerve compressions you're typically typically going to see symptoms that are often symmetric and affect both the left and the right foot for example however when peripheral nerve problems start they may not start the same and be symmetric on both sides so it's very common that somebody who develops peripheral neuropathy may first notice the problem in the right foot for example and maybe it affects the right foot only for six months or even a year or some period of time and then they start to have similar symptoms develop in the left foot and usually over a period of months or years they sort of even out so the symptoms are the same on both sides but it can be that you have one side that's more severely affected than the other that's very common so peripheral neuropathy can be the exact same symptoms on both sides or one can be more severe than the other if you're dealing though with somebody who only has one side affected you're much less likely to be dealing with a metabolic issue like a diabetic or somebody with hypothyroidism and much more likely to be dealing with somebody who may have had a traumatic injury of some type or maybe a surgical procedure that affected the nerves only in one leg um so let's talk a little bit about who's a candidate for surgery you know amongst the pool of patients that have peripheral neuropathy have been diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy who is a good candidate for surgery um so really it's the physical examination that determines that so this isn't it's not it's it's not the case that surgery is recommended for anyone with peripheral neuropathy anyone with peripheral neuropathy is certainly a candidate to undergo a peripheral nerve evaluation because an emg nerve conduction study won't give you any useful nation about useful information about are you a good surgery candidate or not so everybody you know can have a peripheral nerve evaluation which doesn't involve sticking needles or electrocuting you or shocking you any way it's it can be uncomfortable just by pushing on the nerves that are compressed but it's not as bad as an emg nerve conduction study of the patients who undergo a peripheral a comprehensive peripheral nerve evaluation only those patients who demonstrate fairly clear evidence of an underlying or maybe a better word is a superimposed mechanical nerve compression so you have your first layer of the cake which is your diabetes for example and then superimposed on top of that is the second layer which is the mechanical compression of the nerve so only those patients with peripheral neuropathy who also demonstrate evidence of peripheral nerve compression or mechanical compression of the nerves on physical examination then clear the hurdle to be considered a good candidate for surgery now if you take the group of patients who have passed their physical exam if you will and show signs of peripheral nerve compression they are then considered candidates for surgery however the success rate of surgery is still only about 80 now those are sort of the the published figures from multiple studies that have been done first by dr don who's my mentor who trained me but other investigators around the around the world now have reproduced these results so this the standard answer is generally considered to be about 80 percent success rate so what does what does success so that means 80 percent of people will have a successful outcome from surgery and about 20 percent of people will not have a successful outcome from surgery so what is how do you define success in failure the 20 percent of people who do not have a good outcome with peripheral nerve surgery for peripheral neuropathy um typically are no worse so the surgery doesn't make them worse it just doesn't make them better when they're done healing up from their surgical wounds etc they're basically going to be right where they were before surgery on the other hand the 80 who do have a good outcome it's usually a very very good outcome meaning complete resolution of pain and near or complete resolution or restoration of normal sensation and they get rid of the numbness and stuff sometimes you can get a partial response and that typically looks like resolution of pain but maybe not great recovery of sensation so the patient will their pain will be gone but their numbness remains and a lot of that i think has to do with how long the patient has had the peripheral neuropathy symptoms to begin with so the longer it goes if you've had really horrible dense numbness for 10 15 years your chances of having excellent return of sensation are certainly diminished if you're still having a lot of pain there's still it and you have a good physical exam there's still great chance of the pain being relieved but sometimes in those patients that have had peripheral neuropathy for a long time the sensation the return of sensation is not great um so that sort of speaks to the point that for people who have been diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy it's it's better to be evaluated for surgery earlier rather than later because the longer the mechanical compression or pressure on the nerve is present the more damage it can do to the nerve and the more damage it does to the nerve the longer it can take to recover or in in some cases where the the compression has been there for years there may not be a full recovery from that so again just to sort of summarize the success rate of surgery is about 80 that means there's a 20 failure rate in the group that has a good result um it's usually an excellent result meaning essentially complete or total resolution of their symptoms now another important important point to bring up is you know so if i have a good result on my left leg what are the odds of having a good result on my right leg so it turns out and this is you know i've seen patients who've come to me from other people who've tried doing this type of surgery for neuropathy and and you know i talked to them and they haven't had a good result but they've had both legs operated on and i talked and i say well you know it was a sequence of events there and so they had surgery and weren't better and six weeks later the surgeon operate on the other leg which is completely unethical and wrong to do if you if you fail surgery meaning you have your first operation and you end up being in that 20 category that didn't respond well to the nerve decompression surgery then then you don't do any more surgery for that patient because you've proven that they're not going to respond simply to decompressing the nerves and that's that's one thing that we don't really understand as to you know why are there those 20 percent of patients just don't respond i think in some situations some of it can be because there's more proximal nerve compressions i.e piriformis syndrome or something like that can that can be involved but there's certainly also you know the majority of that 20 we just don't understand why that's the case so if you're if you if you don't have a good result with the first surgery you should not have any more surgery period because it won't you know if you operate on the other leg it's not like you have an 80 chance of doing well and only a 20 chance of failure on the other leg it's 100 chance of failure essentially conversely by that same token if you do well with the first surgery so you had an 80 chance of doing well and you had your first surgery and you've had relief of symptoms within the anatomic territory of those nerves then any additional surgery that you might need your success rate goes up to close to 100 percent you know if we could pick out the patients that we knew were going to respond then the success rate of the first surgery would be 100 and failure rate be zero percent but we don't know and that's why there's that 80 20 with the first surgery any surgery after the first surgery is either going to be 100 failure rate in which case you shouldn't do it or close to 100 percent uh success rate with sometimes partial responses as i explained before um so i think that more or less covers everything there is to know about peripheral neuropathy um maybe i should go back and just summarize a little bit you know the majority the majority of uh doctors and patients labor under the false impression that there's really nothing substantial you can do for peripheral neuropathy it's considered a medical condition and you're only really able to treat it with either um you know medic medication pain medication or these neuropathic pain drugs and then there's you know for certain specific things you might be able to take a vitamin supplement and get rid of it but essentially for the vast majority of patients is really not cure is not ever in the discussion it's more trying to manage and tolerate the symptoms the new treatment on the horizon for patients with peripheral neuropathy is actually identifying those patients who who show evidence of nerve compression and in that group in that subgroup of patients operating on them and decompressing the nerves can can essentially provide a cure in about 20 percent of patients what that means is it's not it's not really the underlying metabolic problem it's not really the diabetes in most patients or the hypothyroidism or whatever unidentifiable condition they have that's causing problems with the nerves it's the mechanical compression that the second layer that's causing the clinical symptoms so on somebody who has peripheral neuropathy and complaining of numbness and burning in their feet those symptoms are due to the pressure on the nerve not the fact that the nerve is swollen and infiltrated with fat to begin with and that's the key understanding and so if you have somebody who can identify where these nerve compressions are located and decompress the nerve effectively then that patient has a great chance to to find permanent relief from their symptoms um let me just scroll through and see if there's any questions that that people are wanting to know about that we haven't already talked about um there's a question here about reynolds syndrome which is a condition that typically affects the hands and has to do with the nerves the the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves that innervate the blood vessels in the hand um that's a little bit different than what i'm talking about with peripheral neuropathy the traditional one traditional approach for people with rene reno's is to try and go in and strip the nerve layer away from the arteries to try and prevent these dramatic changes in color and pain and and temperature sensation that happens in patients with renal syndrome but it's um it's typically like true ray nodes is not is not the same kind of a issue that i'm talking about peripheral neuropathy now patients may be diagnosed inappropriately as having ray nodes when they really just have more run-of-the-mill nerve compressions involving multiple nerves that again like i said any nerve that's compressed can cause can have produce a sympathetic motor response where you can have changes in color due to changes in diameter of veins and arteries you know changes in skin quality and all these other things so raynaud's is a little bit different but there are certainly a subgroup of patients that have probably been diagnosed inappropriately as having rynodes and who really have nerve compressions that can be that are amenable to surgery um some of these comments are just patients who've had nerve decompression surgery doing great just want to say hi so hello to everyone there's a patient here who says um let's see my doctor tells us i believe my peripheral neuropathy was caused by fluoroquinolone toxicity i was given three to four doses of levoquin and prednisone for upper respiratory infections each year for decades i developed peripheral neuropathy which was confirmed by emg nerve conduction study which was a totally pointless exercise essentially because you know anybody who develops these symptoms has peripheral neuropathy until proven otherwise and then constant muscle tendon and ligament pain my doctor would not acknowledge it instead blaming diabetes which i didn't have until after i took the fluoroquinolone and also ignored my tendon and ligament pain for years my inability to walk led to falls i fell down a flight of stairs and five weeks later my left foot dropped or developed a left foot drop the emd nerve conduction study confirmed severe peroneal nerve damage that sometimes in terms of what emg nerve conduction studies in the lower extremities sometimes pick up they can sometimes pick up a common peroneal nerve compression and sometimes pick up a tarsal tunnel syndrome but they will always re miss all the rest of the the nerve compressions um so so then the question is will decompression surgery help and can foot drop be reversed after 15 months is swelling of the foot normal um if left down even for minutes i have swelling and 24 7 pain constantly i live on ice so this is a good question because it brings up a number of subjects to discuss first of all when in somebody who develops significant motor weakness because of a nerve compression there is sort of a time clock that starts ticking ideally you want to get to that before 12 months and certainly before 18 months if it's longer than 18 months then there's very little chance that you're going to have meaning meaningful return of the motor function and the reason for that is not because not necessarily because of the damage that's been done to the nerve but the damage that happens in the muscle itself nerves a good way to think about this is um if you think about an electrical outlet in the wall and uh an extension cord the extension cord is like your nerve and the wall with the outlet is like your muscle so the nerves um synapse to the muscle with a little there's a little receptor on the muscle and at the end of the nerve when a signal comes down it releases some chemicals into that which bind with that receptor on the muscle and cause the muscle to contract what happens if even if you're laying in bed there's there's a continual sort of basal tone of electricity that's being put into the muscles to keep those receptors healthy if you have a situation where the where the nerve signal is cut off completely then if enough time passes what will happen is the electrical outlet will sort of atrophy and fade away so then you're left with a situation where you have the electrical extension cord in your hand but nowhere to plug it in and that's a permanent change to the muscle which can't be reversed now if you're a lot of people use the term foot drop but foot drop is on a scale so it's not like normal and then complete foot drop there's all kinds of shades in between so but very often if somebody has enough weakness they'll be they'll tell them well you have a foot drop which is you know so a partial foot drop versus a complete foot drop is is a an important distinction if you've had a complete foot drop for 15 months where you can't pull that foot up at all or even pull the toes up or wiggle them or anything you might be able to flex them down or push your foot down because those are different nerves but if you can't put the pull the foot up or extend the toes then um the chances of you doing well from in terms of regaining that function from the nerve decompression surgery are certainly decreased significantly it doesn't mean that you couldn't still try the surgery but you know your chances in the setting of a complete foot drop would be low in terms of having a good motor return of function if on the other hand you have some degree of weakness so you have a partial foot drop and it's been 15 months and maybe it's weak enough that it it is affecting your walking um you know in those patients it's worth it to get an mri of the lower leg which can give you some sense of the the amount of damage has been done to the muscle and if the damage doesn't look too severe and they show appropriate findings on physical examination then it's absolutely right thing to do to decompress that nerve and you can expect that there will be at least some improvement in in their motor function and maybe complete return to normal motor function in this particular patient not only do they have the weakness but they also have a lot of pain and so in this patient if they show signs of nerve compression even if you don't have any realistic hope of restoring motor function you should still do the surgery because you still have a great chance to relieve them of their pain which is between a lack of motor function and the horrible pain 100 percent of the time people will choose to get rid of the pain if they can only get rid of one if you have if you don't have pain and even if you have a complete foot drop there are braces and there are other things that can be done that can you know help with that so that it's not as debilitating but if you have the horrible pain there's really nothing that's effective for that other than decompressing the nerve and fixing that um there's a question here about that says what if you had an aroma surgery so that's a little a little bit off topic um from peripheral you know surgery for or nerve decompression surgery for patients who have peripheral neuropathy essentially a neuroma is a different uh situation um and we may cover that more in depth at another time but a neuroma usually forms where the nerve has actually been cut in in half or been crushed very severely and then what you end up having is this ball of scar tissue with live nerve ends that are sort of stuck and trapped in the in the scar tissue ball at any time if that ends up being in a place where it can be stimulated in some manner whether you know direct pressure or being stretched as the body moves and whatnot then that can just be a constant trigger for pain a pain signal to the brain um i'm gonna go out on a limb here and guess the actual comment is what if you had neuroma surgery since we're talking about lower extremities my guess is that this person is is asking about whether what if they've had quote unquote morton's neuroma surgery um morton's neuroma is not really a true neuroma it got that name because on imaging or even visually looking at the nerve it appears to have an aroma meaning there's a sort of a swelling and a fusiform swelling of the nerve looks like there's a you know sort of a blowing up a balloon a little bit a long ones long party beans you blow it up and you get that bulge in the middle first off that's kind of what that looks like it'll it'll show up on an mri and so people um have have incorrectly describe that as an aroma now it could be an aroma if but that but in most people it's not you'd have to have some kind of history of where the person um maybe they kicked something with a barefoot or or jumped off something in bare feet and landed directly on a pointy rock something that could really actually mechanically damage the nerve in most patients what a morton aroma truly is is simply a nerve compression or a mechanical nerve compression unfortunately traditionally the treatment because everybody sort of has viewed this as an aroma and the correct treatment for neuroma is to excise the neuroma because this condition has been incorrectly viewed as a neuroma the traditional treatment has been to go in and cut that structure out with the hopes that the patient's bet gets better the problem with doing this is that you're leaving the proximal end of the nerve or the nerve the end of the nerve is still attached up to the spinal cord and therefore still has electricity in it going back to our our electrical wires analogy for nerves anytime you cut a nerve one end is attached to the spinal cord and one is attached to whatever the nerve went to the end that's attached to the spinal cord still has the electricity in it and so can still generate pain sensations and so the way that a lot of podiatrists and and orthopedic foot and ankle surgeons will do the surgeries they go in and they just find the nerve and they cut it and sort of let it retract up out of sight and just hope everything will be you know kosher in patients that had this surgery very often they'll go on to develop a painful neuroma and then they have actually a much worse problem it's a problem that can be fixed there's an effective surgical procedure for that but it does require a much more involved procedure where the incision and the approach has to be through the arch of the foot away from the weight-bearing surfaces then you have to figure out which nerves go to the place where the nerve was cut and then you can disconnect those nerves much further upstream in the arch where it's away from weight-bearing surfaces and there's some techniques you can do to handle that nerve and and that usually provides a very good solution for that kind of a problem when you just cut the nerve between the toes and sort of let it retract upstream a little bit it ends up scarring down right in the area of the ball of the foot where you bear a lot of your weight and so these patients will end up developing a situation where it becomes almost impossible to bear any weight on the ball of the foot because the severe pain that happens when they do see there's any other questions here when one patient asks are you still working yes i have not uh stopped at all during this covet scare um my office just for those of you don't know is is not one of these places where i have 30 people waiting in the um waiting room is usually one person in the waiting room at a time so the risk and social distancing is very easy to maintain there's a question here what does the surgery involve so that's a good question actually again going back to the the idea that you need to do this comprehensive peripheral nerve exam what that does is it gives you a master blueprint of where all the problems may lay just because you find evidence of a nerve compression on a physical exam doesn't necessarily mean that the patient needs that nerve decompressed and that may seem a little weird but what you do is you you do a very comprehensive peripheral nerve exam and you document all the nerves that show signs of compression and then what you do is you match that up with the description the patient gives you where their actual pain is um and and then you target and and design a surgery and design whatever combination of nerve decompressions are required to target the specific area of pain the patient is talking about now very often in patients with severe peripheral neuropathy um you know you're talking about multiple nerves at multiple locations and both the top and the bottom of the foot are involved and et cetera et cetera but so let's say let's say you have significant symptoms in the bottom of the foot and you show signs of compression of the tibial nerve both up in the calf area and down by the inside of the ankle those are two locations where the nerve can become compressed if it's going to become compressed so you know you see this patient you examine them they show good evidence of the nerve being pinched at both locations in order to get a good result in terms of relieving symptoms in the bottom of the foot it's necessary to to decompress both locations and that can be done at the same time during one surgery so it's two different incisions during the same general anaesthetic the same surgical procedure but you're operating as a surgeon on two different spots on the lower leg and essentially what you're doing you know you could get really technical but essentially for understanding purposes what you're doing is remember you have a nerve that's being that's experiencing the pressure from surrounding tissue so the surgery essentially involves going in getting down to that level of the nerve and then um usually by cutting or sometimes removing a piece of tissue or a band of tissue what you're doing is you're you're opening up the space around that nerve so the nerve is no longer under mechanical compression the concept is exactly the same as carpal tunnel syndrome surgery so carpal tunnel release that basic principle where you're going in you're opening up the carpal canal and relieving the pressure on the median nerve at the wrist level and proximal palm that that concept translates very well to any other nerve compression site in the body you know the the specific steps that the operation involves can vary a lot from one location to another and one nerve to another but essentially bottom line is what you're doing surgically is you're opening up the space around the nerve so the nerve is no longer experiencing external pressure and that's why the symptoms go away because once you stop pressing the nerve typically the symptoms go away um the patient here who asked the question if surgery is scheduled can a second consult be scheduled the day before surgery um as many of you know the majority of my practice are patients who come see me from other states or other countries and so you know we've developed different ways to um accommodate patients and we're very willing to work with patients so you know if somebody has seen me again usually that first evaluation i do a very comprehensive examination and sort of have that that master plan mapped out in terms of where all the the land mines are buried so to speak so if they do if they have a first surgery and they do well but they live in you know i'm here in las vegas nevada if they live in florida and they want to come back for a second surgery very often um as long as nothing has changed in terms of their clinical symptoms you know that can be scheduled without the need for another comprehensive exam um if if i do have any questions about their symptoms or changes i may have them come back before the day of surgery just to make sure that things are fine sometimes what happens is a patient will come and see me who has both upper and lower extremity complaints i take about an hour to do either an upper or a lower comprehensive peripheral nerve evaluation and so um you know the first time they come and see me i i you know there's a lot of stuff that goes into the work up before somebody even comes to las vegas and we do that to try and avoid situations where people go to the time and expense of coming here and then don't have a problem i can help them with and luckily just the nature of these kinds of problems i can usually know that they have something i can help them with before they're having being able or having to have the patient actually physically in front of me and examining them and so most of that is done before the patient gets here and then you know if they if they were coming in their lower extremity neuropathy pain for example was their number one problem but they also had upper extremity issues or maybe another issue that wasn't even related to peripheral neuropathy um but was a nerve issue you know they i would see him the first time and then operate on the next day and then they're coming back for a second surgery because they did well i could certainly see them and do a comprehensive upper extremity peripheral nerve evaluation and the next day do another lower extremity surgery for their lower extreme neuropathy or something like that so um no matter what the problem is we can usually accommodate patients and we're very sensitive to you know time and expense involved in travel and stuff and and try and be as efficient with that as possible however we always ask patients to you know get plane tickets that are refundable just in case something happens and also to be aware of the fact that at the end of the day i have to be the one making a decision whether something's right or wrong to do and so um you know that can impact that that type of a scenario as well um there's a question here during surgery if the problem ends up actually not being neuropathy or tarsal tunnel can you see this during surgery and if so what do you do just stop the surgery so again this essentially is is not something that ever happens the reason being is the diagnosis is not made or confirmed intraoperatively the diagnosis is made clinically by virtue of the history and the physical exam findings and the only way you can confirm that doing surgery was the right thing to do was does the patient tell you that their symptoms have resolved that's the confirmation that the diagnosis was ultimately correct now sometimes when you go in there you can get a sense that the nerve is really tight in that already sort of tight space but that does not translate 100 to a good outcome from the patient and vice versa sometimes it you can't really appreciate that there's severe compression of the nerve and that also doesn't correlate very well with clinically how the patient does there's certain physical exam findings that are much more sensitive and specific for identifying the presence of a nerve compression so for example tarsal tunnel syndrome is compression of the posterior tibial nerve on the inside of the ankle just behind and underneath the ankle bone on the inside of the ankle in somebody with tarsal tunnel syndrome so one of the most important findings is number one are they very tender when you push over that nerve in a normal person it's really not tender to palpate that nerve the second thing you look for is do they have a tinnel sign and this is where you percuss on the nerve you tap on the nerve usually with just another finger or you could use one of those reflex hammers but i just prefer to do it with my finger you you percuss or tap over that nerve firmly and do they demonstrate a tinel sign and what that is is when you tap at the inside ankle level do they get a some kind of sensation usually it's a in most patients it's like a tingling sensation of one varying degree of strength or another that will radiate downstream meaning it'll go into the bottom of the foot and out into the toes occasionally it goes upstream so it'll go up the leg into the calf muscle or in severe cases it might go all the way up into the butt off but if you have those two findings your tender on palpation plus a tinel sign that's a very good um i mean that basically confirms those are the classic signs of nerve compression and it's also a very good prognostic indicator meaning that you're likely to do very well with surgery so you don't ever get in there and sort of look at it and go gee this nerve doesn't look that compressed or the tissue around this nerve doesn't look that tight and they sort of forget the um you know abort the operation sort of halfway done and and and come out and close the skin number one if you do that you and the patient didn't really have a nerve compression let's say for some reason they're falling in that 20 they're going to follow that 20 failure rate and just not have a good um outcome by going in there and causing the trauma to the tissue and sort of partially decompressing the nerve what happens postoperatively you're going to get a lot of swelling there's inflammation there's scarring and almost certainly in a patient that may not have had clinically significant nerve compression they're going to develop a bad nerve compression at that point during that healing process and so that's the type of person who might be much worse off than before surgery and this is where you get into the issue of of why for example if you look in the medical literature and just look at you know success rates for tarsal quote-unquote tarsal tunnel surgery they're very poor maybe most series are somewhere 25 to 50 success rate which is horrible you really shouldn't be doing surgery if your success rate is that bad and the reason is because traditional tarsal tunnel release procedures being done by podiatrists or orthopedic foot and ankle surgeons or regular orthopedic surgeons or what have you they don't understand the anatomy well enough to perform a complete decompression of the nerve and so you partially decompress the nerve and then and then leave it to undergo all the swelling and inflammation and scarring that just happens as a normal course of of any certain around any surgical incision you're almost guaranteed to be worse off because you will develop a worse compression than whatever degree of your original compression was um so again just to summarize the decision to do surgery is is a clinical one and once you make that decision and you're in the operating room you're going to finish the the procedure completely and then in the healing phase the patient will confirm whether or not the diagnosis was correct by virtue of them resolving or not resolving their symptoms there's a question here about uh alcohol-induced peripheral neuropathy that again that's another risk factor um you know if if a patient has a significant alcohol history um it's it's likely that that is the cause of neuropathy but it's not guaranteed it could be some other cause because again not everybody who ex drinks excessively develops peripheral neuropathy so really it doesn't matter what if you don't know the source of uropathy or if you've been told that the source of your neuropathy is diabetes or alcohol consumption or what have you it's still worth it if you're you know if your symptoms are significant to consider having a peripheral nerve evaluation and seeing if you're a candidate for surgery um there's a question or there's a comment here about being low on vitamins and again that's something that should be checked into especially in early stages of anyone with peripheral neuropathy because that that is something that can be very easily fixed usually though patients who are vitamin deficient as the source of their peripheral neuropathy do not have just neuropathy in their feet they usually get in their hands and feet and it's sort of a it's usually not that painful and more of a tingly pins and needles you know that type of sensation hands and feet and once the vitamin deficiency is corrected then that goes away [Music] um so there's a question here what kind of doctor does a nerve compression test um so it depends on sort of what you're what you're getting at traditionally when somebody has peripheral neuropathy they're sent to a neurologist who again knows very little about peripheral nerve anatomy um they do their emg nerve conduction study test which is sort of a redundant test because you could make that diagnosis 99 of time without the test emg nerve conduction studies do have an appropriate use but that usually is more for helping to rule out the source of a problem that's coming from the spine or especially in situations where nerves have been damaged or cut and you're trying to make decisions about whether or not you should go in and try and reconstruct the nerve early or whether the nerve looks like it's intact and just needs time to recover those kind of things for in terms of making decisions about treatments and especially surgical treatment for patients with peripheral neuropathy and emg nerve conduction study is pointless so if you're talking about what kind of doctor do you need to see to determine whether or not you're a candidate for nerve decompression surgery in the setting of peripheral neuropathy you really need to see somebody like myself who has had this training and does this kind of surgery and unfortunately there's very few of us in the world so you know depending on where you are there may be somebody who uh can do that for you or you may need to come to las vegas it just depends but even if somebody you know i have a colleague back east in baltimore and there's one in the mid there's a couple in the midwest so um you know it doesn't matter to me if you go to somebody else i'm still happy to take a look at your your sort of pre-visit paperwork and give you some advice on what's going on and whether or not it's a peripheral nerve problem or maybe you need to see a spine surgeon or whatever but really if you want to if you really want to get answers and especially if you want to get a solution to any kind of peripheral neuro neuro or nerve problem whether it's peripheral neuropathy or pain from other types of nerve problems you need to see a chronic pain-focused peripheral nerve surgeon you cannot you cannot see a reconstructive peripheral nerve surgeon which is what the vast majority if you go on on websites of the mayo clinic or wherever any big teaching hospital or even any big private hospital that sort of says yeah we have a peripheral nerve expert what the what that means is there are reconstructive peripheral nerve experts so if you cut a nerve in half they're very skilled at putting that nerve back together and doing other things you know maybe tendon transfers or whatever and it's it's really geared towards preserving and restoring function when you're talking about somebody who has chronic pain problems or has had an injury and has a very complex peripheral nerve problem these types of reconstructive peripheral neurosurgeons really have very little idea what to do so that's not to say that i'm better than them it's just a totally different field and a different area of expertise i don't really do reconstructive peripheral nerve surgery i don't do it in i mean i can in certain situations where the patient may not have an option to go to uh somebody does a lot more of it but otherwise i refer all those kind of patients to people that do it a lot and are much more skilled at it than i am um my area of expertise is identifying the source of severe chronic pain and fixing it so if if if that's the problem you have you need to come and see me or someone like me [Music] so patient says i have crps number two or crps type 2 due to vascular necrosis in talus and tarsal tunnel reconstruction so type 2 if if you remember for those of you who saw the little discussion about chronic regional or complex regional pain syndrome is the type where theoretically a nerve injury has been identified and in reality most crps is type 2 it's just that people that don't that end up diagnosing these problems typically don't know anything about peripheral nerves so it's usually in terms of identifying the actual nerve problem it's usually a mystery so those people get dumped into the type one category which is why type 1 is 90 type 2 is about 10 but especially in somebody who's already you know in the type 2 category so it's it's that obvious that they have a peripheral nerve problem that almost certainly can be helped with surgery or fixed um the patient here that's that made the statement um so this pa this is the patient that has the foot drop and they they made the comment the afo brace causes more pain an afo brace is just a type of plastic brace that that supports the ankle and very often it comes up quite high on the lower leg and well and ironically you know they have these straps or bands that you tighten up and ironically where that upper strap is located is actually putting pressure right around the area where the nerve is already compressed so um yeah they can cause pain because they're exacerbating a nerve compression that's already existing [Music] so you know ironically it's it's helping to stabilize the ankle but can be exacerbating the nerve compression problem there's a question here says if if the diet if you get diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy and tarsal tunnel are they both done at the same time so again the way to think about this is peripheral neuropathy just refers to the clinical symptoms so you might have peripheral neuropathy that is amenable to nerve decompression surgery and you might have a type of peripheral neuropathy that is not appropriate to do surgery for and that's you know that that's figured out with the physical examination peripheral neuropathy basically just is a generic term for anybody who's suffering from numbness tingling burning pins and needles weakness affecting the hands or feet essentially the superimposed nerve compression component that's that's what tarsal tunnel means somebody could have tarsal tunnel syndrome without peripheral neuropathy where they just have an isolated compression of the posterior tibial nerve in the area of the inside of the ankle and that can cause a lot of the same symptoms of peripheral neuropathy because again remember that the clinical symptoms of peripheral neuropathy are most of the time at least eight percent of the time due to the nerve being pinched not due to some other problem so whether you have peripheral neuropathy where the nerves globally have swollen and become larger so that you're developing multiple points of nerve compression and therefore you're developing developing symptoms like as if you had a sock on versus somebody who just has an isolated or single point of nerve compression i.e tarsal tunnel syndrome or nerve compression on the inside of the ankle the clinical symptoms are going to be the same essentially i mean or could be the same and so you know if if you have if you've been diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy and then you had an emg nerve conduction study which also identified tarsal tunnel syndrome essentially what the surgery does is you're addressing the nerve compressions and almost certainly there's also a proximal tibial nerve compression which is the same nerve as involved in tarsal tunnel but just at a higher level in the leg that the emg nerve conduction study has missed but that all gets picked up on physical examination and so again when you do a surgery designed to alleviate symptoms in in some part of the body ie the bottom of the foot if the patient shows signs of nerve compression both up in the calf right or the proximal tibial nerve as well as down in the ankle or the tarsal tunnel you want to decompress both locations so they have a good outcome from the surgery in other situations they might only need the proximal tibial nerve decompress or may only need the tarsal tunnel decompressed and and that's where physical exam is very good at differentiating where these problems lie and what you need to actually do um so there's a patient here that i've already operated on and um so in patients that have complex problems sometimes one surgery does not relieve all of the problem and again this is where it's important to be evaluated by somebody who can look at the whole picture otherwise it gets very you know if you go to a podiatrist or an orthopedic foot and ankle surgeon or somebody who sort of has tunnel vision when it comes to nerve decompression surgery they sort of they learned how to do you know a tarsal tunnel release but they don't even understand there can be other points of nerve compression or other nerves that can cause problems if you don't have a good result or maybe you have a partial result so something's better but you still have pain they don't really know what to do so in patients who who've had some kind of nerve procedure and they still have pain very often most of the time what that means is there's some other area that needs to be identified and addressed and the gamut of peripheral nerve problems can be something from very simple where it's just one tiny nerve that's been injured or one nerve at one location that's been that is compressed all the way up to multiple nerves at multiple levels from the waist all the way down to the toes that need to be addressed to really give the patient good relief and so um it's actually very important for patients who have complex problems to really be able to hang in there through the process because if they give up on it after one surgery you know they're not going to have great great relief from the overall pain burden the sad thing about peripheral nerves is if you have 10 peripheral nerves that are damaged in some way or 10 different peripheral nerve injuries and you address nine of them perfectly and one of them still remains the patient's quality of life can still be horrible because all it takes is one peripheral nerve problem to produce enough pain to where the patient wants to you know put a gun in their mouth so you really to get great results especially in complex patients you really have to be able to evaluate the entire system and then it's almost like you have to hit a home run or close to it every time in order to give them either complete relief or meaningful reduction in their pain to the point where whatever's left over can be managed and lived with in a in a reasonable fashion um let's see so here's a quote here's a patient who made this statement we have seen neurologists and podiatrists neurologists said nothing can be done so that's i mean 100 out of 100 neurologists are going to tell you there's nothing you can do for your peripheral neuropathy except take gabapentin or up your dose of narcotics and the podiatrist gave a 40 supplement the supplements almost never work again like all this stuff there's this huge pool of snake oil salesmen out there who are continually conning patients with peripheral neuropathy saying you know it's it's a very seductive siren song that they that they uh you know do because you know surgery is is a bigger deal certainly there's there's risks of surgery and just the idea of surgery is very um you know disconcerting for a lot of patients and so you know somebody tells you i can fix your peripheral nerve if you just you know um drink this green stuff and put your foot in water and i'll run this electrical current through and i'll take care of it yeah it'll cost you 200 bucks a week and we need to do it for five months or whatever but you'll get better i mean it's very easy to do that versus you know wow you know go to go surgery have my body cut open i have to have general anaesthesia it seems much more intimidating so it's it's a very uh common thing that patients would opt for like sort of the less invasive thing and i totally understand it but um essentially most of like 99 of those patients are not gonna have good relief with supplements and other than this the few people that have a true vitamin deficiency which again is we're rare in the west because we just have diets that cover most of that stuff you know there's certain patients that will have these problems maybe they've had a bunch of their small bowel removed or they have other medical conditions it allows them not to absorb these nutrients appropriately but for most people you know all these places that advertise you know fixing your peripheral neuropathy pain through physical therapy or electricity or shining lights on your feet or some kind of supplement that you ingest it's it's a waste of your money i'm not saying don't try it if that's what you want to do but just in my experience talking to thousands of patients who've gone that route uh you know most of them do not get any sustained kind of benefit there's a patient who says i'm having saphenous nerve injections every other tuesday after having crps type two for six years i've had three reconstruction tarsal tunnel surgery due to vascular necrosis in the talus i had severe pain 24 7 and pain insomnia i've never heard of that term actually but i understand it it's you know pain that doesn't allow you to sleep obviously and that is a very common thing that people in with peripheral nerve pain experience i've had three trial spinal cord stimulators or maybe okay three trial nerve stimulators one in the spinal cord and two down in the calf could your procedure be of any help um almost certainly the see the problem with a patient like this is they've been everything that's been done has been done by somebody who's not an expert in the peripheral nervous system particularly when it comes to dealing with chronic pain you know if if for example this saphenous nerve injection if that relieves some component of your pain very effectively but you only get relief for four or five days and the pain comes back and then two weeks you're back there for another injection there's an excellent way to relieve that pain and that's actually going in and finding that nerve and disconnecting it the saphenous nerve is a nerve that only has sensory function so you do trade off some numbness to certain areas of skin in the lower leg but it relieves the pain and most people are dealing with this kind of pain will take that trade off in a heartbeat 100 of the time um you know she said i've had three reconstructions so three types of ankle surgery i don't know if it's all tarsal tunnel surgery but you know with vascular cross and the taste i assume that some of it was orthopedic surgery to address the the skeletal issues what happens very often in these types of situations especially if an orthopedic surgeon or podiatrist has done the tarsal tunnel release is they don't do an adequate operation and like i mentioned a few minutes ago if you operate on a nerve and don't do the right operation especially in terms of a full and complete decompression nerve what you end up with is a situation where the nerve is more compressed than it was before and so the patient every operation will typically be as worse or likely more being more pain than they were to begin with and that's the danger of letting people who don't really understand these problems operate on you there's a question here about can you discuss neuropathy in the buttock area so when you're talking about symptoms up in the buttock area now you're now you're expanding it out to sort of a more general definition of peripheral neuropathy as you know any any area that you might feel numbness or tingling or whatever technically falls under the umbrella of peripheral neuropathy but it is a little bit different than the discussion we've been having about you know diabetic peripheral neuropathy or idiopathic peripheral neuropathy where the symptoms are primarily confined to the lower legs feet and hands forearm areas so if you have numbness in the buttock area anytime somebody's experiencing numbness one important thing to talk about is is is it actually numbness that involves skin or more of an internal sensation of numbness because that gives me a lot of information as as the examiner as to what nerve might be involved if it's numbness to the actual skin then you're thinking about the nerves that go and innervate the skin if it's a deeper inside numbness but the skin itself is not numb then you're thinking automatically about different nerves and that's where you know a combination of all these things and that's why if anybody's ever who has come and seen me and knows that i make them fill out this patient summary it's very important to be as detailed as possible about the actual clinical symptoms that you're experiencing the character the location how where pain starts where it radiates to because that and that's why i can usually figure out if it's a problem i can help with even you know over the phone or just by reading because it's so because these problems are so anatomy based in terms of the peripheral nerve anatomy just describing accurately where your symptoms are and what part of the body is affected will very often identify the nerve that's affected you know somebody develops a foot drop or one of these types of problems very often what happens is there's compensation made where the patient starts to bear weight predominantly on the opposite limb and this can lead to all kinds of musculoskeletal problems layered on top of the peripheral nerve problem and can lead to additional peripheral nerve problems so again for you know that's a patient who obviously has a more complex problem and really what cuts through the fog of this chronic pain is seeing somebody who understands peripheral nerves and knows how to examine them you an emg nerve conduction study doesn't do it and imaging studies don't really do it they can supplement in certain situations but it's no substitute for actually understanding the nerve anatomy and being able to do a detailed peripheral nerve examination [Music] this is patient this patient with foot drive has a lot of questions but she talks she's asking here if you know if you decompress the compreneal nerve maybe it gets rid of the pain but your function doesn't come back what are the other options so in that situation a tendon transfer to stabilize the ankle could be an option um again that's a little bit out of my wheelhouse so but that's something you could discuss with an orthopedic surgeon or they're making better and better braces now that are not as intrusive and that actually there's some spring assisted ones that can help with sort of pulling your foot up instead of just keeping it at a rigid 90 degrees so you know she says my doctor just brushed that idea off i'm not sure i mean um you know sometimes doctors are more hesitant to consider these things in the face of a situation where the patient has a lot of pain they don't really want to operate because they're worried about making the pain worse but if you get rid of the pain you still have a foot drop then they're much more you know an orthopedic foot and ankle guy for example is much often much more amenable to considerating considering a pure orthopedic procedure to address a problem that they understand better um uh this uh so there's a patient here says i've been dealing with numbness in my calves and feeding is migrated into the buttocks area and it is internal not just surface so the question is is it internal and surface it's my guess is it's surface lower down like below the knee level and above the knee level it's probably more internal although it could involve some areas of surface skin and again that just needs a very good careful peripheral nerve evaluation and that combined with an mri of the lumbar spine to make sure it's unlikely to be a spine issue will come very close to identifying where the problems are and then sometimes additional things need to be done i.e an mrnaurography the pelvis or specific nerve blocks to rule in or rule out other nerves that may be involved the question here can arthritis cause nerve compression with neuropathy symptoms um i would say typically no other than a specific situation where or where a joint is so arthritic and gets so deformed that it actually um starts producing mechanical compression on a nerve that's running right by the joint in that sort of more or less rare isolated situation it can i will say that a much more common thing that i hear from patients though especially older patients is you know they come in with chronic pain or neuropathy stuff and they've just been told it's just your arthritis you're old and you know arthritis you just gotta learn to live with it so um that's not necessarily that's sort of a cop out a lot of times on uh the part of the doctor but technically speaking arthritis in the joints doesn't usually translate directly to causing peripheral neuropathy [Music] looks like i'm sort of blown through all the questions here and you know it's an hour and 38 minutes i don't want to make these videos too long or they become kind of onerous to to review later for other people and search you and whatnot so i think we'll end it there um you know if you have other questions or you have severe symptoms again you're always welcome to send me an email um request to patients at tallstopmd.com and and i will work with you before you ever come and see me and see if you have a problem that can be helped with surgery and then it's your decision what to do after that but um i sort of do that because it's it's the odds of somebody with a nerve problem of actually finding me are so low unfortunately or even somebody like me just because of how few of us there are um that you know i'm happy to try and help people and and figure these problems out from afar at least in the initial stages so hope everybody enjoyed that uh it's fun to do these and hopefully you'll find it informative and we'll see you next time bye"
