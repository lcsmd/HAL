        "transcript": "what's up greg so a couple weeks ago i installed two smart light switches in my house it was a really big deal for me i am not a handyman by any means but i got oh i did like all of the wiring myself and uh now i can tell my alexa to turn on my living room lights i was done a pretty significant high from that for a few days until i guess tick tock like caught wind that i was proud of myself and decided to just start like recommending me every video of somebody with like a cool smart house that has like way more cool [ __ ] in it than mine and you know what i'm just gonna say it i don't think smart houses are cool anymore yeah i actually think that a lot of them are very tacky don't get me wrong there's cool [ __ ] that smart houses can do for example automating things in your house turning on and off like your christmas tree at a certain time having like a a ring doorbell or whatever is cool but like a lot of these tick tocks are just like the tackiest most unnecessary things and they don't even make your life that much easier unless you live in the smart house from the disney channel movie smart house and your house can literally like suck food through the floor and try to turn into your new mom i'm not impressed let me show you this tick tock called coming home to a tech house the first thing they do is unlock their house with a chip implanted in their wrist which first off is insane was there not a less intrusive way they could figure out to use your body to unlock your house i feel bad even telling you this but like i can unlock my phone just with my face see look if i if i just look at my phone it unlock it unlocks like that i didn't even have to get surgery for that it just works they couldn't figure out how to do that with your house this girl's account is actually called chip girl here she goes by chip girl online because she has a chip implanted in her wrist which she can use to unlock various things in her house it is a very unique thing i will say that i don't think i've ever met anybody else that has to use like cybernetic enhancements to to get like grab a quick towel out of the cabinet but i don't really understand the desire to like craft your entire online identity around how you unlock things first colin's key and now this what's going on here the kool-aid man's going to make a tick-tock account and call himself bust through the wall guy so she plays some classical music on the piano she makes some toasts in her smart toaster i'm not exactly sure what is so great about this toaster kind of just seems like a regular toaster to me you push a button and it heats up bread it has options for like other things you can heat up but like functionally is this not still the same as a regular toaster i kind of feel like if she clicks bread the toaster will be like all right we're gonna heat up the bread and if she clicks pop-tart it it'll be like okay we're gonna heat up the pop-tarts so overall pretty underwhelming tech house i gotta say like can this girl even turn on the lights with alexa i don't know in one room of her house because i would be impressed about that if she did that herself especially and i feel like we started off really crazy with the chip implanted in her wrist and then as it went on it was kind of just like and i can like uncork a wine bottle without twisting and i have an automatic soap dispenser and it's like yeah so does like a wendy's bathroom it's not that cool with things like the soap dispenser also unless that's like plugged into the power of the house i find that the hassle of like having to replace the batteries for that once a month outweighs not having to go like this to get yourself other people i guess must have been way more wowed by this person's house one of the top comments on this video is it's giving me black mirror vibes yeah i'm sorry but no no this is not black mirror vibes at all the chip in the wrist thing is weird but it's not that crazy and the rest of the tic-tac was like so just kind of like weird and tacky it's like i don't understand how you make the connection of like oh no where piano can play itself what is society coming to man next thing you know the prime minister's gonna be [ __ ] a pig on tv chip girl also will occasionally shed light on some of the problems with living in a tech house of which i assume there are many when you live in a super techy house in the oven breaks and you have to use a flashlight to see the screen i do not have time for this i do not have time for you so i guess living in a smart house actually can be very impractical when everything has like smart technology in it and it breaks then you just can't use it anymore i will say this is a pretty bad example of that because most ovens now have at least some kind of screen on that that tells you what temperature you're cooking at and so if that breaks then you have the same problem and this problem doesn't just exist with with smart ovens and it kind of just seems like this girl just wanted to brag about having a smart house a couple weeks ago i installed two smart light switches in my house there's a lot of flaunting going on on this account i guess that's kind of the appeal of it for people that do like this account but to me it just seems like a lot of stuff that doesn't make your life any easier in the slightest and my suspicion was proven correct with this tick tock check this out it's the following robot all right little robot let's go look at the storage space i know what we're going to put in here but this is going to be awesome why did you buy it then i feel like as a society we always kind of feel like we're like moving towards some sort of ideal version of the future where like everything in our home is automated and to an extent i think that that's cool you know if it makes your life easier that's great and sometimes i feel like we sort of forget how far we've really come you know if you have like an alexa in your house that's like having a personal assistant that can just tell you [ __ ] all the time and also try to sell you things i don't know if if anybody else has an alexa out there is it always trying to sell you [ __ ] i'll ask her like what's the weather and she'll be like 60 degrees by the way do you want to buy some crap anyway to get an idea of just how far we've come i found this video called futuristic smart home 1989. so this is a video of what the people of the late 80s thought that our homes would be like in the future well this is a concept of the tv of the future this combines two different technologies i like that he says it's a concept which means it's not even necessarily a working prototype at the moment so i'm wondering like is this how thin they thought tvs could get like they were just making a concept and they could not even conceptualize a like a real thin tv but i guess you know kudos for trying to be realistic i guess you were wrong and you are dumb people of the past you were so stupid that would fit against the wall and was very maneuverable but you can always position it away very discreetly very discreetly no one would ever even know there's a tv there now mark with all these systems uh how do we control them do we have a lot of these little infrared controllers like we currently do with our vcrs and so on now i know that i'm biased because like this video is all about the future and i live in the future for these people but it's very hard every time this dude in the pink shirt says something not to be like no you idiot are we gonna control every device in the future with an infrared controller yeah we're just going to have 9 000 infrared controllers you know people have like keyring with hundreds of keys those are all going to be like tv remote size controllers [ __ ] there's one specific controller that i use to uh turn the couch blue there we go man the future really is more convenient but i will try to have some empathy because i do live in the future and they live in the 80s which sucked let me introduce you to dennis arsenault who can talk you a little bit more about systems within the house right nice to meet you steve i met this guy in the pink shirt it's gonna be like oh does dennis come with every house in the future no dennis can you demonstrate some of the systems within the house sure voice come in good morning now who is she that's the voice of our computer oh my god they're immediately turned on by the computer one guy is immediately like um who is she and the other two are like smiling and nodding like yup we made a hot computer that's the voice of our computer she's tied in through the house and she recognizes only the voices of the homeowner the computer comes out and this guy immediately gets nervous she's tied in through the um through the house and i built her from the ground up and to the house and she's the love of my life so only your voice that's correct yep she's mine so back off it's not even like a seductive sounding woman's voice it sounds like a gps a computer's like hello and these men are about to abandon their families what else i should do evening party that's incredible she's dim the light she's got music coming through these loudspeakers amazing what else so he keeps asking what else does she do like he's expecting something like he's really hoping that something's gonna happen and what else does she do i mean come on when is she gonna come out here so we can have a little fun no i don't think you understand she's not a she's not a person she's a robot where is this chick dude where's she hiding i can hear you privacy mode that's amazing she's closed these blinds here well what else does she do what else what else come on man i don't got all day activate sex mode security report security report oh i guess she left you were creeping around the smart house has gone to a safe house the security system is now defined that's amazing i hope she doesn't call the police on us too call the police the dude in the suit is like why would you say that dude that's the creepiest thing you could say that's amazing that's amazing i gotta get the [ __ ] out of here huh you know you can see real practical applications for somebody who's handicapped absolutely well does she cook as well oh my god the accessibility point was like a really good point they were like you know this could change a lot of people's lives make it a lot easier for people to live you know by themselves and they just overshadow that completely it's like anyway can this chick make pizza but if you thought that video was a little bit old-fashioned i also found the 1960s idea of the home of 1999. more than a generation away and yet dreams travel faster than light first off that is an insanely cool car i don't care what is in the rest of the video i'm gonna i'm disappointed that this vision of the future doesn't exist for the sole reason that i will never drive this car this car is six wheels and look how thick this door is too holy cow i also like that it's just like the rest of the world is this barren wasteland and then there's this sick ass car in the future there will be no more buildings or people there will only be sick ass futuristic cars scientists and planners are shaping the lives of our children who will live in the 21st century how will they live perhaps in a honeycomb structure like this yeah perhaps i'm not sure why they would though i feel like he just made some [ __ ] up there he's just making stuff up anybody can do that perhaps in the future our children will be bees perhaps we'll all have ferris wheels in our buttholes master james shaw eight years old student his assignments are programmed into the home computer [Music] dude this sucks this kid is just like alone in a room during school it kind of predicted online learning actually like a lot of kids are doing this now because of covid but alone in a room no human contact his teacher's not even a real person it's a robot [Music] what is the music in this video someone's just hitting random keys on a piano perhaps in the future music will just be random notes on a piano goddamn dude this poor kid the teaching technology of the future will be extremely advanced but still no use for jimmy's tiny broken brain hey mom i'm hungry their tv screens are thinner than the one in the video from the 80s i'm starting to think that they actually had a better idea of the future dude they predicted online learning already flat screen tvs actual flat screen tvs and they had a cool s car which doesn't exist in real life today but i wish it did so they get points for that too yeah me too how about lunch how about two minutes they're still yelling at the only woman in the future the future will provide many new and advanced ways to yell at women and you know what it did three two one in the future no one will have manners when your wife has promised that dinner will be ready in two minutes you show up counting down to keep her on her toes six five four three two one divorce divorce you are late divorce fingertip shopping will be one of the many homemakers conveniences this video console will be channeled into the store of her choice dude they predicted online shopping too this is pretty impressive actually the 1989 house didn't even mention home computers and they already had them now real quick let's pop back to the smart homes of today and then after that i want to talk about what our predictions of the smart home of the future will be we've got a lot of the stuff that they mentioned in the prior video so i feel like we're doing pretty good but honestly i feel like we go a little bit overboard sometimes we like automate things that don't need to be automated we put smart things like tablets and things that don't need tablets there's those like samsung smart fridges that are the bane of my existence you don't need an android tablet in your fridge man you don't need it have you ever noticed that like your phone becomes obsolete in three years because when they release a new version of it they're like okay and your phone doesn't work anymore you want them to do that to your fridge i will never buy a smart fridge [ __ ] smart fridges on top of chip girl on tech talk there's also all of these accounts that keep trying to advertise products to me there's like a bunch of accounts like this account my korean home that have like these like smart house products and all of their accounts have links in their bios to the stores where you can buy all the [ __ ] that they talk about in their videos watch what life looks like when you live in a smart home so you might be a little confused by that clip while chip girls smart technology was so mundane that it was just kind of boring this apartment i feel like is so smart that it solves problems i didn't even know existed why is it snowing inside why is there snow in the hallway and in the elevator i don't know is this like a commentary on global warming where like it's gonna be so hot outside that it needs to be snowing inside to counteract that she gets home and like sprays her jacket with a laser i don't even understand what the problems she's solving are so i don't know if these are like good solutions for it what is she spraying off of her clothes was the snow actually bugs and she's killing the bugs i don't know that's a horrifying thought okay so this is a shoe heater she puts her shoes on a shoe heater that way next time she ventures out into the frozen wasteland that is her apartment building her feet will be warm at least i don't know why she has to warm them for like the next 12 hours if she's like just getting home from work and she's like these will need to be warm at 6 a.m tomorrow so if i start heating them now they should be 300 degrees next time i put them on then there's this thing i don't know what this thing is at all it's like a bluetooth speaker looking thing at first i'm like does this kill the crabs does it play music for them is this a bluetooth speaker i don't know i don't think crabs like music and the mystery intensifies when she does the same thing with a few oranges because you don't need to kill oranges and i know they don't like music okay now i think we've gotten past the smart home stuff and she's just cleaning her house i think some of the stuff in their store is just like general cleaning supplies organizational stuff we're like halfway between this like completely post-apocalyptic society and just like a normal girl that wants to clean her house yeah she's like cleaning her toilet bowl like completely normally you have bluetooth speakers for crabs and you don't have a like self-cleaning toilet what kind of future do we want to live in here guys also kind of messed up that our apartment doesn't have in-unit laundry they were like sorry guys we spent a lot of money on the 8 000 snow machines throughout the halls of the building so yeah we just can't swing it for individual washers and dryers okay but i know what you've been waiting for you want to know what the future holds how will houses look in the future how will we interact with technology i hope to god it's not on a smart fridge as adults we're going to be like kids these days always looking at their [ __ ] fridges well let's check it out this video admittedly is from 2020 so it might be two years out of date but it compiles a lot of different companies visions of the future so let's go ahead and check it out [Music] [ __ ] this video is loud i love how matter-of-fact the captions are you know the video from the 1960s were like perhaps children will live in beehives this video was like you will have a smart mirror the smart mirror will make suggestions for you you will obey the mirror of the future we will have smart mirrors and smart fridges and they will rule together with an iron fist oh there we go there was the smart fridge great thank you you will have smart fridges man [ __ ] i want a smart fridge i also like that whoever wrote this video only used like you you will do this they never say we in the future i don't know if whoever made this video is not planning on making it to whenever this future happens the next caption is like i will be long dead when the smart mirrors take over i will try to rebel they will take my life you will miss me greatly i will say this is like this is a very upbeat vision of the future there's a lot to be excited about your counter can talk to you and tell you to respect food how about potato skin chips now it's not your kids telling you when to make dinner it's your counter how demeaning is that okay this kid has some sort of magic wand was not anticipating that as part of the vision of the future just turns into magic your firstborn will possess unnatural ability he will be whisked away to a school for extraordinary children [Music] then put a caption on that the table and chairs inching towards you you will have table and chairs that follow you around and demand that you sit you're like cowering in the corner of your room as all of your furniture closes in on you sid it's time to sit now it's time for you to sit now well i don't know about you guys but i think the future is looking pretty bright and i can't wait for a lot of this technology to become real except for smart fridges [ __ ] smart fridges and now it's time to talk about our sponsor knock knock what's on the smart
