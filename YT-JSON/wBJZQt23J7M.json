    "transcript":  "in this video I\u0027m going to show you 15 insane use cases for the new Claude 3.5 Sonet model that was just released now when this thing came out I was like oh great another claw model this probably isn\u0027t going to be very good but after I tested it I quickly found out that this is much better than GPT 4 or any model that I\u0027ve used in the past and the crazy thing to think about is this is the worst that this model is going to get it only improves from here now we\u0027re going to be doing things in this video like creating web applications interactive dashboards from a PDF I\u0027m going to show you how I created a realtime object detection program all from Claude all of this I did with Claude and I have no coding experience all I am is a YouTuber who has a little bit of experience with website design now we\u0027re going to get into those 15 use cases but first I wanted to show you this because I know if you\u0027re here right now you\u0027re definitely an AI Enthusiast you like staying on top of artificial intelligence so this group is the perfect thing for you I\u0027m going to leave this group in the description or the top pend comment below and what this group is is a community for this channel AI Foundation and we\u0027re in here all day talking about artificial intelligence not only that but we have a classroom filled with multiple different AI educational courses and in the calendar tab you can see all of our live calls that we have coming up you know Carter and I like going live with the group and the live calls have been amazing so far a lot of interaction and a lot of unique Insight found on artificial intelligence so if that\u0027s something that interests you if you love talking about Ai and want to stay in the know and up to-date and learn all the powerful techniques then this is the place to be again it\u0027s in the description below or the top end comment now let\u0027s get into the awesome use cases that collaud 3.5 Sonet has to offer the first use case is to create an interactive dashboard when using a PDF so let\u0027s say I\u0027m reading this white paper on a large language model prompting technique called reflexion now this is kind of a complex topic but it goes into a verbal reinforcement technique in order to help large language models have better responses let\u0027s say I read this and now I want to have a fun way of interacting with that information I can upload that PDF by hitting add content and then I can type in a quick prop I said create an interactive PDF dashboard to help me view test and learn this information in a more visually appealing way then I said make it dark mode of course I\u0027m going to send that off and make sure that you have the artifacts feature enabled because what this is going to do is it\u0027s going to open up a dual screen view where it showing you the code that it\u0027s generating for your PDF dashboard and not only that but after it generates the code we\u0027re going to be able to preview and use this dashboard live and we might get an error sometimes it starts off with an error but it\u0027s very easy to fix you just past the error and CLA and it\u0027ll fix it for you but as you can see nothing went wrong here as we can see we have this amazing dashboard that was just created based on the PDF that I uploaded and that I was just showing you we have different tabs for decision making we have icons in here I mean this is just beautiful reasoning 20% improvement over Baseline it really helps you see this in a more visual way I can go to programming and what I can even do is I can add things to this as we go I said add a tab for graphs showing the examples and also a test test tab where I can test my knowledge with a 10 question quiz I can send it off and it\u0027s going to keep the same structure but just add onto the code that I already have not that I already have but that it already made me as you can see we have two more tabs and the graphs tab isn\u0027t currently displaying a graph so we could just reiterate that but we now have a quiz tab that has 10 questions that we can go through and answer use case number two is to use animations and create animations to visualize anything I got pretty unique with this one I said create a visualization showing me how cells work in a human body body in order to heal a wound from getting injured to the wounds being healed what it created me was this wound healing process image but what I wanted was an animation this was great though I mean for 10 seconds just typing out a quick prompt having this be generated this is very very cool it shows the injury the inflammation of the injury the proliferation and then the remodeling which is very cool you can kind of see how that might go from a cut to inflamed to Healing to remodeling now this was pretty good I liked how it showed the whole process and did it quickly but I wanted it moving so I asked can you make us a visualization with cells actually moving around and this is what it created me next an actual visualization of cells moving around within this little box and it changed each part for me so it went from injury to inflammation and as you can see the cells are moving a little bit faster to proliferation and then finally to the remodeling stage but this still is not what I was after right I wanted a couple more things done so that\u0027s when I just ask all you have to do is ask now eventually I ended up just prompting with Claude and getting this visualization in this anim to look something like this so that it looks like somebody\u0027s actually getting cut right here and so this would be the arm process getting hurt and then we zoom in on that cut I had it do all this just by prompting as I showed you and now I have actually inside the cut the entire process with a progress bar and more of a time-lapse formation which is just amazing it even has some key points down here in terms and then it zooms back out and Loops the animation use case number three is to make visual diagrams and illustrations and based on static images let\u0027s say I\u0027m reading this white paper on large language models and I want to see this in a different visual way what I\u0027m going to do is I\u0027m just going to screenshot this then I\u0027m going to hit add content and then just upload that screenshot of this neural network flow and I\u0027m just going to say stimulate the movement of information through this neural network image using moving elements and react I can send that off and based on the static image it\u0027s going to create code in order to stimulate the movement of information through this static image which is very cool it\u0027s going to create its own little environment it\u0027s going to use all the code show us a preview and it\u0027s going to show us how information is actually moving in the static image so that we can see it in a more visual way as you can see it says unsupported libraries if it ever does that just copy in your error code copy the entire message and paste it in and it will fix it for you as you can see it creates a mock of the image and actually has moving elements for how information is passing through this but as you can see I don\u0027t have any input values in here and nothing\u0027s labeled properly so I\u0027ll say add input values make sure information is moving correctly and make it bigger just simple English right just simple natural language to this large language model as you can see everything\u0027s labeled now and we actually have different lines that it\u0027s moving through as you can see it\u0027s moving through all these hidden layers based on inputs and this is just amazing to watch and it\u0027s cool that it can do all this in a matter of seconds and you could keep on going with this I mean you could go as in-depth as you want you could make it look however you want you could add in multiple different inputs you could really go through this and make it your own use case number four is to create web applications using Claude 3.5 Sonet now this one\u0027s fun I created a whole states of matter diagram showing how the states of matter react when under certain conditions let me show you how I did that as you can see I literally built this thing with a couple of promps and clawed now this is just amazing I\u0027ll show you the promps I used in order to do this but here\u0027s the idea of it I select a particle type let\u0027s say neon and then I add my quantity let\u0027s say I want a 100 of those particles in here I can hit add and it adds it to the simulation box of the neon particles moving around and these things are Dynamic so when I up temperature they start moving faster if I update pressure they go through this pressure line and if there\u0027s too much pressure too many particles and the temperature is too high then it will explode because the pressure is so much that it just blows the lid off of this simulation and then all the atoms go scattered we have a dynamic information panel updating with how many particles are within the simulation this thing just gets pretty wild so if I increase pressure once again and temperature there they all go seems like it be like very hard to code and it would be if you doing it on your own because if I go to the code I mean there are 224 lines of code so yeah that would take a long time and I just did it in a couple minutes just prompting and asking Claud some questions and whenever there\u0027s an application error all I do is upload it and it fixes it right away and I ask basic questions like this when I add particles I don\u0027t see them moving nothing is there I want them moving around and then it does that for me and I just keep on going through perfecting this until I get it exactly how I want it and you end up with a final product like this I mean this is just amazing where you can create these little apps there\u0027s an SEO tool that I\u0027m going to create a little later in this video that I want to show you because that\u0027s an example of how you could use it for business use case number five is to quickly create games whether that be existing games or unique games that you come up with or that you strategize with and create with Claude let me show you some examples of not only how to create a basic game but also examples from how some people on X used it to create more advanced games yes we can do the classic example of create the game Snake using react and make it functional you could even do this with python using vs code I\u0027m going to send this off and it\u0027s creating the snake game in react for us just like this and we\u0027ll be able to play it within Claude which is very interesting so now we have the snake game in react but as you can see our arrows aren\u0027t working so you can just ask Claude and it will edit it for you it just said make it so my arrows move the snake and now as you can see my arrows are actually moving the snake after making that quick adjustment my snake goes through the walls if it hits itself then the game is over now that\u0027s a basic game I\u0027ve seen people even make Tetris with this which is quite amazing but this is one expost that I saw and came across that I was just amazed by created by this user he says I just recreated a basic 3D Doom game using Claude 3.5 Sonet with artifacts and just three prompts this game is procedurally generated Maps sound effects zombies that come after you in a mini map to do something like this took me two days with GPT 4 when it first came out and if you watch this it\u0027s just amazing it even has sound effects as well but he\u0027s doing all of this while in Claude in the preview section he has a map he can stop these things from coming at him by hitting his Mouse button and he did this with three prompts he created a game like this that is just amazing so congratulations to this guy and just to show us what you could do in the video game industry with something like Claude 3.5 Sonet use case number six is to create 8 bit or 16bit styled images so I could say something like create an 8bit style image of Pac-Man when I send that off Claude ended up giving us this fun 8 bit styled Pac-Man with him over here on the right eating these white pellets on the left next I asked it to do a Mario photo on a white background and then it gave me this 8bit styled Mario SVG which is very cool and you can even see the code that it did in order to do this then I thought you know what let\u0027s do a 16bit styled Mario instead which gives him a little bit more detail here you can see the code it gets a little bit more complex to generate this SVG and then I did the 128bit Mario high res resolution Vector SVG and there was a lot more code to this and Mario turned out looking very interesting I\u0027m not sure if this is even Mario at all it kind of scared me but I do like the 16bit and the 8bit styled images a lot so I recommend you give that a shot the next use case for this new claw update is to generate 3D simulations or visualizations now for this one I just want to take you back over to X because I think there\u0027s some users there who have done some amazing things with actually generating 3D objects in a single conversation so let\u0027s go take a look at some of those this gentleman right here ended up making a 3D solar system with physics and collision so if I open this up as you can see he can hit add a random planet and it adds planets certain planets Collide it\u0027s very cool and I love how all of this works Dan here actually created this 3D cube animation with balls bouncing around inside the cube using claude\u0027s new artifact feature he said this took him only 30 minutes to do with all of these functions added but that\u0027s a very cool example of showing how he did that 3D bouncing ball simulation here\u0027s another animation created by Max zyell and it\u0027s another particle Cube animation with a bunch of different factors that they have the ability to edit which is very neat and this is just amazing at what Claud is capable of doing now and here\u0027s another example of somebody creating a 3D gaming CLA I mean this just looks amazing and I guess you could put this in 3D simulations category this created by coffee vectors said it took him 90 minutes it\u0027s crazy how it can incorporate sound effects 3D elements and so much more the next use case in Claude is to actually compare data now with this new artifacts update I found that the data analysis side of Claude is much more powerful here\u0027s an example so if I just upload a data set I\u0027ll just upload my sub based platform data set this is a very very basic Google sheet showing month revenue for that month and social media post for the month and first what I can do is I can just say convert this CSV into Json and then it\u0027s going to give me that Json representation of the data just like this and this is going to allow us to actually create an interactive chart using something from the JavaScript library next one I\u0027m going to do is say create an interactive dual AIS line graph of these two data points revenue and social media post with the xais being the month use a plotly.js chart so we can hover over these elements on the chart so it is interactive and then I can send it off and because we have this Json it will be able to create this interactive dual AIS line graph much easier I\u0027ve tried this by just using the CSV file and it definitely doesn\u0027t work out as much so if you do want to do some data analysis in clae 3.5 Sonet highly recommend you convert it to Json before you start doing this and this actually looks very similar to chat GPT except they do have their minor differences I like how we get some image settings up here where we can download the plot as a PNG and we can take a snapshot of the plot we can zoom out we can zoom in I think this is pretty cool the next use case for Claude 3.5 that I think it\u0027s amazing at is creating system architectures let me show you how that might work for some something like an SEO tool so I typed out a quick prompt I just said create a system architecture for an SEO web application that allows users to upload blog posts get keyword recommendations feedback score and a ranking criteria right I just want that flowchart that system architecture for this web application that way we can see it and Claude can see it better if we actually go through and build it with Claude if it\u0027s possible now I\u0027m going to send this one off and as you can see it\u0027s going to get coding and it\u0027s going to use mermaid in order to create the system architecture which is very very cool I really like how it breaks it into the databases down here on the left we have a user database blog post database and a keyword database external services and SEO ranking API backend client front end so if you\u0027re trying to do automations or you\u0027re trying to build applications this is going to be huge by building out these system architectures in Claude it does it so quick it\u0027s interactive and it\u0027s a lot better than doing it in something like chat GPT right now use case number 10 is actually to use Claude 3.5 for SEO now we just got that Mach system chitecture created for a web application for SEO but now I actually want to show you how you can build a mini web application in Claude 3.5 use it in the preview section in order to create an SEO tool that will allow you to upload your blog post get keyword suggestions and more so I\u0027m going to start a new chat and Claude and I can just paste in this prompt that I used earlier what I have here is create an SEO tool that allows me to upload my blog post industry and what keywords I\u0027m trying to rank for then I say after I upload all that stuff I want to be able to hit a button that gives suggestions on what to change including a reset button that starts to process over and also add a plus button to keywords so I can add multiple different keywords I\u0027m trying to rank for in the SEO suggestions area after analyzing the SEO give me specific numbers and stats for my blog post as well as caution signs to show what needs attention I can send this off and within seconds it\u0027s gets generating the code and this is just amazing not only for blogs as I\u0027ve been saying but for anything you need a tool for and take a look at this we now have an SEO analysis tool and keep in mind we can edit the styling but right now this is pretty good for about 15 seconds of generating something I\u0027m going to go to chat gbt and grab this blog post that I have on artificial intelligence taking over the world I\u0027m going to paste it in here in clae and now that I have this blog post in here what I can do is I can actually just use this tool within Claude I don\u0027t even have to upload this to some website or make an app out of it I can just test it out in here what industry I can just say technology and then I can type in some keywords here so maybe I want to rank for the keyword AI maybe I want to rank for artificial intelligence and then maybe I want to rank for something like large language models something that might not be as prevalent in this post in specific and then I can just hit analyze SEO then it says word count 800 it gives me an analysis result keyword density 5.88% artificial intelligence 0.25% large language model 0% so if I\u0027m trying to rank for large language models I haven\u0027t even put anything regarding large language model models within here so this is very cool I can hit my reset button this was built with one prompt in about 15 seconds this is amazing this is crazy I haven\u0027t even added anything as you can see I added one extra prompt I said change the styling change the name and then I told it to add a revised blog post section after I upload my initial blog post and as you can see it has the new name the new styling the SEO mro with the wizard this is starting to look like my own little app I can paste in the text right now the text yellow but I can make that whatever I want whenever type in my industry technology type in my keywords again then when I hit analyze SEO what it does is it actually gives me a revised blog post suggestion changes around the blog post a little bit says here\u0027s why I made these changes it added llms to the beginning added large language models to the beginning it added some things that I was lacking within my analysis result and again I could change the styling but for two prompts in a matter of a couple minutes this is awesome this next use case I want to show you is how I built a realtime object detection system using clae and I\u0027m actually going to run it in my browser and show you how this works firsthand I\u0027m just going to come back to Claud and actually paste in this prompt that I used earlier but what we have right now is create a single HTML file for a realtime object detection web application using tensorflow.js and this model I\u0027m not sure if those are zeros or O\u0027s the Coco SSD model this application should and then I just have a bunch of parameters for what this thing should do in order to detect objects on my screen then I tell it to provide the complete runnable HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript make sure I\u0027m in Sonic 3.5 send it off and this is just amazing what this can do and how it can actually generate this for me an object detection web application it\u0027s hard for me to even say that but you can generate this for me and I\u0027m going to show you how it works and actually detects objects and what they are real time using this Library says error over here but watch this as soon as I hit this little download button the bottom right hand corner and then I actually open up this file up top what this going to do is pull me to this screen and it\u0027s going to ask me if this file is okay to use my camera I can just hit allow this time and since I\u0027m actually using the video to record it can\u0027t access the camera but I\u0027ll upload some footage of what that looks like and as you can probably see it completely messed up my camera right now so this is great as you can see it\u0027s detecting objects right now and it\u0027s detecting a person and when it detects an object it labels it here this entire thing was built with Claud remember downloaded it let me hold up something to my camera like a cup and see how it does look for the detected objects down here underneath my face when I hold up a cup see if it gets it cup it thought it was a cell phone at first but then it ended up no actually it thought it was a cup and then it ended up going to a cell phone so this is very interesting let me hold up a water bottle bottle detected isn\u0027t that just insane how it can detect objects let me try holding up something else maybe I\u0027ll try holding up my laptop and see what it says can it detect what a laptop is laptop first detected so this entire thing was actually built using Claude the download file I just got was built and sent from Claude in about 15 seconds using tensorflow and some other things so I\u0027m already starting to build up my Tony Stark lab right this next use case really demonstrates claude\u0027s new Advanced reasoning I want to curate a card counting game so that I can practice counting cards let\u0027s just say and I just to see if Claude can do this I actually know it can do this because I\u0027ve done it previously in Claude 3.5 Sonet and it\u0027s just amazing how much Advanced reasoning goes into this because you have to think about all the different cards in the deck it has to remember which cards it showed me and which cards did not show me again it has to know the card counting system and implement this all into one application that I can use similar to a game but I think card counting has a lot of advanced reasoning especially when you start dealing with decks of cards things can get very complex so that\u0027s why I want to show this one to you so this one took a couple more props but what I told it to do is make a card counting game the card should show the correct number in suit show the user a random number of cards ask what count the deck is the count should always start at zero if the player types in the right count say good job if wrong tell them the actual deck count and restart the entire deck and this thing kind of evolved over time this is what it started as right and it kind of looks okay and it just told me to enter the count right away but I wanted it to run through some cards before I got asked the count of the deck now if you if you\u0027re unfamiliar with card counting it\u0027s something that people do in casinos well I\u0027m not sure if they\u0027re supposed to do it but but you can basically predict what\u0027s coming next in the deck whether it\u0027s a low card or a high card based on adding up a certain number within your head from the cards that are shown to you whether it\u0027s plus one Z or minus one and so I said I want ERS to only submit a guess after you\u0027ve showed them the cards and I wanted it to show five or 10 cards before we got to submit a guess and then this is what it came up with something which is pretty cool so now it\u0027s counting down but it\u0027s only showing the same card right it has this little timer that I asked it to create at a 3se second Pace but now it\u0027s just showing one card and not changing so after multiple times of reiterating that I want to show different cards rather than the same card and ended up coming up with this so now it\u0027s actually changing cards right this is pretty Advanced has a timer it\u0027s changing cards it\u0027s not showing the same cards in the deck which I think is very cool and it\u0027s randomizing it\u0027s a different one every single time so if I restart now it\u0027s at nine if I refresh it\u0027s at six of diamonds so it\u0027s starting with a new card every time and it\u0027s randomizing it and so this was pretty good and after just styling it a little bit more I ended up coming out with this final result this took me about 20 minutes to create the casino card counter I can change my speed that I want so maybe I want the cards coming in every 4 seconds when I hit start game I can now do this right I can now practice my card counting and it goes on my 4C timer in this fun styling and then I can just make a guess after five to 10 cards are shown and I\u0027m going to show you what that screen looks like in a second now I haven\u0027t been counting while doing this so I\u0027m not sure what the count is right now but I\u0027ll just make a little bit of a guess I have no idea I\u0027m just going to put minus one and submit guess the count was one okay so that\u0027s kind of cool that I can practice like that so I can hit continue and then just keep going through the entire deck I just wanted to show you that example in specific to show you the power and the advanced reasoning of Claude 3.5 Sonet the next use case with clae 3.5 Sonet is to create mind maps with it now chat GPT used to be better at this in my opinion using some gpts but after being in Claude I realized how much better Claude actually is at this currently I\u0027m not sure when GPT 40 is going to come out completely when it does we\u0027ll see how it Compares up against this but right now mind maps and Claude are a little bit more visually appealing I feel like I can edit it more and I have a little bit more fun generating them so what I said in my collaud prompt bar was create a mindmap brainstorming content ideas for the artificial intelligence nich YouTube I can send it off and similar to the system architecture it generates this huge mind map and it just looks awesome I can even edit this if I\u0027d like but we have ai YouTube content and it breaks it up into more categories tutorials explainers interviews news and updates case studies debates and discussions and then it goes into even more categories and you can use generated knowledge and then put the generated knowledge into here as well you don\u0027t just have to get the knowledge generated uh in this chat thread you could have something else generated from another chat thread throw it in here you could have a Google sheet with your ideas throw it in here and then get your visual like this Claud 3.5 use case number 14 the second to last use case is to use it for deep learning and further research now you can do so many research things like create research papers with this with interactive graphs categories sections uh headings subheadings so many different things you can go crazy on the Deep learning aspect side of this similar to the interactive dashboard I showed you in the beginning of this video but let me show you an example of how you might be able to create a research paper using clae 3.5 it just is amazing how it does this maybe I\u0027m reading this paper 25 page PDF on multimodal Chain of Thought reasoning in large language models or in just large models pretty hefty and let\u0027s say I want to create a research paper based around that I\u0027m going to download this behind my head and then I\u0027m going to hit save and then I\u0027m going to head over to Claude start a new chat and then I\u0027m going to drag that PDF in here and I\u0027m just going to say create a research poster SLP paper on this PDF use unique visuals in a more complex way of viewing this data then I said make this dark mode with yellow and blue accents create a section of this poster for actionable steps to take and remember this is all based off that PDF that\u0027s 1500 lines right this entire PDF it\u0027s taking all this information it\u0027s reading that PDF and creating a research paper/ poster for me so this is going to help me when it comes to actually viewing this data in a better way maybe if I find a template that I can use then we can use tip number 15 which is about to come up in order to do this for every PDF we get take a look at how this did I think this is just amazing how it breaks the PDF into this fun interactive poster as you can see we are missing an image right here it just says placeholder but let\u0027s say you want this to be a little more interactive you can try something like make this an interactive poster and see what it does if it does anything at all it say it\u0027s going to add expandable sections and Dynamic data visualization and clickable elements so I think making this poster not only a poster with complex viewing compared to the PDF but also turning it into an interactive poster it\u0027s going to be powerful so look at this we now have drop downs so we can hit these dropdowns and kind of go through everything that we want and of course the spacing isn\u0027t all that good but I think this is pretty sweet how it has interactive graphs and performance comparison uh for the multimodal chain up thought prompting then we have even more things that we can kind of click in here and just edit and manipulate actionable steps that\u0027s awesome so this is another way to use Claud Sonic 3.5 is by using it for deep learning research and just furthering your knowledge retention by creating more fun things like this from long drawn out boring PDFs tip number 15 is going to be an important one especially if you stuck it out through this entire video because I know that a lot of you are going to create things that you want right you you\u0027re going to create things that you want to recreate and show people so I\u0027m going to show you the best way to create a prompt template for your specific project right CU after I get done creating a project this is what I\u0027m doing now this is how I got this video done in a fairly decent amount of time is because I had a lot of these prompt templates that you\u0027ve been seeing me use throughout the video so I\u0027m going to show you how to do that now let\u0027s take a look at that example that I just did by making this research paper and let\u0027s say that I want to be able to do this well once I complete it right and once I get it exactly how I want it let\u0027s say that I want to able to do this for every PDF I have I could reply to Claude within the same chat thread and say give me a prompt I could use it would generate this type of interactive poster every single time in Claude how would I ask you for this after uploading my PDF I can send it off and then what it\u0027s going to do is give me a
