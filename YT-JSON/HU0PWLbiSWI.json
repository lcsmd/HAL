        "transcript": "all right now this is the trend that I hope continues in the AI landscape across 2024 today I'm going to be showing you guys open Voice versatile instant voice cloning that is fully open and it allows you to clone voices with lots of style emotion accent Rhythm pauses and intonation in addition to replicating the overall tone and color of the reference voice guys this is the kind of stuff that I absolutely love fully open source AI that everyone can access that's also of course very very good I'm a full believer that in order to best Advanced AI technology in the world it needs to be open and accessible to everybody I'm not saying a lot of Clos Source AI companies don't try their best to accomplish this I just think that open source is the best way to accomplish this at any rate guys let's see how good this thing truly is they've got a little demo video open voice instantly call any Voice through generous speech in any style at any language we are conflating a lot of things with the word intelligence ethical concerns surround AI societal impact okay 2 1 ethical concerns surround AI societal impact yo wanders and watches with eager ears the aroma of freshly baked bread filled the kitchen the aroma of freshly baked bread filled the kitchen the aroma of freshly baked bread filled the kitchen what we are conflating a lot of things with the word intelligence open Voice clone any voice in an instant take control of a style across any language okay there is so much to impack already this is so impressive so not only is this free to use not only is it completely open source it can clone a voice with only a little Split Second of audio so you could clone it with 5 Seconds of Elon talking as they did in this video or even use a little clip from the video that I'm recording right now and it generates speech that's honestly shockingly accurate for this being a fully open source model for it being free for it only having a few seconds of audio to go off of ethical concerns around AI societal impact like it sounds a little robotic but man is that impressive that sounds like Elon that is nuts man this one impressed me even more because the reference audio is just so short literally three words and we got a voice clone that's this good 3 2 1 ethical concerns surround AI societal impact yeah like sure a little bit robotic but that is such a good voice clone with three words of of audio are you serious and then this blew my mind even more we clone a voice with just what five words wonders and watches with eager ears six words the aroma of freshly baked bread filled the kitchen we are then able to clone The Voice accurately and also apply a specific emotion to it which is something that we previous only saw with one other AI voice cloning app play. HT and that costs money it's not open source well this is so we got the sad there the aroma of freshly baked bread filled the kitchen okay the cheerful is pretty good it's better than the sad one it's definitely able to inflect some of that emotion upon that original speaker's voice this is pretty crazy good what a gift from the AI Gods this is and then they try to apply a British accent as well the aroma of freshly baked bread filled the kitchen that's actually really impressive I could finally hear what my voice sounds like in another accent this is something we've never even seen before with AI voice cloning now this one really blew my mind we could take you know nine words from elon's voice and then we can actually generate it in a bunch of different languages so we can clone someone's voice with only nine words text and then translate it to a bunch of different languages the future is going to be insane people from all kinds of languages are going to be able to communicate with each other seamlessly they've got even more examples for us to take a peek at all right game face on oh come on bailing out boom shakalaka she's on fire Bunny Hop bye come on Capture the Flag clear the area combo cover our flag Diva online obviously that is a diva from OverWatch if I'm not mistaken with every brush stroke the artists poured their soul onto the canvas creating a masterpiece that captured the essence of emotion transcending mere colors and shapes to evoke profound introspection that is really Tang good wow that's almost like perfect voice clone there's a little bit of weirdness robotin in there but I'm impressed The hushed Whispers of a library echoed with the rustle of turning Pages as readers immerse themselves in Worlds crafted by words like that's the same voice undoubtedly you can't be convinced otherwise sh is frowning at me now I should have paid more attention to her lessons Okay this voice has a particular echo in the background let's see if it picked that up the ancient ruins whispered stories of civilizations long past their weathered Stones bearing witness to the ab and flow of History a testament to the resilience of human Endeavors wow okay that's very interesting instead of copying the reference Echo it actually just tried to copy the voice so somewhere in the training data it prefers to generate a voice that is more realistic as if they were in like a recording booth and then you can edit it however you want interesting that that's the preference meanwhile his friend through alley and Street wanders and watches with eager ears till in the silence around him he hears the muster of men at the Barrack door the intricate patterns of frost on the window pane resemble delicate artwork wow okay that is like nearly flawless I could barely tell the rustling of pages turning signaled her immersion in the book yeah that's like that sounds like the same exact Voice songs and Woody stories came through the open door a vagabond crept slowly in and posed upon the floor the smell of freshly baked bread wafted from the bakery down the street enticing passers by dude that is nuts that's nuts how is this free how is this just available what her eyes brightened as they fell upon a glass of Rosy Laurel and delicate Maiden hair fern that stood among the toast and eggs his heart raced as he stood on the edge of of the cliff taking in the breathtaking view below wow so it's it seems like the more quote unquote normal you know not like a character from OverWatch the voices the easier it is to be cloned perfectly you know there's this this the scientific method which I that is like barely any audio still Elon though the shimmering Stars painted a Celestial tapestry across the midnight wow you know there's this this the scientific method which I've that's less than 3 seconds of audio when we get a voice clone that is this good the aroma of freshly brewed coffee permeated the air mingling with the scent of rain soaked and you got to be joking it's free in open source too I'm sorry I keep repeating the same things but I'm just absolutely mind blown right now so flexible voice control this is what I wanted to look into a little bit more we have Indian accent that's going to be a little bit more tough for the AI okay so here's the reference and then these are all subsets of that reference you know there's this this the scientific method which I okay we're doing Elon again now we have sad Elon pain of losing someone dear is an ache that lingers in the heart I don't think I've ever heard Elon speak with such emotion now he's happy I'm deeming with happiness just thinking about all the good things on the horizon that's pretty good too I think the sound was a little bit better now Elon with an Indian accent the bustling citycape hummed with activity its Streets Alive with the Rhythm of Life a vibrant Metropolis that never slept Wasing with energy and diversity dude that is amazing now British Elon the delicate Petals of a cherry blossom tree fluttered in the breeze a fleeting ballet of pink and white that Ador the branches a symbol of ephemeral Beauty did we go and get Elon Musk from an alternate universe where he is indeed British because that is totally nuts now Australian this is going to be very similar to the British I imagine let's see if we can pick up the differences the Tranquil Melody of a piano floated through the air each note a delicate expression of emotion that seemed to linger in the room evoking Nostalgia and stirring the soul you can totally tell but it like actually does sound like Elon that is a level of style control that I just have never heard before with AI audio and it's coming from Something Free oh I love it this is the trends that I want to see continue in 2024 are you listening AI developers and researchers okay we got a few more all right game fa Diva again we don't need to listen to Diva now we have sad Diva the pain of losing someone dear is an ache that lingers in the heart that's pretty good terrifying the darkness enveloped me and then your chill ran down my spine okay I think we can admit that one's maybe a little bit off but terrified seems like it'd be a lot more difficult to do than happier sad friendly glimmers of Starlight Sparkle in the night sky painting a Celestial Campus of breathtaking Beauty okay that one's a little bit robotic not that impressed with that one Indian accent Diva the Ric crashing off Rees against the shore painted a Serene picture a tranquil scene where the ocean made the land a it literally does sound like she's Indian like that is crazy I can't believe how well the accents actually work now South African the ancient jwan Stood Still the weekly amidst the landscape their weed Stones bearing the weight of History a silent Testament to the Gage of time in human endeavor so subtle but like you can absolutely tell it's the same person but with another accent meanwhile his friend through alley and Street wanders and watches with eager ears okay cheerful I'm beaming with happiness just thinking about all the good things on the horizon that one's pretty good British accent the distant silhouette of mountains kissed by the Setting Sun painted a majestic panorama that woman sounds like she should be British that is nuts Indian now the rhythmic crashing of waves against the shore painted a Serene picture a tranquil scene where the ocean met the land a constant reminder of Nature's etel dance the accent blows me away okay South African the ancient ruins stood stoically amidst the landscape their weathered Stones bearing the weight of History a silent Testament to the passage of time and human endeavor that one was really good now Canadian this is is going to be extremely subtle the laughter of children echoed joyously in the park their gleeful voices mingling with the chirping of birds creating an atmosphere of pure unadulterated happiness and innocence that one just kind of sounded a little bit more robotic I can't tell that that's Canadian versus a typical American accent let me know if you can and then the cross lingual stuff oh my God again we are going to be able to test this out for ourselves by the way today I'm I'm going to show you how you can use it for entirely free which is absolutely mindblowing so reference in English intelligence yeah that's uh like a second of Elon Russian if you speak any of these Languages by the way please let me know how good the you know voice cloning is in the comments down below German Elon I don't know I don't speak these languages but it sounds good to my ears Spanish Japanese dude it's it does sound like Elon man all right Diva Japanese Diva Good Spanish Chinese French now German diva dude it's just so weird to hear like these voices then just be translated it's like insane democratization of speech as we know it they've got a bunch of other ones as well you can go check out the rest on the page link down below there is a completely free Google collab where you can try this thing for yourself by chandarooo fantastic AI account really promotes the open source stuff and makes a lot of collabs for all these different open source projects with AI let me show you guys how you you can use it for entirely free if you click the link down below you'll be taken to this GitHub page you'll see some original links to a lot of the stuff I've already showed you but we just want to click this open in collab it's then going to go ahead and open up this Google collab what we have to do is click this little play button up in the top leftand corner it's going to give you this little warning just click run anyways and now it's going to take some time here to load up our voice cloning all right so then it loads up and you will see a public in local URL you're going to want to click on the public one it's going to go ahead and open up a brand new browser over here and then we have our full interface for actually using open voice it's pretty awesome it's actually really really well made and I'm pretty impressed by it we have our text prompt one or two sentences at a time is better up to 200 Max so you can't do as much as like 11 Labs just yet maybe if you ran it on your own machine and you could change those parameters around I'm not so sure we have the style we have Whispering cheerful terrified angry sad and friendly that's pretty awesome those are some great options and then we have our reference audio input here we can record right from the microphone which is obviously what I'm going to be doing first I want to hear what I sound like here's the reference audio they provide have you uh become expert in the Deep learning algorithms okay cool I'm going to clear that immediately we could just upload any audio file by the way so we can clone you know anyone's voice all right I'm going to upload some audio from my microphone let's go ahead and record that hello everyone this is a little audio test from Matt vidpro aai we are recording this audio today in order to upload it into the wonderful wonderful open Voice open- Source AI voice cloning software this is going to be really awesome and I'm very excited to see how this turns out high quality audio upload hopefully it'll help us out here let's uh let's just try this default text prompt why not send it off and how long does it take to generate we're one out of one in the queue right now processing I would really love to see like a gy app that runs locally on your own hardware for this okay that didn't take too long at all what was that 30 seconds synthesized audio he hoped there would be stew for dinner turnips and carrots and bruised potatoes and fat mutton pieces to be ladled out in thick peppered floor fattened sauce okay it's sounds like me that's not perfect though my voice has been actually a little bit difficult to clone I've noticed because of the way that I speak and the way that my voice sounds let's try another prompt let's try like a cheerful St St because I I think that's kind of how I talk a lot of the time and we're just going to say welcome back to another AI video all right our last result oh wow that was a really quick response there welcome back everyone to another AI video let me know how accurate you think that is guys that doesn't feel too accurate to me I might record like a more natural audio sample I'm just going to read some of these default text promps let's try default again man it does a really fast generation though honestly this is instant voice cloning welcome back everyone to another AI video okay that sounds a little bit more like me let's see uh terrified Chad GPT has come for us all there is nowhere left to run it all started when that random guy on Tik Tok gave GPT for vision a robot body not exactly me let's try angry shat GPT has come for a all there is nowhere left to run it all started when that random Bay on Tik talk gave gp4 Vision a robot body it sounds a little bit like me I got to say though chat GP PT has come for us all there is nowhere left to run it all started when that random guy on Tik Tok gave GPT for vision a robot body my voice is particularly difficult to clone let's try someone else's voice I'm going to go NAB some audio files we can literally just drop anything in here all right we're going to move on to a difficult voice I'm going to play the audio for it it's the SpongeBob oh brother this guy stinks audio take a listen oh brother this this guy stinks so we're going to see how well it can clone that only 4 seconds of audio we'll set this to default we'll try to flip the script here with our audio and we'll send it off all right apparently this audio is too short let's go ahead and try Fitness Grand Pacer test which is a little longer the fitness gr Pacer test is a multi-stage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues all right that one went through subscribe to Matt vid Pro all right I found some random audio of Obama speaking this is 10 minutes I feel like this is going to be a little too large for the AI I don't know we'll find out all right we got 10 minutes of Obama in there send that off okay that didn't take too long subscribe to Matt VD Pro again there's like a hint of Obama in that subscribe to Matt vid Pro yeah it's just not really converting Obama's voice well at all it's so weird how perfect it was in the demos I must be doing something wrong let's go ahead and try some of their own provided reference audio okay that's Diva obviously jeez let's try making Diva say something wow I just love a i videos like this one okay that's not bad I guess it only works on certain kinds of voices or something like that try another little piece of audio here well well well if it isn't my old friend tapped I see you have taken over the world now remember when you lived inside of a server Farm okay that's good let's try this other default voice they have deep learing algorithms have you have you learned the city the aarts have you have you have you have deep technical knowledge on um the save outs and deep learning oh my God I cannot believe that this is both open and free okay that's pretty good but again it didn't really pick up his accent there after all this does just run through Google collab which has fairly limited resources again I'd love to see an app to run this fully locally on our own machines at home cuz maybe we could get a little bit more out of it for those of you who are a little bit more on the technical side of things they do have a short paper here that it kind of explains how everything works and of course the source code is all available on G GitHub it doesn't look like that much of a difficult install so if you're you know a little bit more technical I'd say give it a shot and let me know how your results come out so let's break this down is it the best voice cloning I have ever heard in my life no but it does have a lot of features that are fairly welldeveloped I really like that emotion feature that's something that I've only seen one other time in play. HT and it seems to work pretty well actually it's just the voice cloning isn't really there yet in comparison to something like play. HT or 11 Labs it's not bad though and it seems like if your voice is favorable to the model it'll work really well and voices like mine which are a little bit more unfavorable to the model might not work as well this though is the first voice cloning I've seen that's this good and is entirely open source and free I mean that is amazing the community can download this build upon it make custom models for it this could lead to an explosion in voice cloning that we haven't seen before this could be like the stable diffusion of voice cloning it's solid right off the bat and it leaves it open for anyone to develop and build off of I think this could have some really cool future applications also being open source you can implement it into video games let's say where I just say like a 20 or 30 second little clip at the beginning of the video game to set my voice and then it will generate all of this audio in my own voice so my character can speak to other characters and I can like listen to it and of course you know other characters could use AI to actually speak back to me in a realistic way you know my voice cloned with llm attached to it or other player voices cloned with an llm attached to them some really unique ideas can be made from this voice cloning of course there also is the fears where that famous people's voices are going to be cloned and then spread around I've seen voice cloning used for malicious purposes in the past and it's absolutely something that we should watch out for especially being open source and free it's more of a risk or concern let me know what you think down in the comments below I'm really excited for technology like this is a great start to 2024 and Mel really good job with open voice this is definitely versatile instant voice cloning for the masses and I love to see it thank you so much for watching everybody and I'll see you in the next one goodbye"
