        "transcript": "so open aai has finally launched the GPT store and there is a plethora of information that you need to understand so let's dive into exactly what the GP store is exactly what you need to understand and how you about to start making money with this creative opportunity so opening ey released this tweet in which they showcased the GPT store and you can see here that the GPT store as of now is officially available currently it is being rolled out to several users across the globe I mean you know pretty much all users across the globe but I do think that currently what we will have is first of all a USA release and then of course a Europe release because many people are reporting that they don't actually have access to this now I am not the only one that is currently experiencing this because if you are searching for this and you are thinking where on Earth is the GPT store did they launch it or not what is going on that is one of the things you should understand is that I believe it is slowly being rolled Across America and then eventually going to be worldwide now essentially they also did tweet this so you can see that this is the official tweet and it wasn't that long ago but of course I've compiled all the relevant information that you're going to need to know so since I don't actually have access to this and many people don't have access to it just yet but I do want to get this tutorial out to you as quickly as possible you can see that there is a walkthrough of this store so this guy on Twitter posted a gpg store video walkr showing the listed in each category and saying that the global search is not live and the stats are only shown in the featured so you can see right here that when you are looking through the store you can see how it is sorted so we do have a trending Tab and opening I actually did release a blog post which I will go through that has all the details that you need to know and essentially you can see that this is the trending tab which essentially means that it's going to show you the most popular gpts by usage and this is going to be changing every week and you can see right here these are some of the gpts that you may have actually seen beforehand on various different other websites so you can see then here we've got a filter and it's filtered by things that actually use and focus on Dar and this is mainly going to be Graphics related things or could be like a fitness GPT that is able to use and identify objects or things in images and then of course turn that into a healthy recipe then of course we do have the writing tab which is enhance your writing with tools for creation editing and style refinement and essentially what we're going to have here is mainly just different ways to write within specific Styles you can see humanized AI text is a text converter tool that can convert AI generated text to humanlike text and this is something that I have been doing myself in order to write small things because when you look at a generated text all the time it you can actually start to see the patterns in a generated text it seems so professional so bullet pointy and just too coherent in just certain things like it just seems AI generated if that makes sense that's just the best way to put it so you know something like that humanized AI um I'm not surprised that that is going to be something that is going to be one of the top in writing then of course we've got fully SEO optimized articles including FAQs rank math SEO optimized content writers and I'm pretty sure that these gpts are going to be continually updated with whatever the best industry practices are for whatever SEO site you are going to be doing it for and then of course you can see here these are ones for productivity so AI PDF which essentially if you're looking at a research paper looking at some kind of PDF you can get this to essentially allow files that are hundreds of PDF 2 GB per file upload it and scan it and then of course we have other ones like canva and video GPT by Ved and mean it does allow for video creation but I do want to say the videos aren't that great just yet but of course we then have the research and Analysis tab which shows us you know all of these different gpts right here but before I want to dive into all of these gpts let's actually take a look at the blog post that opening ey actually showed us because the blog post is rather telling so it does talk about the trending Tab and it says discover what's trending in the store the store features a diverse range of gpts developed by our partners and the community browse popular and trending gpts on the community leaderboard with categories like darly writing research programming education and lifestyle so it's clear that the trending tab is going to be one of the ones where if for example a new trend comes out and everyone knows that chat GPT conversations sometimes do go viral and there are many new things that do pop up if something does go trending we are going to see that appear on the trending tab by having a ranking based on the most interactive gpts every week and that is going to be something that is truly fascinating because I can guarantee even if you aren't on Twitter or even if you aren't on Reddit if you just click explore on the store you're going to be able to see exactly what is becoming really really popular then of course they do actually talk about the weekly updates so you can see here that there are going to be new gpts featured every week it says we will also highlight useful and impactful gpts some of our first gpts include personalized Trail recommendations from all Trails search and synthesize results from 200 million academic papers with consensus expand your coding skills with carmy's code tutor design presentations or social posts with canva and find your next read with books and of course learn math and science anytime anywhere with ck12 Flexi AI tutor and I do find that some of these I know a lot of people you know might critique gpts and say that what is the point if chat GPT can do it all I mean like I've said before there are very very good use cases for example I'm guessing that the books GPT is going to be you know having a lot of data on new books that are released and essentially it's you know been instructed to mainly focus on searching for books because a lot of the times when I've tried to search for certain book summaries um I've had to tell chat gbt that look this is a book it was released this year and then it's able to be like oh yeah it was a book it was released this year here is the information so um I'm pretty sure that that is why gpts are really useful and I can't wait to see what new feature gpts are going to be coming in every single week so here we have include your GPT in the store building your own GPT is simple and doesn't require any coding skills as many of you may know if you've watched the previous tutorials that I've made on how to actually make a GPT now it says of course here if you haven't done this before and you do want your GPT to be eventually published in the store make sure you save your GPT for everyone and anyone with a link will not be shown in the store and verify your Builder profile by going to settings Builder profile and enable your name or a verified website and we make sure in the previous video I did talk about this how to um use the usage policies and the GPT brand guidelines to ensure your GPT is compliant I might include a clip from that video at the end of this just so that you know you don't have to click away you can just watch it again it isn't that crazy but essentially it's basically like don't do anything illegal don't do anything related to gambling don't do anything that you know would violate the TOs um and when you're naming your GPT just name it whatever it is don't name it like AI grid GPT just name it the AI grid if that was what it was called so there's a few kind of small things that you should just pay attention to in there um and that is something that you do want to do if you're able to get that and of course users able to report gpts so that is going to be something you do want to be aware of you know really don't abuse the system because gpts do actually get taken down someone actually had a GPT called GPT 5 and it actually was taken down so quickly although it did actually get a lot of different chats but it was actually taken down pretty quickly so don't abuse that system because I know some people might think oh I'm just going to abuse it but just trust me it is not worth it at all it's best just to stick with the guidelines so then of course we have here how much will users earn you can see here that this is the very important part and I do have some really good information for you all so it says that Builders can earn based on GPT usage so in q1 we will launch a GPT Builder Revenue program as a first step us Builders will be paid based on user engagement with their gpts and we will provide details on the criteria for payment as we get closer so q1 the dates of q1 are January 1st to March the 30th first so it seems that we only have around 2 months for them to release this so I guess you could say within the first 3 months of the year this is going to be released and something that you need to pay attention to is that they said the first step us creators essentially will be paid based on user engagement with their gpts so I'm thinking that maybe due to regulations or maybe they just want to test it out in the USA first they're going to be releasing that you know I guess you could say monetization program in America first now additionally what they do say is that you're going to be paid based on the engagement with their gpts if you aren't familiar with the many schemes and programs that companies do have when interacting with their software in order to get it to a wider audience they have many different ways that you can do this and engagement is a very interesting one because largely what we've seen before is that you know and I'm guessing the case like this is because it's a new type of system we usually see affiliate based methods or methods that are based on you know payments like commission so for example if someone buys something for $10 and you know you'll have a referral link you get a kickback of maybe a dollar and that kind of adds up when you have hundreds and thousands of people purchasing through your affiliate link but I'm guessing that this is not the case so it's going to be based on how many people interact with your thing now I think that this might be a bit different because I think what open AI might actually do here is to have an entire fund so for example what they might do and this is just purely speculation because they're going to be earned based on engagement with their gpts and of course we don't know exactly how that's going to work but I think that it might be a situation where they have maybe like you know a $50 million fund and every month they dish out you know a portion of that to the top 100 or top 1,000 gpts in terms of user engagement I don't I don't think opening ey would put $100 million maybe a little bit less because the company isn't making money but I'm guessing that you know since many other companies have done this before like Snapchat had a creativity program they were literally paying out a million dollars a Day to you know these top Snapchats every single day so I'm guessing that you know a company like open aai could potentially do something similar since it's just based on engagement and isn't based on like Affiliates or referrals to the GPT system so also what they did say is we'll provide details on the criteria for payments so I'm guessing that there's going to be some kind of Engagement threshold so maybe you need to reach you know 10,000 chats or maybe you need to have a certain amount of people interacting every day I'm guessing that there's probably going to be some kind of dashboard to be able to number one track how many users are interacting with your chats where they're coming from how long they're staying and the kind of conversations that they're having in fact I don't actually think they're going to be able to tell you the kind of conversations that they're having but they might be able to tell you you know how long they're staying for um and if the chats lead to more chats so um another possible method just based on industry trends that we've seen is something that is working seemingly for po now PO is essentially an AI website that does host chat GPT it hosts Clause I'm pretty sure it hosts Gemini too and it allows you to access them with bots in a similar way to the GPT store and essentially looking at their monetization structure we can potentially remember this is a possible method open AI has not stated that this is how it's going to be done but I'm just brainstorming here so pose monetization methods is uh two components it says if a bot causes a user to subscribe to PO measured in a few ways we'll share a cut of the revenue pay immediately and you can set a per message message fee and we'll pay that on every message starting soon and we're working on setting up a system to manage this um and they also did create a monetization available only to the US residents but we'll be expanding it to other countries soon so I'm guessing that these are a few ways that they're going to be monetizing it because it's a different kind of system so their monetization I'm guessing what they probably going to do is just test it out see whichever method does work and then whichever method is the most effective then that's the one that they're going to be using so yeah causing someone to subscribe um I'm gu guing that could be a way you know setting a per message fee of course in some chats maybe you do want a per message fee I remember previously there was someone who created an AI girlfriend and that AI girlfriend actually had a per message thee I'm not exactly sure how much it was but she made $770,000 in a week so you can definitely see that in certain instances it could be something that is very very lucrative so we don't know exactly how you're going to be paid but either way I think it's either a going to be some kind of fund that is distributed to the most engaging gpts B it's either going to be you know some kind of affiliate or C it probably might be something that we haven't even thought of so it's just pure speculation if you have any ideas or comment is always always great and in addition of course like I said it's probably just USA first and then the rest of the world because other people are also experienc this this same issue as you can see right here they're saying same same same same in lvia same in Italy um so this is not something that is just to you so let's take a look at some of the examples of the gbts right now in the store that are doing very very well because arguably if you're watching this video you'll likely want to see what you could do yourself so here we have consensus which is number one I think in research and it says introducing consensus GPT your research your AI research assistant so you can see here this person is researching does creatine improved cognition and you can get direct answers grounded in scientific studies so um you know then you can do different searches and I think this is going to be used by you know a lot of people who are at University for example those who are trying to to get citations for papers um and of course you can see find me certain papers in this year this is going to be definitely something that is used by college students and University students across the globe because um finding this kind of stuff embedded in chat GPT just makes it a lot easier and of course we have something that is really hilarious like honestly um and this is why you know all sorts of gpts are going to be really done well if you managed to do them well and they could do well so you can see here there's a new app at the GPT store that went live today called called gen Z for meme where you can drop a meme into it and it will describe its interpretation of what the meme is I dropped one of Elon musk's latest memes and this is what it answered so it says when you both know ending disaster but you don't care and of course you have the description which essentially says we know this is going to be a hot mess but YOLO so I think something like this you know something that takes advantage of chat gpt's understanding its deep level of understanding um in a simple and fun and humorous way and something that can be like shared around um is definitely Ely something that is going to be useful because a lot of people are going to be on one end creating very serious and very you know Ai and API driven um gpts with all of these kind of crazy you know actions with zapia and on the other end you do have some people that are going to be creating you know simple gpts that are going to be taking advantage of chat gpt's personality and chat gpt's humor there was also another GPT that was like a hot dog certifier and it would took a picture of um anything and it says is it a hot dog or not and you put in a picture of hot dog is like yes this is a hot dog you're putting a picture of something random and it's like no this is not a picture of a hot dog and you know stuff like that where it's just you know I guess you could say a strange kind of humor could definitely have some kind of Engagement in ways you might not think then of course we do have scholar AI which is one of the number one science plugins on chat GPT and it's essentially something that also helps researchers and clinicians to work with a trustworthy AI by their side and it connects users to peer-reviewed research articles so trying to review some research that is peer reviewed to make sure you know it is topnotch this is what you're going to be using now additionally if we do take a look at some of the screenshots that have been floating around you can see that there is of course certain categories like lifestyle we've got you know tattoo GPT generates you know tattoo ideas designs healthy Chef recipe creator with Visual and nutritional insights astrology birth chart cocktail gbt Riz GPT screen print GPT life OS gym streak workout Creator Home St visor there's many different things and you have to understand that chat TPT is a very very powerful system and I would argue that it can pretty much do a lot of the things that you think of and definitely if you are creative this is going to be something that helps you out a ton so I would say that based on what we do have here the monetization is going to be rolling out soon to us first based on how that does go I'm guessing that they're then going to tr that into the rest of the world and based on how that goes that's how we're going to have our official monetization thing now I'm not sure how openi is going to do the monetization but I do think it will be interesting to see how they do manage to do it and I do wonder if it's going to be like some of these other social media apps because you know like I said before Snapchat had a creativity program and so did Tik Tok and YouTube has a very easy way to distribute revenue because it's simply just based on advertisers so it will be interesting to see how openai goes about this maybe like I said they might just have like a daily engagement amount or some kind of fund but either way this is definitely a very big thing now chat GPT actually did announce teams so essentially if you want a team plan which is for your team so for example if you have a company and rather than you know getting a lot of different personal ones you can get a chat GPT team plan for all you know kinds of sizes so you have an access to a private section of the GPT store which includes gpts securely published to your workspace and the GPT store will be available soon for Enterprise customers which will include enhanced admin controls choosing how internal only gpts are shared which external gpts may be used inside your business and like all usage on chat GPT and team Enterprise we do not use your conversations with gpts to improve our model so this was a very very comprehensive update on the GPT store if you want to take a look at the entire chat GPT teams maybe you're someone who owns a company or kind of business um this is definitely going to be something for you because often I do know that when you are working with people and you're trying to get them to integrate chat gbt into their workflow this is going to be really really useful because you can actually give your team chat GPT and you can give them certain things it's just really really cool and it costs $25 per month per user when build annually or $30 a month per user and essentially this web page here just talks about why this is really good for teams and I think it's useful rather than using you know your personal account for work so this is definitely going to be something that is really effective now of course if you do want to go ahead and take a look at the full blog that will be linked in the description below but other than that let me know what your thoughts are about gbts if you are excited when you are going to be publishing your gpts and any other things you think I may have missed so one of the issues that I did just quickly want to add they actually did just give me access to gpts um and I'm guessing it's probably just rolled out you know worldwide probably by now but uh one of the things that you do see is that when you're actually searching for gpts on GPT store whatever your app is I'm guessing the open AI needs some way to add some kind of verification because currently we are facing a small issue where what we're having is you can see that there is one designer GPT with 25 offal chat but there are many other copycats created by other people I'm not sure if open is going to you know make this as a terms of service violation but the impersonation from these other apps isn't of course good so I'm guessing that there's probably going to have to be some kind of verification or some kind of unique image that is going to be I guess you could say quickly copyrighted by the GPT store because um this is a small small issue and of course you know when you are searching for gpts you can see exactly how big these gpts are in essentially their chats yeah this is going to be a really really a really really fun thing once we do get some amazing and creative gpts"
