        "transcript": "are the solutions to many of our medical conditions accessible within ourselves using technology available to our bodies for free our pharmaceutical industries keeping this information from us is it possible that you can breathe yourself into a better state of health i spoke to james nester the author of the book breath the science of breathing and we talked about many aspects of breath and how respiration could be the solution and inspiration a place of connection we talked about many other aspects of breath i think you're going to love this conversation have a look it feels like you can't discuss something as rudimentary as respiration without encroaching on the territory of sociology and biopolitics and the way that our lives have been managed and mismanaged did write in this book become politicized for you um that's a good question and uh it wasn't at the beginning because i spent years and years on this book um talking with researchers who have been studying this stuff for for decades literally no one was really listening to them they were publishing these weird academic journals with these terrible titles on the on their papers and you know the book came out six weeks into a pandemic obviously we had no idea that this was going to happen the book was scheduled to come out six months beforehand and a lot of political movements based around breathing um and and people being denied breath so it was all of these things a respiratory pandemic this political movement together that i think allowed people to try to re-contextualize their relationship with breathing which is something that again seems so simple but but it's really not it's not binary it's it's not that we do it or don't do it there's so many permutations within it what why did you embark on this five-year odyssey what was the inciting incident and why it sounds hard yeah well i never uh intended to to write a book about breathing that wasn't something i set out to do but i kept finding stories and people in incidences that that didn't add up and what i mean by that is i was sent out on an assignment to write about free divers these are people who can hold their breath for like five six seven eight minutes at a time and dive the depths below what scientists thought was possible and i saw this and i went back and reported it and people said no you can't do that you're gonna die well i saw there there's the video and then these free divers told me about people who are using breathing to heal themselves of incurable conditions and to heat themselves up literally to they were able to sit in ice for an hour at a time and heat themselves up with breathing i thought this was all bs until i went out in the field and found that it's 100 percent true it's been scientifically validated and all the proof is out there and yet so many of us still don't consider our breath to be this powerful thing is it a particular tradition this free dive in in a particular location all over the world people have been doing this there's archaeological evidence that dates back 10 000 years so this is how you used to get red coral which grows below about 30 meters you would have to free dive for it the greeks were really into free diving um you know pearl diving is what what they called it um the japanese were very into free diving they still are the amma divers all women divers so all over the world in coastal areas people were free diving they understood the power of holding your breath what the breath could do for you and then even after that ancient cultures have been writing about breathing as a medicine for literally thousands of years that's what yoga is yoga began as a technology of breathing there were no movements to it before what are the implications for materialist uh scientific study if there are arcane methodologies that are discovered and put into practice without access to the kind of enhanced sensory data that underwrites much of our modern understanding of breathwork well what's so great about breathing is it's so easy to measure right now a lot of people have instruments heart rate variability monitors blood pressure cuffs at their houses pulse oximeters but even you go into a lab and it's it's very easy to measure what happens to the brain what happens to your circulation your heart rate your nervous system function and so that you know before 100 years ago we weren't able to do this which is why nobody in the west really believed that breathing could take us to all these places and do all of these things they believed it in the east because they had anecdotal evidence they could see it transforming people but that's what what really sort of turned the dial for me is to know that i could go into a lab and i could talk to people scientists at top institutions who were studying this stuff and measuring it once you have data and measurements it's really hard to argue that something isn't working i mean there it is right there in front of you you think that that's in a sense now that we have access to this these systems of measurement you can't walk it back and consider that at some point these things were presumably experientially founded but for me obviously i see it as ancillary to chant in meditative techniques cities the potential for levitation kinetic kinetic powers some of the other ideas that are spoken of scripturally and vedically where you know as you've pointed out a great deal of this sort of breath technology is sort of explained in detail i i kind of perhaps because of my own nature it seems to me that you're sort of uh you enjoy as do i uh scientific discoveries scientific method and scientific representation of data because of precisely because of the empiricism but i also like the conjecture around mystery and the idea that in our pursuit of modernity under the auspices of the myth of progressivism we have discarded information that would be valuable to us as individuals that has only been neglected because it's difficult to commodify and to turn into a product i believe that some of that is is true i heard from various researchers i won't name them again at top institutions they said that the reason why more people aren't hearing about this is you can't make money off of breathing it's really hard this is something free it's available to everyone everywhere we carry around our breath with us all day long all night long and we can hone that and and really get some benefits from it so you know along the lines of of people not believing things and and looking at data and changing people's minds there is this tradition in in buddhist and monasteries in which to go up to the next level of monk hood you have to sit outside at night and breathe and melt a circle in the snow during winter and this had been written about for hundreds and hundreds of years this guy naropa wrote about a thousand years ago and then this this belgian french anarchist opera singer by the name of alexandria david neal went out to the himalayas for 14 years and rediscovered this still nobody believed it until herbert benson at harvard medical center medical school went out to dharmsallah got these monks hooked them up with all these sensors and showed that they were able to do this they were able to heat up their extremities by 17 degrees just by breathing they were able to dry wet sheets over their shoulders in a cold room just by breathing and that paper came out in the 80s and you still get people that say oh this is impossible we can't do that well you can see the videos of it and you can read the scientific paper which was published in nature the most esteemed scientific journal in the world so you know there's only so much of that you can do for people who um try to deny the power of this stuff look at the data and look at the science and and then you can have a discussion what do you think about uh what did that breath look like the one that could dry sheets and stuff did it look dramatic it looked like wim hof i'm sure you're you're familiar with wim so he's he's just adopted this breathing technique and he's very i talked with wim semi often amazing guy he's done more to bring awareness to breathing than in my opinion than anyone else in the last hundred years but he didn't invent any of this stuff and people didn't believe wim could do this stuff until you know he broke 26 world records you know he's hiking up everest in short you know running running a marathon he's sitting in an ice bath for two hours without getting frostbite and hypothermic hypothermia it's supposed to be impossible and uh and it's so finally so many people have gotten the message and they're using his his methods not only to heat themselves up but to overcome autoimmune diseases which they were told were incurable so it really feels like with scientific measurement right now and with access to all of these ancient methods which used to be very secretive we're coming to a moment where people are starting to really understand and acknowledge that the power of their breathing that's pretty cool so we could align these ancient mystical methods with modern scientific measurement tools to kind of underwrite a new approach to you know yeah biology and survival and thriving and of course i do know him and i'm a tremendous fan of him you know of course his work and also his extraordinary personality the sort of easy i would say nordic even though i know he's dutch but the sort of viking bombast of having the character around your house which i've had the privilege of uh experiencing he came with his son who's like he's a misery isn't he in arms like so that wim can communicate with earth and like i feel like um yeah i do that and i've done that breathing today actually and after you that i can after four or five rounds of wim hof inhalation exhalation for uh body capacity breathing uh hold my breath for four minutes i mean that's impressive because given that my you know at first it should struggle to a minute and then after one round a couple of minutes etc um but like it's fascinating that people can swim around you know for six or eight minutes underwater with that kind of pressure i just i suppose what what much of whims work illustrates is unexplored capacities of human potential that are not necessarily connected to something you need to buy but just techniques that you can learn and also i like it that another thing i like about wim is how democratic he is about like anyone can do it anyone can do it it's not i'm not special you know it's a he's sort of a yogi really isn't he's gone on a mission of devotion through breath and yeah as you say it's difficult to think of someone comparable and you know he's just one person in a long line of people who have been able to harness these abilities there was this other guy swami rama in the 1970s he allegedly could do all of these incredible things with meditation and breathing nobody believed it he went into a lab with a navy physicist and was able to move around the temperature on the same hand 11 degrees fahrenheit from his pinky to his thumb and he was able to make his heart flutter at 300 beats a minute and this was written about in the new york times so uh and it was all measured there by again a navy physicist you know not not a uh some some new age dude so uh the fact that these stories have been around for so long but people just sort of say huh that's interesting anyway you know but back to my pepsi and and tiger king i think is interesting because these stories reveal something about our bodies and and what they're capable of and i think that they also reveal something about how we can heal ourselves in the future and and progress as a species instead of regress yeah i think that's exactly the implication and it's a challenging one when pursued because any idea that challenges the interests of the powerful and the prevailing myth you know that that's obviously disruptive and it's i think it's interesting to speak about it in these terms and i accept that people need to understand it both sort of sign need to see it scientifically and then it needs to be popularized and made accessible precisely because of the health benefits and i see the correlations that you draw between breath and diet and i see how both of these cases it's the result of suffering endured because we've become detached from our nature it's interesting like that these sort of um you know enlightenment rationalist ideas when challenged uh you're always charged with either you know that is roman you're a romantic and the noble savage type um idea but i said so perhaps that's why and just because i suppose you accept the conditions of our time are keen to present this information in terms of what can be measured right i'm going to cut you off there i'm going to cut you off the nib and the nub the nub is where i'm cutting you off if you're enjoying this conversation join me over at luminous the rest of our discussion for all the
