        "transcript": "that's lighting is a modern colloquial term meaning that you are being manipulated within a relationship I suppose generally within a romantic relationship where a person is governing your idea of reality it comes from the Hitchcock film Gaslight or a person I think dial glides up and down and flow hey did you turn that light on no I've not watched the film I probably should but basically means you're manipulating someone in a relationship and tricking them into thinking that they're going mad so I feel like though you know I'm maybe on the scale with that a little bit because I do blame my wife for things a little too much but as a conscious person I try not to designate my problems or what I wanna say deposit my problems on another person's you can't control your problems if you don't take responsibility for them what about if you feel you're being ghastly what I suppose what that would mean is that you're in a relationship with someone and they're really making you unsettled and really making you unhappy and really not make making you feel undervalued I think it's a very good exercise in life to look at the relationships you have and think what do I get in this relationship what do I give in this relationship start to try and understand the truth of it if you're not happy in a friendship or a romantic relationship is it possible that you could leave it can you recognize that it's a problem envisage that change is possible ask for helping changing it I've been in relationships that have altered evolved and grown where I've learned to behave more healthfully and correctly or been officially in the relationship but other relationships have simply had to end because we can never be mutually supportive the chemistry the Kappa compatibility ain't present if you feel that you're in a relationship that's been sustained by manipulation or gaslighting then you have to even renegotiate that relationship or leave it you can't stay spellbound and hypnotized in a relationship that is taken from you meditation is good because your consciousness and your awareness expands new decisions new ideas come to you the possibility for change comes but you need to be engaged in therapeutic and connected relationships in your life you can't only operate on the frequency of banal communication can you you need to get some true for North anticip I have it I'm surrounded by people telling me that don't rustle your maniac that's not true that's not real challenged quite often but also heard compassionately so if you feel that you are in a relationship that is not nutritional it's not bringing out the best part of you you need to renegotiate it or you need to leave it thank you"
